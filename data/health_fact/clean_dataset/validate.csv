2,29558,Germany has banned pork from school canteens because it offends Muslim 'migrants.',"March 7, 2016","What's true: Some politicians complained that less pork was being served in Germany, diluting the country's culinary cultural heritage. What's false: Germany has banned pork in any way, shape, or form.",Kim LaCapria,"On 7 March 2016, British tabloid Express reported that some German cafes and schools were phasing out pork products. The headline (“GERMANY BANS SAUSAGES”) naturally made some readers infer that the country had banned pork entirely. The article itself described a less alarming scenario, in which a single politician said that pork was slowly disappearing from schools and cafeterias, and extrapolating that it was because Muslims were possibly objecting to its presence: SCHOOLS and canteens in Germany have BANNED pork from their menus over fears of offending Muslim migrants, a top politician has revealed. An increasing number of public canteens, child daycare centres and schools have stopped serving sausages, bacon and ham over religious considerations. Now members of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party are fighting to keep pork on the menu, insisting the consumption of pork is part of German culture. Daniel Günther, party representative, claimed that pork products were being taken off the menu in schools, nurseries and canteens across the country. He said: “The protection of minorities – including for religious reasons – must not mean that the majority is overruled in their free decision by ill-conceived consideration. The paper surmised such a “move” would deepen resentment over immigration in Germany, without specifying precisely what, exactly, was moving: The move is likely to cause tensions among residents who support the introduction of restrictions on the inflow of refugees to the country. At around the same time, readers also asked about a Daily Mail piece making a similar claim about pork, reporting that schools in a locality in England (not Germany) were replacing pork with “halal meat”: Parents have condemned a school’s decision to ban all pork products from the menu and replace other meats with halal versions. Pupils aged between three and 11 at Brinsworth Manor Infant and Junior Schools in Rotherham – which Ofsted identifies as having only a small number of pupils from minority ethnic groups – will no longer be able to enjoy sausages, bacon or ham. Parents at both schools, which share a site, were told of the decision in a letter from Rotherham Council’s principal catering officer Ron Parry, who wrote that there had been ‘minor adjustments’ to the lunch menu. While many thought this article came out around the same time as the Germany one, it was actually already two years old (from 7 March 2014), and concerned one particular area in England, not Germany. That story also contained the following reportage, which appeared to partially contradict its initial claims: The school governors at both schools are understood to have agreed to the menu change to ensure the meals are more inclusive. A spokesman for Rotherham Borough Council confirmed that school meals at both Brinsworth Manor schools have changed and now include halal and non-halal meat on the menu. She added that the Schools Catering Service supplies about 17,000 school meals every day to children at infant, junior, primary and secondary schools in Rotherham. She said: ‘The provision of both halal and non-halal is not unusual in Rotherham’s school. Currently, nine schools out of 115, select one of our menus that provide a mix of both halal and non-halal meals. ‘All meat on our menus, including halal, is sourced from reputable companies, which fully comply with the quality standards of the relevant individual meat boards.’ At any rate, the “pork ban” didn’t last even last until the end of March 2014; it was soon reversed, mostly due to pressure by far-right and nationalist political groups. On 1 March 2016, news outlet Deutsche Welle covered the matter of Germany’s vanishing pork. According to that report, politician Daniel Günther had complained about what he perceived as a decreased number of pork-based items on cafeteria menus: CDU parliamentary group leader, Daniel Günther, bemoaned on Tuesday that an increasing number of canteens, nurseries and schools are removing pork from their menu due to religious considerations. “The protection of minorities – including for religious reasons – must not mean that the majority is overruled in their free decision by ill-conceived consideration,” Günther said, arguing that tolerance also means “the appreciation and sufferance of other food cultures and lifestyles.” Günther told local German newspaper “Lübecker Nachrichten” that at least one nursery in every voting district had stopped serving pork after taking Muslim children into consideration. “The consumption of pork belongs to our culture,” he argued, adding that those who didn’t want to eat pork didn’t have to. “No one should be obliged to do so,” he said. “But we also don’t want the majority having to refrain from pork.” Deutsche Welle also provided more contextual information. According to its article, many Germans mocked the initiative and felt it was completely without merit: The CDU’s proposal was met with a wave of mockery on Tuesday, particularly on Twitter where the hashtag #schweinefleischpflicht – meaning “pork duty” – became Germany’s top trending hashtag by late Tuesday afternoon. Accompanied with an image with the words “Wurst case scenario” – wurst being the German word for sausage – Germany’s Green party tweeted: “Now we finally know what the CDU meant with dominant culture.” The WWF in Berlin also criticized the CDU proposal. “At present there is little evidence that the pork cutlet and chop must be placed on the menus of German canteens as a protected species,” the wildlife protection organization quipped. The exaggerated claims about pork bans in Germany weren’t the first of their kind to appear in British media sources. An October 2015 press frenzy centered around purported bans on pork in UK offices (nothing was banned), and in June 2015 the Daily Mail claimed Muslims demanded someone’s grandfather be exhumed (again, false). In 2014 claims circulated that KFC banned hand wipes because they were prohibited by Islam (they weren’t), and around the same time a questionable story made the rounds about a couple booted from a bus for offending Muslims by singing the theme song to Peppa Pig. While it was true one or (at most) a few German politicians “bemoaned” what they believed was a disappearing presence of pork in school cafeterias, misleading headlines indicated that there was a “ban on pork”. Finally, a number of Germans mocked the assertions as ludicrous and baseless.",false,Politics
3,8416,Coronavirus prompts Canada to roll out safe drugs for street users.,"April 16, 2020","Canada’s Pacific province of British Columbia was already battling an opioid epidemic when the new coronavirus hit, compounding the threat to drug users, many of whom are homeless and particularly vulnerable during the pandemic.",Tessa Vikander,"In March, the Canadian government urged provinces to lower barriers to prescription medications - allowing doctors to provide prescriptions for controlled substances by phone and  pharmacists to deliver them - to better help citizens to practice physical distancing and self-isolation. B.C. is the first province to apply those guidelines to support people who use street drugs. Healthcare providers are  ramping up the supply of prescription drug replacements for those who live with addictions to drugs like heroin, and even dispensing some of them via unique vending machines. “We’ve taken these exemptions and we’re running with them at break-neck speed,” said Judy Darcy, provincial Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. The goal is to “bring down the number of people who are dying of overdose,” she said. The Downtown Eastside is where the majority of Vancouver’s homeless population resides. In 2019, the city had 2,223 homeless residents, about a third of whom live with opioid or methamphetamine addictions. By providing a safe supply of legal drug alternatives, the province hopes to lower a sudden spike in drug overdose deaths that coincided with the coronavirus outbreak in Vancouver. Overdose deaths in the city had been declining over the  past year with implementation of safe consumption sites and availability of naloxone overdose reversal kits. But between March 23 and 29, police in Vancouver responded to eight suspected overdose deaths, the most in a single week since August 2019. The following week, they attended eight more. Cheyenne Johnson, co-interim executive director at the B.C. Centre on Substance Use, said the region’s illicit drug supply was already tainted. The coronavirus closure of the border with the United States has exacerbated the problem by stymying illegal drug supply routes, prompting dealers to increasingly make or cut their wares with dangerous ingredients. “As the effects of the pandemic continue to unfold, the illicit drug supply is likely to become significantly more adulterated and toxic,” Johnson said. Before the new guidelines came into place, some people were able to access prescription drug replacements through special programs. In most instances, they had to get the medication from a pharmacy every day. For people using the highly potent opioid fentanyl or heroin on the street, doctors can provide the prescription opioid hydromorphone along with methadone. Dexedrine or Ritalin are  available to people who would otherwise be using cocaine or crystal meth. Days after the new guidelines were rolled out, Rupinder Brar, a physician at Vancouver’s Portland Hotel Society, said she has provided prescriptions for free drug replacements, which can be dispensed by the week. This gives her patients “a fighting chance” as supplies of illicit street drugs dwindle, along with sharply reduced opportunities to make income at a time of coronavirus shutdowns and social distancing measures. “I don’t want them to have to go to the pharmacy every day,” Brar said. Another option are specialized vending machines called MySafe. Conceived in response to the opioid crisis, they dispense drug replacements with a prescription, bypassing the need for a face-to-face interaction with a pharmacist. At the corner of Vancouver’s Main and Hastings streets, a typically busy intersection in a neighborhood where hawking pills is common, some sections of the sidewalk were virtually empty in early April. Chrissy McMullin, a Downtown Eastside resident who uses drugs, already takes opioid replacements and said she had no trouble getting a hydromorphone prescription under the new guidelines. McMullin, who lost her brother in October to an overdose, is upset it took a global pandemic to prompt access to safe drugs. “It’s a real kick in the gut, to see how quickly and easily (it got put in place),” McMullin said. “Now all of a sudden what we’ve been trying to get for years is made available.”",true,Health News
5,8602,"School closures will have little impact on COVID-19 control, review finds.","April 6, 2020","School closures do not tend to help contain the spread of infections during outbreaks of disease such as COVID-19, but will have a big impact on how societies restart after lockdown, scientists said on Monday.",Kate Kelland,"Data on the effects of school closures on COVID-19 are limited as the pandemic is still under way, but researchers at University College London said evidence from flu epidemics and outbreaks caused by other coronaviruses suggests their impact on the spread of the disease will be small. “We know from previous studies that school closures are likely to have the greatest effect if the virus has low transmissibility and attack rates are higher in children. This is the opposite of COVID-19,” said Russell Viner, an expert at UCL’s Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health who co-led the research. “Policymakers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19 given the profound and long lasting effect they will have on children - particularly the most disadvantaged,” he said. Millions of children around the world have been affected by school closures as governments introduced social distancing and lockdown measures to try to slow the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new SARS-COV2 coronavirus. Viner’s research, published late on Monday in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal, said that as of March 18, some 107 countries had implemented national schools closures. To analyze the potential impact, Viner’s team reviewed 16 previous studies, including nine which looked at school closures during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - a respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus similar to the one that causes COVID-19. Data from the SARS outbreak in China, Hong Kong and Singapore suggested school closures “did not contribute to control of the epidemic”, they said in a summary of the review. Experts not directly involved in the research said its findings were important and confirmed what many suspected: That the public health benefits of school closures were not proportionate to the social and economic costs for affected children and families. “This work suggests that ... schools could, and should, begin to reopen as soon as practicable after the initial wave of cases has passed through,” said Robert Dingwall, a professor of sociology at Britain’s Nottingham Trent University. Viner said the findings suggest countries should now “ask hard questions about when and how to open schools”. He said other measures, such as staggering school start and break times, closing school playgrounds and minimising the movement of children between classes could be considered to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading.",true,Health News
6,27556,"The state of Michigan threatened local beavers with a $10,000 per day fine for failing to remove their dams.","August 24, 2000","After some wrangling the agency ultimately dropped the issue, but not before Stephen Tvedten found an inventive way of quickly pointing out both how ludicrous and humorous the situation was. In a way dusty legal language never could, such a letter serves to drive home the silliness of Michigan DEQ’s intractable posturing. The beavers are likely still ignorant of how close they came to being fined $10,000 a day for dam living expenses.",David Mikkelson,"In July 1997, one of Stephen Tvedten’s neighbors noticed flooding on his property and traced it back to a dam on Tvedten’s stream. The neighbor complained to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) on 28 July 1997, and five months later the agency responded with a letter to the offending land owner. The letter, from David Price, a local Michigan DEQ official, was blunt: The “construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond” was “unauthorized” because “a permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.” The letter ordered Stephen Tvedten, the land owner, to “cease and desist” under penalty of “elevated enforcement action”:  STATE OF MICHIGAN Reply to: GRAND RAPIDS DISTRICT OFFICE STATE OFFICE BUILDING 6TH FLOOR 350 OTTAWA NW GRAND RAPIDS MI 49503-2341 JOHN ENGLER, Governor DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY HOLLISTER BUILDING, PO BOX 30473, LANSING MI 48909-7973 INTERNET: http://www.deq.state.mi RUSSELL J. HARDING, Director  December 17, 1997  CERTIFIED  Mr. Ryan DeVries 2088 Dagget Pierson, MI 49339  Dear Mr. DeVries:  SUBJECT: DEQ File No. 97-59-0023-1 T11N, R10W, Sec. 20, Montcalm County  It has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental Quality that there has been recent unauthorized activity on the above referenced parcel of property. You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor who did the following unauthorized activity:  Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond. A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity. A review of the Department’s files show that no permits have been issued. Therefore, the Department has determined that this activity is in violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws annotated. The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially failed during a recent rain event, causing debris dams and flooding at downstream locations. We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and cannot be permitted. The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist all unauthorized activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the strewn channel. All restoration work shall be completed no later than January 31, 1998. Please notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by our staff. Failure to comply with this request, or any further unauthorized activity on the site, may result in this case being referred for elevated enforcement action. We anticipate and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter. Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions. Sincerely,  David L. Price District Representative Land and Water Management Division  Mr. Tvedten responded to the Michigan DEQ’s demand with the now widely-circulated “dam letter,” in which he pointed out that the “debris dams” he had been ordered to remove because they were constructed without permission from the state of Michigan were actually built by beavers:  Dear Mr. Price: Re: DEQ File No. 97-59-0023; T11N, R10W, Sec 20; Montcalm County  Your certified letter dated 12/17/97 has been handed to me to respond to. You sent out a great deal of carbon copies to a lot of people, but you neglected to include their addresses. You will, therefore, have to send them a copy of my response. First of all, Mr. Ryan DeVries is not the legal landowner and/or contractor at 2088 Dagget, Pierson, Michigan — I am the legal owner and a couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of constructing and maintaining two wood “debris” dams across the outlet stream of my Spring Pond. While I did not pay for, nor authorize, their dam project, I think they would be highly offended you call their skillful use of natural building materials “debris.” I would like to challenge you to attempt to emulate their dam project any dam time and/or any dam place you choose. I believe I can safely state there is no dam way you could ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity, their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic. As to your dam request the beavers first must fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity, my first dam question to you is: are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers or do you require all dam beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam request? If you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, please send me completed copies of all those other applicable beaver dam permits. Perhaps we will see if there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws annotated. My first concern is — aren’t the dam beavers entitled to dam legal representation? The Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute and are unable to pay for said dam representation — so the State will have to provide them with a dam lawyer. The Department’s dam concern that either one or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event causing dam flooding is proof we should leave the dam Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than harassing them and calling them dam names. If you want the dam stream “restored” to a dam free-flow condition — contact the dam beavers — but if you are going to arrest them (they obviously did not pay any dam attention to your dam letter-being unable to read English) — be sure you read them their dam Miranda rights first. As for me, I am not going to cause more dam flooding or dam debris jams by interfering with these dam builders. If you want to hurt these dam beavers — be aware I am sending a copy of your dam letter and this response to PETA. If your dam Department seriously finds all dams of this nature inherently hazardous and truly will not permit their existence in this dam State — I seriously hope you are not selectively enforcing this dam policy, or once again both I and the Spring Pond Beavers will scream prejudice! In my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their dam unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green, and water flows downstream. They have more dam right than I to live and enjoy Spring Pond. So, as far as I and the beavers are concerned, this dam case can be referred for more dam elevated enforcement action now. Why wait until 1/31/98? The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then, and there will be no dam way for you or your dam staff to contact/harass them then. In conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention a real environmental quality (health) problem: bears are actually defecating in our woods. I definitely believe you should be persecuting the defecating bears and leave the dam beavers alone. If you are going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step! (The bears are not careful where they dump!) Being unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you on your dam answering machine, I am sending this response to your dam office. Sincerely, Stephen L. Tvedten  The DEQ later claimed they were fully aware the “debris dams” were beaver dams; the issue, they said, was that the beavers who built them had long since abandoned the dams, but Mr. Tvedten had been continuing to maintain and even build up the dams himself:  The letter concerned an enforcement action directed to a tenant on property surrounding Spring Pond, which is located in Pierson Township, Montcalm County, Michigan. The tenant was observed by the downstream complainant, and has since admitted to the complainant, that he artificially built up, and maintained two abandoned beaver dams on the discharge end of the natural pond. Such an activity falls under the jurisdiction of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 1194 PA 451, as amended. It is the Department’s position that in the absence of any threat to public welfare, beaver dams should be left in their natural state, that being either actively maintained or abandoned by beaver. The Department conducted an on-site inspection of the dams in August of 1997, accompanied by a Department of Natural Resources fisheries biologist, the Pierson Township Supervisor and the complainant. The tenant’s actions, and a threat to the welfare of the downstream complainant prompted our correspondence of December 1997, instructing the tenant to cease and desist all illegal activity and to restore the stream to its prior condition. The owner of the property took issue with our action, and responded with his own version of the situation. It was this correspondence that has been circulating in the internet. Luis Saldivia Grand Rapids District Supervisor Land and Water Management Division 616-356-0208  For his part, Mr. Tvedten claimed that the dams had been “abandoned” because a neighbor had killed the beavers (then filed a complaint with the state because he was concerned that the untended dams would break apart and enter his property) and that no one but the beavers had ever maintained them. And contemporaneous accounts of the brouhaha quoted a Michigan DEQ spokesman as saying the agency hadn’t performed an inspection before firing off their December 1997 letter to Mr. Tvedten:  Ken Silfven, public information officer at the state Department of Environmental Quality, said that … the account was correct. He hastened to note, however, that the case was prompted by a complaint from a neighbor who was concerned about flooding caused by the dams. The department dropped its investigation after an inspection by a DEQ employee. “It probably would have been a good idea to do the inspection before we sent the notice,” Silfven said.",true,"Humor, Loony Letters"
7,2830,More infected in fresh wave of China bird flu - WHO.,"January 20, 2014","Another 23 people in China have been infected with the H7N9 strain of bird flu in recent days, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday, adding to at least 24 new cases last week and confirming a fresh surge in the virus.",Kate Kelland,"With many people travelling within the country for upcoming Chinese New Year celebrations on January 31, the United Nations health agency also said people should be aware of the risk that flu viruses might spread more widely. Among the new H7N9 cases, reported from several different provinces of China, was a 38-year-old man who died on January 9 and a five year-old girl from Guangdong province who became ill on January 14 and is now stable in hospital. Many of the other new patients were either in a serious or critical condition in hospitals. Several had reported recent exposure to poultry or poultry markets, but the WHO said the source of infections was still under investigation. “Given the population movement prior to Chinese New Year and potentially unpredictable behavior of influenza viruses, continued vigilance and close monitoring are needed,” the WHO’s China office said in a statement on its website. It advised people “to continue to practice good hygiene and handle food properly” but did not recommend any travel or trade restrictions. The H7N9 bird flu virus emerged in March last year and has so far infected at least 199 people in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, killing 52 of them, according to an update on Monday from the WHO’s spokesman Gregory Hartl. Several clusters of cases in people who had close contact with an infected person have been reported in China, but WHO reiterated on Monday that “so far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission”. Hartl told Reuters last week that the United Nations health agency had noted the recent rapid increase in human H7N9 infections and was keeping a watchful eye. “So far we haven’t seen anything that causes us to change our risk assessment,” he said. The WHO’s assessment is that “the current likelihood of community-level spread ... is considered to be low.”  Experts say the Northern Hemisphere’s winter flu season is probably largely to blame for a significant increase in the number of cases of human H7N9 infection in recent weeks after they dwindled to almost nothing in July and August of 2013. “This trend is expected to continue through the winter months,” said the WHO’s China office. Experts have warned public health authorities and doctors to be on alert for any signals that the more widely circulating virus might be adapting or mutating to become easily transmissible between people.",true,Health News

A: No. That practice is illegal across the U.S.,Saranac Hale Spencer,"Q: Did Democrats in Maine legalize female genital mutilation? A: No. That practice is illegal across the U.S. Female genital mutilation has been outlawed across the country since 1996. It is not legal in any U.S. state.But, an incendiary headline has been circulating on Facebook claiming: “Maine House Democrats Vote to Allow Female Genital Mutilation.”Facebook users flagged it as potentially false. It is.The underlying story is based on a recent vote in the Maine legislature, which was considering a bill that would have criminalized the practice under state law in addition to the existing federal law.The Senate and the House of Representatives in Maine failed to agree on the text of the bill, and the measure died at the end of the session on April 18. The failure of the bill, however, doesn’t mean that Maine will now “allow female genital mutilation,” as the headline claimed.Debate over the bill had been highly charged for months. The Southern Poverty Law Center published emails in February between one Republican representative and a group called ACT for America, which the SPLC has designated as hate group.ACT for America has “helped pass” female genital mutilation legislation in nine states, according to the group’s website. It has also “helped pass” legislation that bans Sharia Law and legislation that “protect those who ‘see something’ and ‘say something,'” according to its website.The American Civil Liberties Union also had weighed in on an early version of the bill in Maine, saying in a statement, “This bill is nothing more than an attempt to single out behavior that is commonly attributed to certain religious and ethnic communities as different from other forms of abuse.” The ACLU called the bill “redundant,” because “there are already severe penalties under both Maine and federal law that cover FGM.”According to a women’s advocacy group called Equality Now, there were 26 states as of September 2017 that had enacted legislation criminalizing female genital mutilation in addition to the federal ban. Those laws differ in a number of ways, including the age-range they cover and the allowance for culture as defense.Editor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.18 U.S. Code Section 116 — Female genital mutilation.

18,15716,Wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the (NSA) database.,"April 9, 2015","Snowden said, ""Even if you sent it to someone within the United States, your wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the database."" In Oliver’s context of a naked picture, the comment may be surprising. But to experts familiar with the laws governing surveillance practices and the NSA programs brought to light through his leaks, Snowden is correct that this could happen. But this isn’t the most likely scenario for most Americans emailing other Americans day-in, day-out. Moreover, the NSA is supposed to ""minimize"" domestic emails that get caught up in a broader sweep, either by deleting them or not searching or using the information. Snowden’s claim is accurate but misses that context.",Katie Sanders,"Most Americans have a fuzzy understanding of exactly what the National Security Agency can and cannot see with its surveillance programs, much less what a former NSA contractor named Edward Snowden tried to do about it. That’s the finding, anyway, of informal street interviews by John Oliver’s crew at Last Week Tonight on HBO. Oliver devoted his April 5 show to the NSA spying story. It included an exclusive interview with Snowden, who is living in Russia after the State Department canceled his passport. And it included the topic of this fact-check: Can emails sent between two people living in the United States unwittingly end up on the computer screen of some NSA analyst? Oliver, who blends comedy with journalism, framed the discussion around the NSA peeping on nude pictures. Oliver asked Snowden to describe the capability of various NSA surveillance programs in relation to nude pictures sent by Americans, starting with ""702 surveillance."" This refers to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. This section was added in 2008 and was renewed under President Barack Obama in 2012. Could the NSA see a picture of, say, Oliver’s privates under this provision, he asked? ""Yes,"" Snowden said, ""the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which section 702 falls under, allows the bulk collection of internet communications that are one-end foreign."" After an Oliver joke about ""bulk collection,"" Snowden continued, ""So if you have your email somewhere like Gmail, hosted on a server overseas or transferred overseas or anytime crosses outside the borders of the United States, your junk ends up in the database."" Oliver jumped in and asked Snowden to clarify that the racy picture — if you’ve seen the interview, you know we’re paraphrasing — wouldn’t necessarily have to be sent to Germany in order to end up in NSA storage. ""No,"" Snowden said. ""Even if you sent it to someone within the United States, your wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the database."" Is it really true that this situation (regardless of the content of the email) could happen, and if so, is it likely? You’ve got mail … being collected by the NSA Several experts in national security law agreed Snowden’s scenario is plausible, thanks to holes in international surveillance laws that affect data shared between Americans living in America. The law that Oliver mentioned, Section 702 of FISA Amendments Act of 2008, is labeled ""Procedures For Targeting Certain Persons Outside The United States Other Than United States Persons."" Going on name alone, that sounds like the opposite of a license for the NSA to collect private messages between Americans. Not necessarily. The section addresses spying on communications on U.S. soil in which one end of the conversation is foreign. Critics, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Center for Technology and Democracy, and American Civil Liberties Union, deem it a ""backdoor search loophole"" that allows the NSA to get access to information on U.S. citizens. The section says the government cannot ""intentionally target"" citizens of the United States with its surveillance, nor can it target a person outside the country to learn more about the communications of a person who is in the United States. ""Intentionally,"" obviously, is a pretty big gap. NSA communications spying under Section 702 does not need an individual warrant. There are a few government spying programs that we know about, through Snowden’s leaks to journalists, that operate using Section 702, including Prism and Upstream. Prism, as outlined in a leaked slide, allows the NSA to collect via court order email, chats, videos, photos, stored data and files of foreign targets from technology companies such as Google, Apple, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook. Analysts reportedly use Prism in concert with Upstream, by which the NSA collects foreigners’ communications directly from the fiber-optic backbone of the Internet. A leaked NSA slide reported by the Washington Post describes Upstream as amassing ""communications on fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past."" Through those spying programs, it is possible that American-to-American email could hit an overseas server and be pulled into NSA databases even though those emails are not the target of NSA searches. The law does not prohibit this kind of ""incidental"" collection of Americans’ communications, as long as it was part of an otherwise valid collection of non-Americans’ information, said Stephen Vladeck, American University national security law professor. Government reports, leaks and a scathing 2011 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinion offer more proof that the NSA cannot separate out communications between Americans from the emails involving a foreigner. ""NSA’s knowing acquisition of tens of thousands of wholly domestic communications through its Upstream collection is a cause of concern for the court,"" wrote FISC Judge John D. Bates in the declassified opinion. It’s unknown exactly how often this happens, but it does not appear unusual. ""It doesn’t matter whether it’s a d--- pic or a bland email,"" said Andrew Crocker, a senior analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which sued the NSA to release the Bates opinion. ""These are all things that can be swept up."" By law, the NSA is supposed to ""minimize"" wholly domestic communications it obtains, said Molly Bishop Shadel, a University of Virginia law professor who represented the United States on terrorism-related matters before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court while working for the Justice Department. This could mean deleting the email or not searching or using the information, something Snowden doesn’t say. ""I can’t promise the email wouldn’t end up in an NSA database,"" she said, ""but it’s not going to be accessible to the government if it does."" Other experts pointed out that we don’t know for sure what happens to these exchanges when they are collected. Jonathan Mayer, a cybersecurity fellow at Stanford University’s Center for Internet and Society, said many important features of Upstream collection ""haven’t leaked and remain classified,"" such as whether it involves bulk collection, massive-but-targeted collection or only individually targeted collection, he said. Email routes that cross international boundaries So, yes, it’s possible that an email between you and your wife or husband about the grocery list could wind up in the hands of the NSA. But to do so, the electronic footprint of that email needs to leave the confines of the United States. How likely is that to happen? Understanding how or why an email may hit an overseas server even if it’s sent to someone in the same area requires a basic knowledge of how the Internet works. But even then, it’s complicated. So we turned to technologists, who had different opinions. Predicting how an email travels to its destination once you hit ""send"" is not an exact science — and it can change from hour to hour. When a person sends an email, it goes through the Internet service provider to an email provider, is exchanged with another provider, and goes back to someone else’s Internet service provider. If the Internet provider is big, like Verizon, the most efficient, least congested path to route the bits of information might just be a cable that crosses a foreign country’s boundary. Chats, pictures and messages travel from senders to recipients through the Internet along fiber-optic cables, some underground and some undersea. These cables can send messages in milliseconds. ""The way the network thinks about distance is very different from the way you think about distance in the real physical world,"" said Joseph Hall, Center for Democracy and Technology chief technologist. Hall mentioned an example using the concept of ""trombone routing:"" Two people could be on opposite sides of Denver, and the most efficient way to get bits of information to them may be through a cable that runs through Canada. Mayer, of Stanford University, suggested the odds are good that your message is stored domestically if you’re an American who is working within the continental United States and who is using Gmail. Mayer called Snowden’s example of an intimate picture shared between a couple in New York hitting a London server en route to its destination ""hypothetically possible, but it’s unlikely."" The route between providers would have to be unusual, and the connection would have to be unencrypted, he said. ""There are enormous privacy implications from the one-end foreign rule, to be clear,"" Mayer said. ""I just don’t think this is a very generalizable example."" On the other hand, Hall said, ""It’s not hard to see this happening at all,"" even though more providers are encrypting their networks in response to NSA practices. Even though Hall and Mayer have different estimations for how likely it is for a U.S. user’s communications to be transmitted over a national border at a given time, Hall agrees it’s more likely for an email to cross a border in places that don’t have a huge infrastructure. Because Snowden mentioned Google’s Gmail service as an example, we checked in with the company to figure out under which conditions this example could happen. The company has strengthened the encryption of its infrastructure as a way to dissuade the government from using ""backdoor"" methods of tapping its network data without its knowledge. Emails between Gmail accounts are encrypted as they go to Gmail servers, which essentially means they look like gibberish to outsiders, and as they move from Google’s data centers around the country and the world. Copies of emails could be stored in several places, including in data centers abroad, as a way to provide backups in case one center fails. If the NSA tried to collect emails between Google data centers, they may be able to pull the metadata of messages (the to and from) but not the content. If one side of the exchange is not a Gmail user, the message may not be encrypted and therefore may be more vulnerable. As for how often an email may end up in a foreign server, even if it’s between two American Gmail users, spokesman Aaron Stein said, ""We aren't always able to predict how often that happens."" The NSA press office did not return requests for comment. Our ruling Snowden said, ""Even if you sent it to someone within the United States, your wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the database."" In Oliver’s context of a naked picture, the comment may be surprising. But to experts familiar with the laws governing surveillance practices and the NSA programs brought to light through his leaks, Snowden is correct that this could happen. But this isn’t the most likely scenario for most Americans emailing other Americans day-in, day-out. Moreover, the NSA is supposed to ""minimize"" domestic emails that get caught up in a broader sweep, either by deleting them or not searching or using the information. Snowden’s claim is accurate but misses that context. We rate it .",true,"Homeland Security, Technology, Terrorism, PunditFact, Edward Snowden, "
20,8645,Italy looks to safeguard biomedical valley leading fight against COVID-19.,"April 3, 2020",Italy plans to tighten health checks to ensure that work is not disrupted in a small northern town specialising in the production of medical supplies to tackle its coronavirus crisis.,Stephen Jewkes,"The area snuggled around the medieval town of Mirandola has become a focus for desperate health authorities seeking to source equipment in the European country where COVID-19 has taken the most deadly toll. Already home to a cluster of companies making high-end products for dialysis, heart surgery and transfusions, it has found itself on the front line of efforts to treat patients during the pandemic. “This is a key strategic sector that we need to nurture and we’re going to make sure it stays open for business,” said Sergio Venturi, coronavirus czar for the northern region of Emilia Romagna where Mirandola is located. The idea is to ask companies to carry out swab tests on their employees to help monitor the health of workers in an area deemed of national strategic interest. Faster tests being developed in a nearby laboratory could also come into play once validated. “What we’re looking to do is ask for daily screening for all staff in the area so there’s no risk of the virus leading to a shutdown. We can’t afford that,” Venturi told Reuters. The measures underline the importance of the hub, created around 50 years ago by the pharmacist and entrepreneur Mario Veronesi. Mirandola, which has a population of only around 24,000,   plays host to about 100 high-tech medical companies including Germany’s Fresenius SE (FREG.DE), ventilator multinational Medtronic (MDT.N), and UK respiratory support group Intersurgical. Companies have been working flat out on coronavirus-related production such as filters and circuits to help supply oxygen, and disposable medical items to hook patients up to ventilators. Production in the area, badly damaged in a deadly earthquake eight years ago, has shot up by more than 20%. Dimar, one of a handful of companies producing respiratory helmets, had police and staff from Italy’s Civil Protection unit knocking on its doors to take stock back to neighbouring Lombardy, one of Italy’s worst affected regions. The company, which supplies emergency departments in around 125 hospitals, has ratcheted up output of its face-covering helmets that allow patients to be treated away from overwhelmed intensive care units. “We wanted to double production but it’s just not possible since that would require building plant and that takes more than six months,” Dimar founder Maurizio Borsari said, adding that problems faced by suppliers, transport bottlenecks and a shortage of raw materials was also holding up work. Borsari said police patrols in the district had risen sharply since the crisis started to protect businesses. A dearth of equipment such as surgical masks and ventilators has left hospitals and medical staff across the north struggling to cope, and concern is growing the spread of the virus to the poorer south could cause some health systems there to collapse. It was another Mirandola company, UK-based Intersurgical, that in 72 hours last month built a prototype circuit developed by an Italian medical team allowing two patients to use the same ventilator – effectively doubling capacity at a stroke. Giuliana Gavioli, regulatory director at German dialysis and blood product group B. Braun, points to the role of local expertise in underpinning broader efforts to fight COVID-19. “They’re giving special status to this district because of its biomed pedigree and they want to get a task force in place to move on a series of fronts such as identifying product lines that can be converted to produce vital equipment and medical devices,” she said. She points to the example of recent start-up Tecnopolo, which has around 20 researchers. Set up in 2015 to provide biotech research services, it now concentrates on certifying the masks made by a legion of companies around the country that have switched from other product lines such as fashion. “Work has ballooned. We’re in contact with around 250 companies across the country that want their production lines authorised,” says Tecnopolo coordinator Laura Aldrovandi.",true,Health News

What's false: The number WO2020060606A1 contains three ""6's"" but is obviously not the same as ""666."" This patent focuses on tracking body activity via wearable technology, such as a smart watch, and makes no mention of implanted microchips.",Dan Evon,"The spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease in 2020 sparked a flurry of conspiracy theories concerning where it originated, how it spread, and who was responsible for it. One such theory blamed the disease on Bill Gates and claimed that the former Microsoft CEO had started a pandemic so that he could insert microchips into people around the globe under the guise of providing vaccinations or for other purposes. This conspiracy theory is propped up by little more than coincidences and misinterpretations. For instance, in April 2020 social media users started to share a link to a patent supposedly owned by Microsoft that pertained to the micro-chipping of individuals for financial gain. This patent was especially insidious, users claimed, because it carried the numbers “666,” the biblical mark of the devil, and the letters WO, which they claimed stood for the “World Order.”    The above-displayed screenshots pertain to a genuine patent filed by Microsoft. However, this patent does not involve a plan to microchip individuals, “WO” does not stand for World Order, and one has to ignore the existence of 11 other characters in order to arrive at the conclusion that this patent carries the devil’s number. This patent is for a “cryptocurrency system” that “uses body activity data.” Microsoft Technology Licensing applied for this patent in June 2019, and the patent was published a few months later in March 2020 under the number “WO2020060606A1.”  The patent, which has not been granted as of this writing, makes no mention of microchips. The diagrams included in this patent (and shown in the screenshots above) show how the “person,” “user device,” and “sensor” are all distinct items. The text of the patent further explains that the “user device” in the diagram may include wearables, such as a smart watch, or cell phones, laptops, or tablets: User device 130 may include any device capable of processing and storing data/information and communicating over communication network 120. For example, user device 130 may include personal computers, servers, cell phones, tablets, laptops, smart devices (e.g. smart watches or smart televisions). An exemplary embodiment of user device 130 is illustrated in FIG. 6. The patent provides two options for the sensor. First, the sensor could be incorporated into one of the aforementioned devices, such as a smartphone. The “sensor” may also be its own standalone component: Sensor 140 may be configured to sense the body activity of user 145. As illustrated in FIG. 1, sensor 140 may be a separate component from user device 130 and be operably and/or communicatively connected to user device 130. Alternatively, sensor 140 may be included and integrated in user device 130. For example, user device 130 may be a wearable device having sensor 140 therein. The sensor 140 may transmit information/data to user device 130. At no point in this patent does Microsoft suggest that the sensor would be a microchip implanted into a person’s skin.",false,"Technology, COVID-19"
23,31207,Chumlee from 'Pawn Stars' has passed away.,"June 3, 2013",Reports that the 'Pawn Stars' personality has passed away are a hoax.,David Mikkelson,"Austin “Chumlee” Russell (so nicknamed by a friend’s father due to his resemblance to the character of Chumley the walrus in the Tennessee Tuxedo cartoons) is one of the stars of the popular reality show Pawn Stars, the “resident clown” of the staff at the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas, where he is frequently derided by the shop’s owners, Rick Harrison and Richard “Old Man” Harrison, for being bumbling and lazy. Beginning in May 2013, a rumor was circulated on the Internet claiming that Chumlee had recently passed away from a “marijuana overdose”: In what may come to be a medical landmark, “Chumlee” Russell of Pawn Stars fame died from a marijuana overdose Monday night and was found by friend “Big Hoss” Harrison on Tuesday morning. Earlier this year, “Chumlee” was arrested with seven pounds of marijuana which he asserted were all for personal use. According to Dr. Angstrom H. Troubador, “The only possible way he could have died from a marijuana overdose without first clogging his lungs with soot is through the use of vaporizers. Reportedly, Chumlee had rigged up to 90 vaporizers into one tube and had a team of groupies constantly loading them up with the stickiest and most potent of marijuana available on the market.” Fans and family mourn the loss of “Chumlee” and have taken the opportunity to speak out against drug abuse. “To die like that, it’s just a shame,” said Rick Harrison, manager of the world famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop, as he teared up. “It’s just a shame to lose such a fun guy as Chum. Rest in peace, buddy.”  The rumor was nothing more than a hoax, a bit of fiction promulgated in a 14 May 2013 article published on the Internet Chronicle web site, one which followed up that site’s equally fictitious report from two months earlier which claimed Chumlee had been arrested for possession of seven pounds of marijuana. (The putative cause of death given in Chumlee’s phony Internet Chronicle obituary, a “marijuana overdose,” is virtually a medical impossibility.) In March 2014, a similar spoof article published by eBuzzd (along with images of fake reaction tweets from other celebrities) spawned more false Chumlee death rumors, this time positing that the Pawn Stars personality had passed away of a heart attack: Austin Russell, also known as Chumlee, star of History’s reality series “Pawn Stars,” has died from an apparent heart attack, sources confirm to eBuzzd. He was only 31 years old. The news comes as a shock considering Chumlee’s [sic] had just recently altered his lifestyle habits, and lost 75 pounds in a year by exercising at a gym six days a week and improving his diet, including drinking more juice, eating more vegetables and abstaining from red meat, a change that was inspired by his father’s death at age 54 from pancreatic cancer, two weeks before Pawn Stars debuted. In July 2017, business2community.com revived the “marijuana overdose” death hoax:  Austin “Chumlee” Russell from “Pawn Stars” being found dead from a marijuana overdose or heart attack is a celebrity death hoax. There is no truths that the TV personality has passed away. Russell is one of the stars of the popular reality show and is just like a son to Rick Harrison. He has been around the shop since he was a kid. Everybody loves Chum, but he is often the “resident clown.” Part of the reason he is not taken seriously is that he constantly begs Corey Harrison to buy items that entertain him like video games and circus paraphernalia that usually do not make good business sense. The real Chumlee remains alive and well, as indicated by his ongoing tweets and his appearances at his  candy store in Las Vegas: Buy some candies for @somahe80 at Chumlee's candies shop.

There are areas where Heck and Trump overlap on immigration policy: mandatory E-verify for employers, upping border security and questioning birthright citizenship. However, Cortez Masto made it sound like Heck and Trump are lockstep on the issue, and that's clearly not the case. There are major stated policy differences between the two Republicans — Heck opposes mass deportation, which Trump campaigned on during the primary season. And Heck has supported a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country, as well as supported a version of the DREAM Act. It wasn't ""next to impossible"" to find those differences.",Riley Snyder,"National and state Democrats are trying to tie Nevada Republican Senate candidate Joe Heck to the controversial immigration policies of Donald Trump,including Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto. In a recent news release, Cortez Masto’s campaign called the two Republicans ""ideological soul mates."" ""Just on the issue of immigration alone, it is next to impossible to find a policy difference between Trump and Congressman Heck,"" stated Cortez Masto’s release. With immigration being a top concern for Nevada’s sizable Hispanic population, we thought it was worth comparing the two candidates to see if it really is ""next to impossible"" to find a policy difference. Priorities On the surface level, there are many policy differences on immigration between Heck and Trump. Trump’s immigration platform is detailed on his campaign website, and centers around three topics previously distilled by PolitiFact: Build a border wall across the U.S.-Mexico border, and require Mexico to make a one-time $5 to $10 billion payment to pay for it. Increase enforcement of immigration laws, including ending birthright citizenship and ending funding for so-called sanctuary cities. Focus on American workers, including halting green cards for foreign workers until more domestic workers are hired and increasing the minimum prevailing wage for H-1B visa program recipients. Heck’s campaign and House websites acknowledge a ""broken"" immigration system but focus on different policy solutions. While echoing Trump in calling for implementing a mandatory E-verify system for employers and calling for increased border security, Heck says he’s open to granting citizenship or legal status to people not legally in the country if his other proposals are addressed in a ""meaningful"" way. Both campaigns sent lengthy responses to PolitiFact. One thing is clear: There is daylight between Heck and Trump on a number of immigration policies. Birthright citizenship Democrats claim Heck and Trump share identical positions on wanting to ""end birthright citizenship and repeal the 14th Amendment."" It’s true both Republicans have mentioned re-examining the concept of jus soli — extending citizenship based on place of birth, not parental nationality — but Heck and Trump differ on rhetoric. Trump explicitly calls for an end to the policy, calling it the ""biggest magnet for illegal immigration."" (He also cites Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid’s 1993 bill ""clarifying"" the concept, though Reid later called it the ""low point"" of his legislative career.) Heck has also called for a similar re-examination of the policy, but in a less direct tone. His most pointed comments came in 2012, where a tracker captured Heck saying he supported changing the concept. ""My personal opinion is that if you’re gonna be a citizen – be considered a citizen – you should be born to at least one parent that’s a U.S. citizen,"" he said at the time. Heck generally hasn’t gone as far since then, most recently telling a Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter that ""it needs to be part of the discussion"" but stopping short of a full endorsement. Legal scholars generally agree that birthright citizenship is on solid constitutional ground, but several believe it would only take a congressional act to ""clarify"" citizenship for children born of people not legally in the United States, and point out that the court has never fully adjudicated the issue. 2013 immigration bill Cortez Masto says Heck and Trump both opposed the 2013 bipartisan immigration legislation, commonly referred to as the ""Gang of Eight"" bill. That glosses over important parts of the story. In 2013, Heck described the legislation as having positives and negatives but ultimately said he’d vote against the Senate bill as written, pointing to concerns over border security and wanting to toughen the education requirements for the children of people not legally in the country looking to apply for citizenship. The bill never received a House vote, but Heck still took independent action on the immigration bill. The Republican worked on draft legislation providing a pathway to citizenship for people illegally brought into the country as children, and publicly criticized House leadership in 2013 for failing to vote on any immigration legislation. Trump, on the other hand, told Bloomberg that he only really started following the immigration debate since he started running for president in 2015. ""When I made my (announcement) speech at Trump Tower, the June 16 speech, I didn’t know about the Gang of Eight. … I just knew instinctively that our borders are a mess,"" he said in May. This is contradicted by several tweets and interviews Trump did in 2013, calling the legislation a ""death wish"" for the Republican Party. Trump later criticized primary rival Marco Rubio’s involvement in the legislation, calling it ""nothing more than a giveaway to the corporate patrons who run both parties."" DREAMers/DACA One of Heck’s most notable forays into the immigration debate was a failed attempt to bring forward a Republican version of the long-languishing Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act. Heck worked for around six months to try to find a compromise path supported by both parties, businesses and immigration activists before trying to roll out the measure in December 2013. Heck’s version of the legislation, which had a pathway to citizenship for immigrants brought unlawfully into the country as children, fell flat after immigration activists and several other stakeholders declined to back the proposal over concerns that it only addressed part of the problem and wanted to hold out for a more comprehensive immigration plan. Additionally, Heck has voted against funding for Obama’s executive orders allowing undocumented children and their parents to receive work permits and exemptions from deportation. He’s on the record voting for several amendments that would strip the program’s funding and voted in 2015 to block funding for an expansion of the program while joining with 25 other House Republicans to support the existing program. In the past, Heck has tried to frame his mixed voting record on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals in terms of his stated opposition to the president’s use of executive orders establishing the programs. Trump is clearly opposed to the issue, and in 2015 called for the full rescission of executive orders protecting DREAMers from deportation, as well as the mass deportation of the roughly 11 million people not legally in the country. He’s also publicly opposed the DREAM Act itself. Heck has routinely called Trump’s proposals unrealistic. ""I don’t think they can find, round up and afford to deport 11 million people,"" he told reporters in March. The wall/border security Heck also differs on Trump’s signature piece of immigration policy — building a massive border wall with Mexico. The Heck campaign provided PolitiFact with a form letter sent to constituents who ask about the proposed border wall. The letter stresses Heck’s commitment to border security while gently dismissing Trump’s plan for a massive, thousand-mile concrete wall as being inefficient. ""Physical barriers are certainly effective in areas with high cross-border traffic; however, there are vast stretches of our border that have relatively few crossings, and preventing these crossings could be more easily achieved through other methods,"" he says in the letter. Part of Heck’s stated reasoning for opposing the 2013 immigration bill had to do with border security — the Republican specifically called for additional border fencing and for more manpower along the border to stop illegal crossings. H1-B visas Trump and Heck also differ on what to do with temporary H1-B visas for skilled foreign workers. Trump’s plan explicitly calls to increase the minimum prevailing wage (an averaged wage paid to workers in a similar field) for H1-B recipients over fears that the program depresses wages for American workers. It also makes an unspecified point of forcing companies to hire American workers before foreign workers in the visa program. Heck’s campaign provided PolitiFact with a form letter sent to voters who ask about limiting the visas, which details Heck’s concerns that scaling back the program could hurt economic growth. ""By restricting H-1B visas, growth in the U.S. in STEM fields could be restricted,"" Heck says in the letter. Sanctuary cities Another area of immigration policy overlap for Trump and Heck is in defunding so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" or areas where local law enforcement doesn’t routinely report undocumented migrants to immigration authorities. There’s no agreed-upon or legal definition of a ""sanctuary city,"" and use of the moniker is somewhat fluid. Trump seized the issue after the shooting death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco last year by an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times, and has forcefully called for cutting off federal grants to cities that refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement. While he hasn’t been as vocal as Trump, Heck did vote to block federal law enforcement funds from sanctuary cities as part of a House bill in July 2015. The White House promised to veto the measure, which has defeated in a procedural vote by Senate Democrats. Our ruling Cortez Masto claims that ""on the issue of immigration alone, it is next to impossible to find a policy difference between (Donald) Trump and Congressman (Joe) Heck.""

26,37537,"The 1918 influenza pandemic was called the ""Spanish Flu"" because it emanated from Spain.","March 19, 2020",Chuck Grassley’s ‘Spanish Flu’ Tweet Adds to Wave of Xenophobic COVID-19 Rhetoric From GOP,  Arturo Garcia  ,"As United States President Donald Trump and his supporters continued to try to normalize xenophobic rhetoric surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa came under criticism online for his own effort.“I don’t understand why China gets upset [because] we refer to the virus that originated there [as] the ‘Chinese virus,'” he wrote on Twitter. “Spain never got upset when we referred to the Spanish flu in 1918 & 1919.”Grassley was hit with thousands of responses in a Twitter phenomenon commonly called “the ratio,” with many of the replies correcting him on the origin of the 1918 pandemic’s name.In reality, the “Spanish flu” — a strain of H1N1 influenza — was not first detected in Spain. As sources ranging from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to the Journal of Translational Medicine have identified the midwestern United States as the likely starting point for the disease. According to a 2004 study published in the journal:Haskell County, Kansas, is the first recorded instance anywhere in the world of an outbreak of influenza so unusual that a physician warned public health officials. It remains the first recorded instance suggesting that a new virus was adapting, violently, to man.If the virus did not originate in Haskell, there is no good explanation for how it arrived there. There were no other known outbreaks anywhere in the United States from which someone could have carried the disease to Haskell, and no suggestions of influenza outbreaks in either newspapers or reflected in vital statistics anywhere else in the region. And unlike the 1916 outbreak in France, one can trace with perfect definiteness the route of the virus from Haskell to the outside world.In February 2018, the The Wichita Eagle, the state’s largest newspaper, published a report commemorating the centennial of the outbreak:No one knows for sure what farm, what family may have first fallen ill. The community was most likely Santa Fe, now a ghost town in Haskell County, says Darlene Groth, curator at Haskell County Historical Society in Sublette.What is known is that a Kansas country doctor — Dr. Loring Miner, who practiced in Haskell County — became concerned when he noticed this three-day flu wasn’t typical. It was an “influenza of the severe type,” he wrote, and hit young, strong and otherwise healthy people the hardest. He was the first to report to Public Health Reports — a publication of the U.S. Public Health Service — that this flu was a killer.Furthermore, several reports have verified that the disease’s enduring nickname was derived from one of the few sources of coverage it received during World War I. According to a 2019 study published in the Journal of Preventive Medicine and Health, reports out of Spain were a function of its remarkably free press, relative to news organizations in other countries:As Spain was neutral in the First World War, newspapers there were free to report the devastating effects that the 1918 pandemic virus was having in that country. Thus, it was generally perceived that the pandemic had originated in Spain, and the infection was incorrectly dubbed “Spanish flu”. During the fall of 1918, the front pages of Spanish newspapers were filled with the names of those who had died of the pandemic in the country.In other European countries, however, the press refrained from reporting news of the spreading infection, in order to avoid alarming the general population, which was already suffering the privations caused by the First World War. On 22nd August 1918, the Italian Interior Minister denied the alarming reports of the spread of the flu pandemic, and in the following months, both national and international newspapers followed suit. Nor was censorship restricted to news of the spread of the fearsome infection; it also extended to information and comments that contrasted with the official versions of the nature of the disease.In order to avoid public alarm, several local hygiene authorities refused to reveal the numbers of people affected and deaths.Grassley’s tweet is part of a larger wave of xenophobic and racist remarks that right-wing politicians and outlets have churned out in an apparent attempt to blame China for the virus outright and change the national narrative, defying the process the World Health Organization went through in designating the disease behind the 2020 pandemic as COVID-19.“We had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease,” WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said according to the New York Times. “Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing.”The Sinophobic rhetoric has made its way to the White House Twitter account:But as CNN reported, the shift was sudden; Trump only began using this particular descriptor for COVID-19 on March 16th 2020:Trump only started calling the “Chinese Virus” within the last two days.Between January and March 15th, he referred to it as the “coronavirus”, at least on Twitter anyway, 41 times.Since March 16th he hasn’t called it the “coronavirus” once. pic.twitter.com/luucCArdjA— Nathan McDermott (@natemcdermott) March 18, 2020As often happens, the political demonization dovetails with public discrimination.

29,27765,"Getting your hair washed at a beauty salon can, in rare cases, increase the chances of a stroke.","March 25, 2016","Just don’t bend your neck back, literally, at all. It can be something as simple as saying, “put five or six towels down.” Don’t bend your neck back, no matter how comfortable you are, or what your stylist says.",Brooke Binkowski,"In January 2014, a woman in San Diego, California, went to a local salon to get her hair done. What happened next sounds like the most nightmarish of urban legends: the angle and degree she was tilted in the chair and the way her head tipped back over the sink while the stylist was washing her hair caused Elizabeth Smith to have a stroke two weeks later: “I vomited, my head became hot and I couldn’t stand. I had weakness in my arms and legs. They didn’t think I was going to live,” said Smith, choking back tears. Smith says she could hardly believe what nearly killed her. Her doctors pointed to her time in the shampoo chair. Beauty Parlor Stroke Syndrome is what they called it. It’s a rare but documented condition. Multiple doctors who saw Smith say when her neck was bent backwards, it hyperextended, her vertebrae slicing an artery. A clot began forming, later causing a stroke. “Several of Ms. Smith’s neurologists confirmed with her that the stroke was caused by the vertebra dissecting her artery during her hair wash,” said Smith’s attorney Carree Nahama. The danger is real, although the probability of it happening is low. A study that came out in 1993, subsequently covered by the New York Times, found that older people have a higher risk of a stroke during or after a visit to the beauty salon (Smith was in her late 40s at the time): The patients suffered from a variety of complaints attributable to poor blood flow in arteries leading through the neck to the back of the brain, including severe dizziness, imbalance and facial numbness. Four out of five suffered strokes leading to permanent neurologic damage. “In older people, neck motion beyond a certain degree can be extremely dangerous, particularly hyperextension and rotation,” said Dr. Weintraub, chief of neurology at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y., referring to backward arching and twisting. He and others have suggested that patients receiving anesthesia or undergoing prolonged dental work may also be vulnerable, since they too have their necks arched back abnormally for prolonged periods. A 2006 study also looked into the issue, saying while it probably occurred more than previously thought, the risk of stroke in these cases was easily alleviated: Taken together, hyperextension combined with hanging the head backwards in a hair washbasin can be seen as a risk factor for posterior circulation ischemia. It probably occurs more often than assumed and a number of patients may report about previous dizziness episodes under the same conditions when asked specifically. It can be prevented by changing the shampoo routine from the hanging head position to a flexed or neutral position. Dr. Scott Olson, a vascular neurologist at the University of California, San Diego, told us that while he hasn’t seen this specific case, he has seen this particular injury (more commonly called a “vertebral artery dissection,” which can lead to subsequent clotting and stroke) and it’s not unprecedented: It’s pretty much a fluke. I have seen people who’ve had this happen while surfing, they happen after dental visits. I had an auto mechanic who was working on a car for a day and had his head hanging over a creeper… I had a patient fall asleep in a movie theater and ended up having a dissection. [But] …It’s like a lot of things in life where it’s the same thing you’ve done. I think people should not be inordinately worried about it. I mean, tens of thousands of people across this country have their hair washed at salons every day. It’s very statistically uncommon. He says there are signs to watch for after a potential injury: Things people should pay attention to, should be concerned about? Pain on one side of the neck after extension, and obviously, any neurologic symptoms like vertigo. There’s some genetic disorders, like Marfan Syndrome, hyperextensible joints, or connective tissue disease that will make you more prone. Elizabeth Smith says she racked up $250,000 in medical bills and has permanently lost part of her vision and mobility. She is now suing the salon for damages. On 30 March 2016, we spoke to Smith. She told us: I had no idea that the story would go on, and I’m glad that it has. The two big skepticisms really are — people think that you feel something, but you feel nothing, because your artery has no nerves, so you feel nothing when it happens. So just because you’re like “oh, I’m comfortable,” doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened. The other thing is that the delay from injury to stroke is because you get a little bit of a bleed, and a little bleed won’t clog or occlude your artery. It takes your body time to build a clot big enough to do the damage, roughly two weeks. For me, it was 8 days, but that wasn’t the full stroke.",true,"Uncategorized, beauty parlor stroke syndrome, salon, stroke"

Wynn did not offer nor did we find data specific to individual cities. But four major metro areas, led by Washington, D.C., netted more new residents in the cited age group in the latest three years checked by Brookings demographer James Frey. The Austin area ranked fifth among the nation’s major metros. We see no basis for currently declaring Austin No. 1, but Wynn's claim has an element of truth; the Austin area was the biggest draw for young adults in some recent three-year periods.",W. Gardner Selby,"Former Austin Mayor Will Wynn, who often speaks on urban growth, suggested that Austin’s attractiveness to retirees and young Americans helps explain demand for downtown housing. ""As our society ages, and as boomers start retiring by the millions, we’re going to see a dramatic increase in the demand for dense urban multifamily housing, with a broad mix of uses nearby,"" Wynn told the Austin American-Statesman for a March 30, 2014, news story headlined ""Austin’s rebuilding boom."" ""Couple that with the fact that more 25- to 34-year-olds are moving to Austin than any other city in America,"" Wynn said, ""and you’ve got yourself a hell of a strong demand for urban housing. I tell people that by any way you possibly measure it — quality of life, public safety, environmental sustainability, public health and fitness, economic — mixed-use density is literally the answer."" Density preferences aside, is Wynn right that more young adults are moving to Austin than to any other U.S. city? Wynn recalls a newspaper story By phone and email, Wynn said he learned of Austin’s draw from a Statesman news story citing U.S Census Bureau research. He didn’t have the story handy, but we found a March 30, 2013, Statesman news story stating that analyses of U.S Census Bureau data by William Frey, a senior demographer at the Brookings Institution, found that from 2009 through 2011, the Austin metro area drew more Americans in the cited age span than any other U.S. city--just as the area did the previous three years, the story said. Frey, the newspaper said, measured rates for annual average net migration (including people who left Austin) of young adults ages 25 to 34 and young adults with college degrees. ""Austin hits the trifecta,"" Frey said then. ""It's got jobs, cachet, it's got people who see that it's a pathway to careers, either because they go there to get an education or to use an education."" Frey further said jobs typically are the top reason people move. Twenty-somethings traditionally have the highest rates of mobility, and college graduates typically are more willing to move out of state for jobs because they tend to compete for them in national markets, Frey said then. Updated analysis places Austin-Round Rock fifth But there's been a change in the rankings, according to Frey’s Nov. 15, 2013, analysis of more recent census data. The Austin-Round Rock metro area placed fifth among 51 major metro areas as a draw on ""millennials,"" adults in the cited age group, from 2009 through 2012, according to a chart posted online by Brookings. Over those three years, the Austin-Round Rock area had an average annual gain of 8,061 25- to 34-year-olds, Frey wrote. Washington, D.C., ranked first among major metro areas with an average annual gain of 12,583 people in the age group, he wrote. Also, the Denver, Portland, Ore., and Houston areas netted greater gains than the Austin area, according to Frey’s breakdown. On the Brookings site, Frey described the D.C. results as a ""renewal of young adults in the post-recession period… compared to the loss of young adults during the recession. The existence of both government and non-government employment opportunities in a highly educated ‘millennial friendly’ environment make the nation’s capital an attractive destination until migration flows to a broader group of areas emerge. ""A few other areas, including San Francisco and Minneapolis, have showed a rising post-recession young adult boom as well,"" Frey wrote. His chart shows the San Francisco area ranked sixth among major metro areas with an average annual gain of 7,688 such young adults in the three years. The Minneapolis area, 11th among major metros, had an average annual gain of 3,708 adults in the age group, according to the chart. Researcher says No. 5 isn't so bad To our inquiry, Frey said by email that while Austin’s rank fell between the cited time periods, there is another way to compare--by the rate of change in such adults settling in major metro areas. By that measure, Frey added, the Austin-Round Rock area’s 2.7 net gain per 100 25- to 34-year-olds placed it second among major metros only to the Denver area, which had a 3.0 rate, he said. Still, Frey said he considers numeric gains to be a more accurate measure of where migrants are going. Numeric gains, he said, are ""not affected by the size of the destination population  In other words, among all the places in the country, which places are gaining the biggest aggregate numbers of migrants? The rate, is more of an ‘impact’ measure: how are recent migrants affecting the destination population?"" Generally, Frey said, the Austin area ""has both educational and employment opportunities relevant to young people who are looking to advance -- especially during a period when many other places have taken sharp employment hits. Even if young people coming to Austin are not getting their dream jobs right away, they will be networking with others who might make that happen. This will not be the case in many other places."" We wondered why Austin’s rank slipped. Frey said that as the economy ""slowly revives elsewhere, there will  be competitors, but being number two or number five"" isn’t bad, he wrote. Wynn, apprised of the Austin area’s latest ranking, speculated by email that Austin by itself, rather than the metro area, draws more young adults than any other U.S. city. Our ruling Wynn said more 25- to 34-year-olds are moving to Austin than any other city in America. Wynn did not offer nor did we find data specific to individual cities.

A report released last year by the European Court of Auditors said that air pollution causes about 400,000 premature deaths each year in the EU and hundreds of billions of euros in health-related external costs. EU law requires countries to assess the level, notably in urban areas, of a range of pollutants, including ozone and particulate matter, and take action if certain limits are hit. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) was asked to rule in a case brought against Brussels by residents and campaign group ClientEarth over the region’s air quality plan. The ECJ judgment came a day after a ground-breaking ruling where a local court said France was responsible for air pollution in the Ile-de-France region around Paris, although it did not award damages to a mother and daughter who had suffered respiratory ailments. The ECJ said that while authorities could choose where to conduct sampling, this needed to include the most polluted areas and concluded that the average measurement from different parts of the city did not show the exposure to pollutants. To determine whether a limit had been reached in a calendar year it was sufficient if the pollution level was higher than the limit at a single sampling point, the ECJ said. It also found that national courts were empowered to review the location of air quality stations and could order local authorities to make sure they are located appropriately. “The ostrich-like approach, where some authorities try to hide the real extent of pollution rather than ensure their citizens breathe clean air, must stop,” Jens Muller, air quality manager at Brussels-based campaign group Transport and Environment, said in a statement.",true,Environment
38,2791,Drug critic slams FDA over antibiotic oversight in meat production.,"January 28, 2014","The United States Food and Drug Administration allowed 18 animal drugs to stay on the market even after an agency review found the drugs posed a “high risk” of exposing humans to antibiotic-resistant bacteria through food supply, according to a study released Monday by the Natural Resources Defense Council.","P.J. Huffstutter, Brian Grow","The study by the NRDC, a non-governmental group that criticizes the widespread use of drugs in the meat industry, is the latest salvo in the national debate over the long-standing practice of antibiotic use in meat production. Agribusinesses say animal drugs help increase production and keep prices low for U.S. consumers, while consumer advocates and some scientists raise concerns over antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The FDA stirred the debate late last year when it unveiled guidelines for drug makers and agricultural companies to voluntarily phase out antibiotic use as a growth enhancer in livestock. The agency said those guidelines were an effort to stem the surge in human resistance to certain antibiotics. But the NRDC’s study found the FDA took no action to remove 30 antibiotic-based livestock feed products from the market even after federal investigators determined many of those antibiotics fell short of current regulatory standards for protecting human health. NRDC studied a review conducted by the FDA from 2001 to 2010 that focused on 30 penicillin and tetracycline-based antibiotic feed additives. The drugs had been approved by regulators to be used specifically for growth promotion of livestock and poultry - essentially to produce more meat to sell. The FDA, in a statement, said it began a review of older, approved penicillin and tetracycline products in 2001, and issued letters to companies who made the products asking for additional safety data. “Based on its review of this and other information, the Agency chose to employ a strategy that would more broadly address the concerns about the production use of medically important antimicrobials in food-producing animals,” the FDA said. Some academics specializing in antibiotic resistance criticized the NRDC’s study, saying that the findings do not reflect current regulatory standards because some of the drugs have been withdrawn from the market. They also say that the study assessed FDA safety guidelines that have been replaced with more stringent standards. Dr. Randall Singer, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota, told Reuters that drug makers and the U.S. livestock industry are phasing out antibiotics used principally for growth promotion. “We have been telling (both of) them for years to be prepared for the elimination of growth promotion and feed efficiency labeling because you cannot make that change overnight,” said Singer, who reviewed the NRDC report for Reuters. The NRDC, which reviewed more than 3,000 pages of documents through a federal Freedom of Information Act request, said it found evidence to suggest nine of the drugs are still on the market and used by livestock producers. Reuters was not able to independently verify that detail immediately. One of the drugs still on the market is animal health company Zoetis Inc’s Penicillin G Procaine 50/100, which is fed to poultry in part to aid in weight gain. The NRDC says the FDA twice laid out its concerns to that drug maker that the product failed to meet safety regulations. The unnamed original sponsor of the drug apparently disputed the regulators’ findings, according to excerpts from a 1997 letter sent to the FDA and included in documents obtained by the NRDC. A spokeswoman for Zoetis, a unit of Pfizer Inc that owns the drug today, said the company already is working to phase out use of the drug for growth promotion as part of the new FDA guidelines and is planning to relabel the drug for more limited purposes. Once companies remove farm-production uses of their antibiotics from drug labels, it would become illegal for those drugs to be used for those purposes, Deputy FDA Commissioner Michael Taylor told reporters recently. Although the program is meant to be voluntary, Taylor said the FDA would be able to take regulatory action against companies that fail to comply. In its statement on Monday, the FDA said it is “confident that its current strategy to protect the effectiveness of medically important antimicrobials, including penicillins and tetracyclines, is the most efficient and effective way to change the use of these products in animal agriculture.”  NRDC attorney Avinash Kar, one of the study’s authors, said the group’s findings raise questions about whether regulators will be effective in enforcing the new guidelines. “The FDA’s failure to act on its own findings about the 30 reviewed antibiotic feed additives is part of a larger pattern of delay and inaction in tackling livestock drug use that goes back four decades,” Kar told Reuters.",true,Health News

And what I observe is a smart guy who consistently enjoys asserting his intellectual supremacy over others more than he actually likes educating. In one of his worse moments, Tyson mocked a 12-year-old girl who suggested she’d like to live on Jupiter. He ridiculed her in the midst of a crowd, then later, several times, on Twitter. That told me everything I needed to know about Neil deGrasse Tyson. For that moment he was just a horse’s astrophysicist. Although Larson didn’t provide a link to the purported dressing down administered by Tyson, it wasn’t difficult to locate the source of his claim — a 1 December 2015 item published by the satirical web site ClickHole describing a purported interaction between an 8-year-old girl and Tyson: Get ready for the most incredible science win ever, delivered by none other than Neil deGrasse Tyson. He’s pretty much the king when it comes to shutting down people who peddle bad science, but this most recent case completely takes the cake: When an 8-year-old told the badass astrophysicist that she wanted to live on Jupiter, he completely shut her down using science. Amazing! How many times can Neil deGrasse Tyson win the internet? The epic science burn happened toward the end of one of Neil’s lectures at the Hayden Planetarium in New York last weekend. Third-grader Liza Collins was attending the lecture with her parents, and during the Q&A session, she raised her hand and told Neil that she wanted to live on Jupiter. But Neil wasn’t about to let her—and her bunk science—off the hook. “Hold on, you want to live where?” Tyson said. “On a planet made entirely of unbreathable gases? One that doesn’t even have a rocky surface you could stand on? A planet that would take you six years to even get to? That’s where you want to live? Because that’s Jupiter. Enjoy your great new home!” And of course, Neil didn’t let it end there. After the event, the Cosmos host took to Twitter to really show Liza what’s what. The ClickHole piece also included screenshots of what looked to be tweets sent by Tyson: Larson didn’t appear to be aware that ClickHole is a satirical site (an offshoot of The Onion) and that none of its content was meant to be taken seriously. Each page bears a disclaimer subtly indicating as much: ClickHole uses invented names in all of its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental. ClickHole is not intended for readers under 18 years of age. A lengthy comment appended to the ClickHole article has been attributed to Tyson, but it isn’t clear if the remarks were genuinely his. (Tyson did not link to the column on Twitter nor reference it on any platform we were able to locate.) The comment (which, if inauthentic, replicated the astrophysicist’s tone quite well) countered: Hello Neal First, I’ll forgive you for not spelling your name correctly. Second, and more importantly, I don’t mind being labeled a horse’s astrophysicist (I see what you did there), provided it’s based on factual information. So what we must do is subtract the false information from your article, and then re-assess what name you choose to call me. If it still justifies “horse’s astrophysicist”, then so be it. 1) FYI: The cosmic perspective is all about having a second look at what, on the surface appears to be important, special, ego-boosting, etc. The Olympic medal count is not immune from this analysis. In fact an even better measure is medals per GDP per capita. This will tell you how efficiently and effectively a country is spending its wealth on athletic excellence. The Tweet, though based only on population, was a playful plea that we could be winning even more medals than we are. 2) I am agnostic, and actively disavow the atheist label: [Audio: 6m30s]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnHY1cC9a4A [Video: 3m 48s] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSMC5rWvos 3) People who deny human-induced climate change are badly misinformed. This position is neither politically Liberal nor Conservative. It’s factual. Although one could argue that all those who want to preserve the environment are the real conservatives in this discussion. 4) You use “Liberal” as a tag to characterize my politics. Since I have no active public political position, that’s a hard task to accomplish. Climate change deniers are misinformed. But so are people who think vaccines gives you autism. And so are people who think genetically modified foods are bad for you.

It looks to be a hoax. No such tweets ever existed on November 29th, 2015, or on any other day. My only tweet on November 29, 2015 (as my followers can attest, and as anyone can see from scrolling my Twitter page was: Starship Enterprise versus Millennium Falcon. Oh yeah, I went there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMH1vDDd1xc So you abrogated your journalistic integrity by not verifying what you read in somebody else’s article, before using it as a foundational pillar in yours. 6) I am 3x appointed by President George W. Bush, serving on commissions to advise him on the future of the American aerospace Industry, on NASA, and on the annual Presidential Medial of science winners. So your disapproval of my views is not shared by others on the conservative spectrum. 7) Lastly: my research output as a scientist is not hidden. You can find it here, if you are interested: http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/curriculum-vitae So when you factor in (or simply subtract) all these elements from your writeup, If what remains still justifies labeling me a horses astrophysicist, then, as I said, I’m okay with that.

Before he starts cutting hair, Maulanasyah sprays his  protective gear and his customers’ hands with sanitizer. He has worn the gear for the past two weeks as part of efforts to cut the risks from the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus that has killed at least 240 people and infected nearly 3,000 in the world’s fourth most populous country. Health workers in Indonesia have paid a high price, with at least 24 doctors dying from the disease, according to the Indonesian Doctors Association. In Jakarta, 130 medical workers have been infected, according to the city government said. Jakarta has ordered businesses and schools to close in a bid to contain the virus and it plans large-scale social restrictions enforced by security personnel.

Customer Abdul Rahman Fattah said he felt safer having his hair cut this way but conceded that the cumbersome outfit worn by Maulanasyah meant the result may not always be perfect. As another precautionary measure, Maulanasyah allows only four people in the salon and urges everyone to keep their distance. “This is to protect myself because I have a family, my child and wife, therefore I need to ensure my safety at work because I don’t know whether the people who come here are infected or not,” he said.",true,Health News
43,21813,Voted the ‘best specialty plate in America’,"July 3, 2011",Rhode Island lighthouse group says its fundraising license plate was voted best specialty plate in U.S.,Richard Salit,"Specialty license plates are all the rage. In some states, you can choose from as many as 200 kinds. Rhode Island is no exception. You can pick from five specialty plates, with more on the way, not counting traditional ones for firefighters and the military. They’ve become so prominent that one -- promoting Plum Beach Lighthouse -- appears on a billboard on a stretch of Route 95 traveled by 100,000 motorists a day. ""Voted the ‘best specialty plate in American,’ "" the billboard reads. Now that’s license to brag! But is it true? We looked to our own navigational beacon, the Truth-O-Meter, to guide us. Our voyage first took us to the billboard near the Providence-Pawtucket line, best visible to southbound motorists. It shows the license plate, with its idyllic image of the Plum Beach Lighthouse surrounded by placid blue waters and two sport fishermen in a boat. ""Get yours now!"" reads the billboard, directing people to a Web site. ""Thousands sold!"" The license plate is a fundraising tool for Friends of Plum Beach Lighthouse, which acquired the 1897 lighthouse 22 years ago with the goal of preserving it. The spark-plug style lighthouse, off North Kingstown in Narragansett Bay’s West Passage, was abandoned following construction of the Jamestown Bridge in 1941. Seeking to raise funds to paint the lighthouse, the organization got General Assembly approval in late 2009 for a license plate commemorating the landmark. Since then, the group has sold nearly 4,300 plates, the most of any specialty plate in Rhode Island, president David Zapatka told us. Specialty plates cost $41.50, with $20 going toward the sponsoring group. So far, $86,000 has been raised for the lighthouse, some of which was used to paint the landmark and install solar-powered lighting, Zapatka said. Following the debut of the lighthouse tag, a local license plate lover nominated it for a competition held by the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association (ALPCA). Every year, its 3,000 members nominate license plates -- only new ones, by the way -- and then vote on the best. ALPCA announced that its members selected from 12 finalists from 2010. Half were so-called ""general issue"" plates, the kind that states redesign every few years and which most motorists get when they register their vehicles. The other half were specialty plates. New Mexico’s bright turquoise and gold plate took first. Plum Beach Lighthouse got second. While it was honored as the runner-up, it received no accolades for ""best"" anything. So we asked Zapatka to shine some light on the billboard’s claim. ""I figured we might get called on that,"" he said immediately. ""Rather than put up on the billboard, ‘We are the second best plate in America,’ we changed the wording to say we are the ‘best specialty plate in America.’ Did they officially come out and say, ‘You are the best specialty in America’? No."" But, he insisted, Plum Beach Lighthouse beat out the other five specialty plates, not to mention all but one of the other plates. ""Is it a stretch? Yes,"" he acknowledged. But, he said, ""there is no other specialty plate that finished higher than us in the competition. … It’s a marketing scheme."" What does ALPCA think about how the Rhode Island group is tooting its horn?

46,31225,Women absorb and retain DNA from every man they have had sex with.,"June 26, 2017","We are also unsure, for the record, what motivation would exist for scientists to hide the truth about male microchimerism in the first place.",Alex Kasprak,"On 23 June 2017, frequent purveyor of misinformation YourNewsWire.com posted an article (“Women Absorb and Retain DNA from Every Man They Have Sex With”) that made the claim that “a new study” demonstrates that cells transferred from a man to a woman during intercourse become integrated into that woman’s body after sex. Every single time. In actuality, however, that study (which was published in PLOS ONE in 2012, despite being billed as “new” in 2017) demonstrated for the first time the presence of genetically distinct male cells in the brains of women (who had been examined in autopsy). The existence of male cells in the bodies of females, in general, is not news. As discussed in a PLOS ONE blog post describing that 2012 study, their presence is typically ascribed to cells from a male fetus from a prior pregnancy: The idea of two genetically distinct populations of cells, or their DNA, residing in one individual isn’t new. It’s called microchimerism. […] Medical chimerism arises after a transfusion or transplant, and it may follow pregnancy. Our microbiomes, the bacteria within us, are more like guests than body parts. [The research groups responsible for the 2012 study] found Y chromosome DNA sequences in several brain regions in autopsy slides from 37 out of 59 women. Such DNA liberated from fetal cells can come from several sources: children, fetuses that never made it to be born, older siblings, or twins. Both son and daughter DNA partake in this “feto-maternal trafficking,” but female DNA, at the chromosomal level, is harder to detect amid the maternal two X’s. The significance, in the case of that specific research paper, was that it demonstrated that these male cells — wherever they came from — were able to cross what is known as the blood-brain barrier — a semi-permeable membrane that prevents most chemicals in the blood from entering the brain. The linked study, in fact, does not once mention sexual intercourse as a proposed mechanism. This is as close as you will get from the PLOS ONE paper: The most likely source of male [microchimerism, Mc] in female brain is acquisition of fetal Mc from pregnancy with a male fetus. In women without sons, male DNA can also be acquired from an abortion or a miscarriage. The pregnancy history was unknown for all but a few subjects in the current studies, thus male Mc in female brain could not be evaluated according to specific prior pregnancy history. In addition to prior pregnancies, male Mc could be acquired by a female from a recognized or vanished male twin, an older male sibling, or through non-irradiated blood transfusion. At least that’s what they want you to think, according to YourNewsWire: Through the study the researchers assumed that the most likely answer was that all male DNA found living in the female brain came from a male pregnancy. That was the safe, politically correct assumption. But these researchers were living in denial. Because when they autopsied the brains of women who had never even been pregnant, let alone with a male child, they STILL found male DNA cells prevalent in the female brain. At this point the scientists didn’t know what the hell was going on. Confused, they did their best to hide the evidence until they could understand and explain it. They buried it in numerous sub studies and articles, but if you sift through them all you will find the damning statement, the one line that gives the game away and explains exactly where these male DNA cells come from. In an odd chronologic twist that necessitates abandoning the notion that time progresses linearly in one direction, YourNewsWire then used text from a paper published in 2005 to support the argument that scientists buried this salacious truth, discovered in 2012, in other “sub studies”. That 2005 paper, which does indeed show the presence of male cells in women who had never given birth to males (or, in some cases, at all), makes only passing reference to the possibility that sexual intercourse alone could contribute male microchirality to women, noting that the issue has yet to be studied: Another possibility that has not been investigated is whether male DNA can be detected in a woman’s circulation from sexual intercourse without pregnancy. That explanation is the authors’ speculative fourth suggestion (out of four) after three more plausible, and actually researched, theories: One potential explanation for male microchimerism could be a nonrecognized (male) miscarriage. […] A second potential source is from a “vanished (male) twin.” A vanished twin is thought to be a relatively common phenomena resulting from spontaneous resorption of one sac or embryo in a twin pregnancy. […] A third possibility is from an older male sibling transferred by the maternal circulation to the fetus of a later pregnancy. [i.e. you are born with male DNA your older brother left behind in your mother’s body]. A paper published, fittingly, in the journal Chimerism in 2015 investigated this topic further, concluding that — potentially — all of those potential mechanisms may contribute. That paper, which was fairly limited in its dataset, makes it clear that the sexual intercourse transfer of male chimerism remains entirely speculative: A total of 154 girls were studied of which 21 (13.6%) tested positive for male microchimerism. There was a tendency that girls were more likely to test positive for male microchimerism if their mothers previously had received transfusion, had given birth to a son or had had a spontaneous abortion. Furthermore, the oldest girls were more likely to test positive for male microchimerism. However, less than half of microchimerism positivity was attributable to these factors. In conclusion, data suggest that male microchimerism in young girls may originate from an older brother either full born or from a discontinued pregnancy or from transfusion during pregnancy. We speculate that sexual intercourse may be important but other sources of male cells likely exist in young girls. Far from demonstrating that 100 percent of a woman’s male sexual partners have male cells that de facto become part of their body, the studies cobbled together by YourNewsWire show that even if sexual intercourse transferred cells from a male that later became incorporated into the female partner’s body (which science has only speculated about at this point), it clearly wouldn’t happen in all cases.",false,"Medical, dna, newspunch.com, sex"
47,30819,"Canada has legalized euthanasia, enabling parents to ""kill disabled children.","November 27, 2017","On 22 November 2017, YourNewsWire.com reported that “Doctors in Canada have been given the green-light to euthanise disabled, sick or dying children under a controversial new law.” The “controversial new law” passed in June 2016, not November 2017. Further, that law specifically prohibits even “mature minors” (much less parents) the ability to choose medically assisted death, and it is not by even the most creative interpretation a free pass to euthanize children.",Kim LaCapria,"On 22 November 2017, the web sites Neon Nettle and YourNewsWire.com (among others) published reports about euthanasia and pediatric patients in Canada, claiming that “a controversial new law” now allows parents to end the lives of children with disabilities: The legislation extends existing ‘assisted suicide’ laws that have been legal in Canada over a year now, in which adults can legally volunteer to end their own life. The new legislation passes the responsibility of consensual death for minors over to the parents. Liftsitenews.com reports: American anti-euthanasia activist Wesley Smith said the results of the survey prove the morally slippery slope that a nation slides down when it agrees that “killing is an acceptable answer to human suffering.” “Once euthanasia consciousness is unleashed, it never stops expanding,” he wrote in the National Review. “I guess Robert Latimer–a Canadian farmer who murdered his daughter because she had cerebral palsy–was a visionary,” he added. Neither site referenced any news reports to support the claims, linking instead to a 26 October 2017 National Review Online speculative editorial: “Canada Child Euthanasia: A Matter of Time?” That opinion piece speculated that legal euthanasia in Canada could eventually be available to minors: Once euthanasia consciousness is unleashed, it never stops expanding. The law is still brand new, and yet there is already talk about allowing dementia patients to be killed and a mentally ill patient was euthanized with the permission of a court. And now, children are in the target range. From the CBC story: The Canadian Paediatric Society says its members are “increasingly” being asked by parents about the option of seeking medically assisted death for children, while a survey of doctors found nearly half of the respondents supported assisted death for kids with “progressive terminal illness or intractable pain.” The linked article examines the provisions of euthanasia-related legislation passed in June 2016 (Bill C-14). Among them is a years-long review of youth access to medically assisted dying: “Medical assistance in dying is something that has been legislated [for adults] and stated [as] needing to be accessible … but there isn’t the same ‘oomph’ for saying that all Canadians need good access to palliative care,” said Dr. Dawn Davies, chair of the society’s bioethics committee and a pediatric palliative care physician in Edmonton, in an interview with CBC News. “Where the issue of medical assistance in dying is ever raised by a child, you know, we would advocate that that should automatically be a referral for pediatric palliative care.” When Bill C-14, the law governing medically assisted dying for adults, was passed in June 2016, it included a requirement that the ministers of justice and health initiate an independent review on whether “mature minors” — youth under age 18 but deemed capable of giving consent — should be eligible for medically assisted death. That review is expected to be presented to Parliament by December 2018. According to the report, ongoing research includes feedback from pediatricians about discussions with the parents of “critically ill” minors: In addition to the “mature minors” question, the surveys also found that parents are asking pediatricians about assisted death on behalf of their critically ill children. Out of the 1,050 pediatricians who responded, 118 said they had exploratory discussions about assisted death with the parents of sick children, involving 419 kids in all. Forty-five respondents said they had received explicit requests for assisted death from parents, involving a total of 91 children. More than half of the requests involved a child under a year old. There needs to be “a recognition that parents are making this request not as a self-serving thing,” Davies told The Canadian Press. “[Those] children have illnesses where there is really profound suffering.” Canada’s Department of Justice’s “Questions and Answers” page (archived) about the June 2016 law addresses “mature minors,” but not parents: At this time, not enough is known about the risks and benefits of medical assistance in dying for minors. The trial judge in [a related ruling] found that, to the degree that there was a societal consensus on eligibility for medical assistance in dying, it was limited to mentally competent or capable adults…. However, the Government would also initiate an independent review of the special considerations related to requests for medical assistance in dying by mature minors within 180 days of the legislation receiving Royal Assent.",false,"Junk News, canada, disabled, euthanasia"
48,10075,Children in intensive care recover faster with little to no nutrition,"March 24, 2016","This brief news release, issued by a university hospital system in Belgium, is loosely based on published results of a multinational, randomized clinical study designed to test the value of adding early intravenous macronutrient feedings to the nutritional care of critically ill children in intensive care units who are unable to eat or be fed normally. Such so-called “total” parenteral nutrition, delivered via the bloodstream, is commonplace in pediatric ICUs, researchers say, because of concerns that “macronutrient deficits” will lead to increased infections, weakness, and longer stays on ventilators and in ICUs overall. The problem, however, has been the dearth of rigorous scientific evidence for this assumption in children, and — significantly — growing evidence in studies of adults that the practice actually delays healing and increases infections. The study on which the release is based does indeed add strong clinical evidence that the same is true for children, and that delaying for a week or so the use of full parenteral feedings is clearly associated with lower rates of infections and earlier discharge from the ICUs. But this release could leave some readers with the misconception that starving critically ill children will hasten their recovery from a critical illness. Here’s why: contrary to the language in the release, the study did not “prove” the idea that “receiving little or no nutrition” in the first week of an ICU stay “makes children recover faster.” Nor were these children “fasting,” in the conventional sense. In fact, all of the children received micronutrients (such as vitamins and minerals), blood sugar controls, and “enteral” nutrition in which some nutrients are delivered through a tube from the nose to the stomach. The release further misleadingly implies that “nutritional deficiency” somehow directly leads to faster and better recoveries for seriously ill children; in fact, the authors of the published study report that the reason for the benefit of delaying total parenteral nutrition remains “speculative,” but possibly due to complex effects of digestion and metabolism that have an impact on the immune system. Although numbers are hard to come by (and the release makes no effort to find any) an estimated quarter million infants and children a year are admitted to intensive care units with critical illnesses and injuries. Scientists know that  the nutritional needs of children’s rapidly growing brains and bodies make their care trickier in some respects than adult care, and the use of intravenous feedings of a complete package of calories and specific nutrients are commonly started within 24 hours of an ICU stay. But few studies have been done to test the value of such feedings, usually given as supplements or sometimes in place of enteral feedings of some nutrients through a nasogastric tube. And studies in adults have strongly suggested that parenteral feedings are associated with higher rates of infection and longer ICU stays. This study matters because treatment of children in the ICU is not uncommon and the outcomes of interest (time in the ICU, complication rates, death) are important to everyone.","Joann Rodgers, MS,Kathleen Fairfield, MD, DrPH,Kathlyn Stone","We rated this Not Applicable since giving parenteral (IV) nutrition seems to be done routinely and this study reviewed withholding it (which should save money). The biggest cost saver might be fewer days in the ICU. Some discussion of the cost-benefit analysis of changing the protocol might have been helpful to readers. The release quotes the lead coordinating investigator saying “the current practice of feeding children in an early stage does not contribute to their recovery,” but it offers not a single data point. There is no information provided other than the number of total participants, and no mention of the makeup of the randomized groups, the specific findings, or the comparative rates of new infections and lengths of ICU stay (the two endpoints of the study overall). The release does note more correctly at one point that the study was designed to “challenge the validity” of early parenteral feeding, but it never explains the details or context of those feedings. The absolute difference in the outcomes between groups is left unanswered. The study report goes into substantial background detail about potential harms of malnutrition and overfeeding, and the release — although without specific data — more or less describes the concerns. The release could have been strengthened even more if it had informed readers about the rigorous informed consent obtained from parents, and the efforts to maintain basic nutrient levels in all the children. The release did not include enough details about the design for most readers to make sense of the study. There’s almost no information about the makeup of the protocol feedings, the use of insulin, micronutrients, saline and glucose solutions, or the limitations of the study duly noted by the researchers in their report. Importantly, it’s not made clear that these children were being provided nutrition through a feeding tube in their stomachs. The release doesn’t give us any sense of how many children may be assigned to the ICU, or how many might benefit from a change in nutrition protocol. So while it doesn’t disease-monger, we’re hesitant to give the release credit here. We’ll call it Not Applicable. There’s no information in the release about funding or potential conflicts of interest. This release is about a comparative study between early and late parenteral feeding upon admittance to an ICU. Parenteral feedings are a part of standard care and that is understood. The release states that a new nutrition protocol has disproven a theory about standard care. That’s novel. But while the release points out that assumptions about parenteral feeding in children needed — and got — a good challenge, it fails to note that children most vulnerable to malnutrition sustained the most benefit from delayed parenteral feeding. That’s another novel finding that could have been included. The release makes some unattributed and over-the-top statements including “The results are remarkable”  and “These findings…can thus be expected to change pediatric intensive care worldwide.”",false,"Academic medical center news release,University news release"

There are legal and operational obstacles to making this scenario a reality, we learned. But Taylor’s carefully worded statement was about the state of the technology, and her scenario is technically possible right now.",Dave Umhoefer,"On April 1, 2014 state Rep. Chris Taylor warned the citizenry about eyes in the sky and attacks on privacy. ""Drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet,"" the Madison Democrat wrote in a news release. Was Taylor pulling the public’s leg on April Fools’ Day? No, she was dead serious. Taylor spoke the day the state Senate approved and sent to Gov. Scott Walker a bipartisan bill -- cosponsored by Taylor -- to put limits on drone use. The Wisconsin bill, similar to others around the country, attempts to prohibit both law enforcement agencies and private individuals from recording people in locations where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Example: inside their homes. Under the legislation, it would be unlawful in a criminal investigation for police -- without first getting a search warrant -- to use drones equipped with video or audio recording equipment to collect evidence in such locations. Emergency exceptions to this prohibition include locating an escaped prisoner, aiding in a search and rescue mission, executing an arrest warrant or preventing imminent harm to a person or the imminent destruction of evidence. The bill allows hobbyists, entrepreneurs or aerial photographers to use drones as long as that use does not intentionally violate an individual’s privacy interests. Gov. Scott Walker signed it into law on April 8, 2014. Taylor, in her statement, focuses on the state of the technology, not on who is doing the recording. Let’s see if she’s correct. Some basics first. Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are small aircraft that can fly by remote control without an onboard human operator. They can be part of a system that includes a digital network and personnel on the ground, and can be equipped with high-powered cameras, with infrared devices that sense objects through walls, and with laser radar that can see through trees and foliage, the Congressional Research Service said in a 2013 report. Their use by law enforcement and the military in the U.S. ""raises far-reaching issues concerning the extent of government surveillance authority, the value of privacy in the digital age, and the role of Congress in reconciling these issues,"" the report noted. To address Taylor’s specific statement, we turned to government studies, technology and privacy experts, law enforcement officials and drone manufacturers. The bottom line: A wide range of experts said Taylor’s scenario reflects the capability of current technology. Size Drones can be as small as insects and as large as regular aircraft. Models used by law enforcement have included the Draganflyer X4-ES, which is just 24 inches wide, and the AeroVironment Wasp, described as ""bird-size"" in a Washington Post story about Texas police conducting discreet video surveillance before a SWAT team stormed a property that officials believed had a cache of weapons. A tiny drone developed for the U.S. military weighs less than a AA battery and resembles a live hummingbird that can hover, climb, fly through an open doorway and relay real-time video back to its operator, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. That drone, AeroVironment’s Nano Hummingbird, could someday provide new reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities in urban environments, the AeroVironment website says. Someday, because it’s not in production yet. Army-technology.com said in 2012 that UAVs ""are getting smaller and more agile to enable combatants to gather intelligence from hard to reach areas, such as in buildings and through tunnels."" Internet A Draganflyer official told us it’s easy to upload the live video images that a remote operator is viewing. It just takes some additional equipment. ""That’s a minor thing as far as I’m concerned,"" said Kevin Lauscher, a former police officer who is now sales manager and flight trainer at Draganfly Innovations. ""The realistic expectation of privacy is pretty weak in these days of technology"" and people recording conversations and posting photos with their phones, he said. Recording people in their homes Taylor aide Craig Trost told us the representative meant recording through a window, not with see-through-walls camera technology that is still under development. Taking pictures of people inside their home is possible with a drone, various law enforcement officials told us. Image quality would be a major challenge though. Daniel Schwarzbach, a pilot for the Houston Police and executive director of the Airborne Law Enforcement Association, said police could film people through their windows after getting a search warrant but he doesn’t recall that happening or police being interested in it. So, Taylor’s description of drone capabilities is not imaginary. How likely it is to happen? That’s an important question, and we got an earful on it, though we don’t think the answer bears directly on the accuracy of her warning about what is possible with current technology. ""Doing what she is afraid of would be difficult at best, it would be illegal under peeping Tom laws, and it’s not on the agenda of law enforcement,"" said Gregory McNeal,  a national security and criminal law expert at Pepperdine University law school. McNeal added: ""If she is worried about invasions of privacy, she should update Wisconsin’s invasion of privacy laws for all forms of observation, not just drones because what she’s alleging can be done by a drone can be done with an iPhone, any camera, or binoculars."" The privacy issue is not about unmanned aircraft, it is about image capture and retention, in the view of  Alan Frazier, a University of North Dakota aviation professor and former Grand Forks County sheriff’s deputy. ""Agencies need to have  a robust policy in place regarding appropriate uses of all types of image capture devices,"" he said. Taylor, a lawyer, says it’s not at all clear that current law criminalizes peeping remotely using a drone. Law enforcement officials using drones told us a rogue user might try to do that, but not them. ""We cannot look into homes, our systems are twice the size of a goose and we don't operate in areas where we have internet,  nor do we have, or need, the desire to upload anything to the internet …"" said Ben Miller, director of the Mesa County, Colorado, unmanned aircraft systems program. ""We mostly take aerial pictures of crime scenes and conduct aerial search and rescue flights."" Taylor, for the record, says she wasn’t suggesting that law enforcement was illegally peeking into windows, just the possible uses of the technology. Allie Bohm, advocacy and policy strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union, said a hobbyist could buy a drone size of a large bird and put a camera on it and get video and put it on the Internet. But Bohm called that a ""side issue"" because there’s no evidence drones are being widely employed in that fashion, in part due to Federal Aviation Administration rules, Bohm said. Public entities seeking to fly drones must get FAA approval. More than 1,800 have done so since 2007, including law enforcement, firefighting, border patrol, disaster relief, search and rescue, military training, and other government operational missions, the FAA says. (The Milwaukee Police Department does not own or use drones, spokesman Mark Stanmeyer told us.) Under current FAA rules, a drone must be flown within the line of sight of the operator, less than 400 feet above the ground, during daylight conditions, inside uncontrolled airspace and more than five miles from any airport or other location with aviation activities. ""Flying model aircraft solely for hobby or recreational reasons does not require FAA approval, but hobbyists must operate according to the agency's model aircraft guidance,"" FAA spokesman Les Dorr said in a statement. Commercial operations are only authorized on a case-by-case basis and to date, only one has met these criteria, using Insitu's ScanEagle. A commercial flight requires a certified aircraft, a licensed pilot and operating approval. That authorization was limited to the Arctic. Our rating Taylor said that ""drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet."" There are legal and operational obstacles to making this scenario a reality, we learned.

51,29319,"A photograph shows people lining up outside a Houston, Texas shelter to turn in unwanted animals to be euthanized.","June 29, 2017","What's true: It's statistically likely that around three quarters of those photographed with animals were turning in stray or unwanted animals. What's false: The vast majority of animals turned in to this particular shelter are not put down. Statistically, only around 14% of animals in the photograph were likely to end up being euthanized.",Dan MacGuill,"On 27 June 2017, the Facebook page of the “Special Needs Animal Rescue and Rehabilitation” organization (also called SNARR) posted a photo of people with animals lining up outside a Houston, Texas animal shelter, purportedly to surrender the pets and have them put down:  This is the line at the Houston, Texas city shelter today to surrender animals. These dogs and cats are about to be DUMPED to face a death sentence. SNARR’s Facebook post was subsequently picked up by One Green Planet web site, whose article about the topic was headlined: “[What the Hell]!? People are Literally Lining Up to Dump Their Pets Before July 4th Weekend.” The Pet Rescue Report got in on the action as well, writing: “Heartbreaking Reality: Owners Line Up at Shelter to Surrender Their Pets Before July 4th Parties.” The Facebook post was removed on 1 July 2017, but had been widely shared, and some commenters began to question the sourcing and veracity of the claim that the owners shown in the photo were all in line to surrender their dogs. Many suggested that the demeanor of some of those in line was not indicative of giving up their dogs, and speculated that it was more likely to be a line for wellness checkups. Beforing removing it, SNARR had edited its original post, specifying that the two men shown in the immediate foreground of the photo left the line in order to have a wellness check-up for their pet, but still suggesting that all the others (around a dozen in the photo) were there to surrender theirs. We tracked down one of those men, Juan Martinez of Houston, Texas, whose identity we were able to verify. Martinez told us that he and his brother-in-law (also pictured), had visited the Bureau of Animal Regulation and Care (BARC) animal shelter on Carr Street in Houston on the afternoon of 27 June 2017. We were able to find documents showing that Martinez was there to have his mother’s newly-fostered kitten spayed and given deworming treatment. Contrary to what the group claimed on Facebook, Martinez said everyone waited in the same line, regardless of the purpose of their visit. Although he did not speak to anyone else in line, apart from his brother-in-law, he told us there was a positive atmosphere in the line, and that it was his impression that “nobody was there to drop [their pets] off.” A SNARR spokesperson told us that the organization’s treasurer took the photo at around noon on 27 June 2017. The group’s treasurer was there to help a friend look for a lost dog. The viral Facebook post was written by SNARR’s president, Lauren Connolly. Soon after the picture in question was taken, the shelter staff came out to ask people the reasoning for their visits (in order to bring in the wellness clinic visitors). The only people who stepped out were the two gentlemen with the cardboard carrier at the back of the line and the member of Snarr’s board, which [sic] were then brought to a different entrance. The rest were surrenders – whether it was owner surrenders or stray surrenders (stray being once someone’s pet – either that had been lost or that has been abandoned), we do not know. We asked SNARR how its treasurer found out that all the remaining visitors to the shelter were there to surrender pets. The group’s spokesperson said: Our treasurer did not affirm with each person if they were there to surrender. Conversations overheard in line and with the shelter staff that [sic] led the wellness clinic visitors out of the line and to a different entrance implied that. After publication of this article, SNARR’s treasurer contacted us to make clear that they had not taken the photo with the intention of it being published or used in the way it was. As of 1 July 2017, the treasurer had left SNARR, in response to the episode. A spokesperson for the Houston shelter explained the queuing system in place at the center. Their explanation contradicts some of the claims made by SNARR. According to BARC, everyone visiting the shelter stays in one line until they come through the front door. At that point they are asked the purpose of their visit, and triaged into three or four separate lines (one for the wellness clinic, one for the foster clinic, one or two to turn in stray or unwanted dogs.) This means that, in theory at least, any given group of people waiting outside the shelter would be there for a variety of reasons. The spokesperson told us that on 27 June 2017, the center offered the following services: adoptions, intake (stray and unwanted animals), a pet wellness clinic, foster clinic, and spay/neuter clinic. On that day, the shelter saw: 23 adoptions, 33 transfer/rescues (animals given to local rescue partners, who later adopt them out to the public), three lost dogs returned to their owners, seven dogs fostered out. 102 animals were turned in as strays, 52 dogs were surrendered by their owners, and 57 people visited the foster or wellness clinic with pets. Of the 211 cases where people brought animals to the shelter that day, 27% were visiting the foster or wellness clinic, and 73% were turning in dogs — either strangers presenting lost or stray dogs, or owners surrendering their pets. So it is statistically likely that about three-quarters of any given group waiting in line with animals outside the shelter that day, were turning in stray or unwanted dogs. So does this mean that all, or even most, of these dogs will be euthanized? No. SNARR’s Facebook post describes, in very emotive, even disturbing terms, the fate that supposedly awaits the animals seen in the photo: They’ll be dragged from the person they love, the person that swore to love and care for them for the duration of their lives. They’ll be confused, sad, but most of all terrified. The smell of death is overpowering here. After a day or two of sleeping on cold, dirty floors with the cacophony always all around, shivering and scared, they’ll be walked down a long hall to a room. A needle will slide into their veins and they’ll slip away, wondering where their beloved human is and why they never came back. All the while, their human is probably kicking back at the beach for the 4th of July weekend. Only 52 out of 211 animals (25 percent) brought to the shelter that day were brought by their owners, to be surrendered. Almost twice as many (102) were strays or lost dogs being brought to the shelter. And finally, more than 80 percent of dogs turned in to the BARC shelter — for whatever reason — are not put down. The shelter’s spokesperson provided us statistics showing that in 2016, 80.4 percent of animals turned in (either as strays, lost dogs, or by their owners), were successfully adopted out, returned to their owners or otherwise kept alive. (There is a sliver of irony in this episode. Juan Martinez, who was in the photo that accompanied Snarr’s inflammatory Facebook post, was bringing a fostered kitten to BARC for medical care. That kitten was once a stray, and could well have been turned in to the shelter by someone who once waited in line outside, just like those in the photo.) The percentage of dogs euthanized was 19.6 percent. Since the total number of dogs turned in on 27 June 2017 was 154, we can estimate that about 30 (19.6 percent) of these will end up being euthanized. And since the total number of animals brought to the center (including the medical and foster clinic) was 211 — this means only around 14 percent will end up being put down. In other words, the statistical likelihood is this: Of the animals waiting outside the BARC clinic at any given moment on 27 June 2017 — the day this viral photo was taken — the vast majority (around 86 percent) were likely not to end up being euthanized.",false,"Viral Phenomena, animal shelters, animals, cats"
52,33541,Hillary Clinton supported and helped free two Black Panthers accused of torturing and murdering Alex Rackley.,"June 30, 1999",Did Hillary Clinton support and help free two Black Panthers accused of murder?,David Mikkelson,"It’s difficult for those who weren’t around to experience the 1960s first-hand to fully understand the controversy that swirled around radical parties such as the Black Panthers. Certainly many Americans viewed them as representing the very worst of that era’s political movements: a group of hate-filled militant thugs who felt their disaffection with the existing social and political systems justified anything required to achieve their aim of “revolution by any means necessary” (such as smuggling guns into a Marin County courtroom in an attempt to free Panther George Jackson, resulting in a shoot-out that killed a judge, two inmates, and Jackson’s brother). Others at the time, however, believed the Panthers were the only political group that truly represented a downtrodden and marginalized group of people who had been enslaved, discriminated against, and denied civil rights protections for hundreds of years; that sought to improve the condition of the poor by operating schools, opening medical clinics, and providing free breakfasts for ghetto children; and that had the courage to stand up to the brutality visited upon them by law enforcement acting in the service of a government and a society that sought to “keep them in their place.” In May of 1969, Black Panther founder and national chairman Bobby Seale (who had already been indicted for his alleged participation in demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 1968) made a trip from Oakland to New Haven, Connecticut, to speak at Yale University. The Black Panthers were by then nationally known, a focus of media attention, and under the active surveillance of the FBI. (J. Edgar Hoover had publicly declared several months earlier that he considered the Panthers “the greatest threat to the internal security of the country.”) Rumors of police informants and government spies having infiltrated the party were rampant, and a man named Alex Rackley, a member of the Panthers’ New York chapter, fell under suspicion. Rackley was taken to the home of Warren Kimbro (described as a “community organizer and aspiring Panther”) where he was held captive for 24 hours, beaten, and scalded with boiling water in an effort to force him to confess. Rackley was then taken to a marsh in Middlefield by Kimbro, George Sams (a Panther field marshal and, according to some, himself a police informant), and Lonnie McLucas (a Panther member from Bridgeport), where Sams ordered Kimbro and McLucas to kill the suspected informant. (Who did the actual killing has always been disputed: McLucas reportedly fired the first shot, but Kimbro admitted to delivering the bullet to the head that killed Rackley.) Rackley’s body was discovered the next day by fishermen, and fourteen Black Panthers were arrested and charged with murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy, and nine of them were indicted. The subsequent murder trials of Black Panthers that took place in New Haven beginning in 1970 was a cause célèbre, the latest “trial of the century” that pitted the “establishment” against the “radicals”: the former supposedly valiantly defending the values of mainstream American society, while the latter were supposedly being framed and railroaded by government powers determined to destroy them at any cost. Upwards of 12,000 Black Panther supporters made their way to New Haven, and many of them were housed and fed in and around the campus of Yale University. Classes at Yale were made optional for the last few months of the term as Panther supporters swarmed the campus in protest and the president of Yale University, Kingman Brewster Jr., announced: “I personally want to say that I’m appalled and ashamed that things should have come to such a pass that I am skeptical of the ability of Black revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the U.S.” From that maelstrom came the 1999 political piece reproduced above, which claims that two 1990’s political figures, Hillary Clinton (then First Lady) and Bill Lann Lee (former acting head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division whose appointment by President Bill Clinton was controversial because of Lee’s support for affirmative action programs),  defended the Black Panthers, helped “shut down” Yale University, and aided the accused Panthers in going free or serving lenient sentences. But all of that is gross exaggeration: neither Clinton nor Lee did any of those things, and any involvement they had with the New Haven Black Panther trials was extremely minor and tangential. We’ll begin with the last part, the claim that “These two people actually went so far as to shut down Yale University with demonstrations in defense of the accused Black Panthers during their trial.”  This statement is ridiculously far-fetched: Yale University went to a “voluntarily optional” class schedule (it did not “shut down”) for a few months at the end of the term in mid-1970 because thousands of Black Panther protesters had flooded the campus and its environs, not because of anything Hillary Clinton or Bill Lee did. And while the Panthers made have found many sympathetic supporters among the student body at Yale, neither Hillary Clinton or Bill Lee led or participated in  student demonstrations in support of the Black Panthers, or spoke up in their defense. The above-quoted article also asks “How in the world do you think that these killers got off so easy? Well, maybe it was in some part due to the efforts of two people who came to the defense of the Panthers.”  But neither Bill Lee nor Hillary Clinton “defended” the Panthers, either in a public or a legal sense. Bill Lee wasn’t a lawyer, or even a law student; he was simply another Yale undergraduate who had no involvement in the Black Panthers’ trial. Hillary Rodham (as she was known then) wasn’t a lawyer then, either: She was a Yale law student, and like many of her politically-minded fellow law students who saw the latest “trial of the century” taking place just outside the main gate of their school, she took advantage of an opportunity to be involved in the case in a minor, peripheral way by organizing other students to help the American Civil Liberties Union monitor the trials for civil rights violations. Her tangential participation in the trial in no way helped “free” Black Panthers tried for the murder of Alex Rackley In fact, the killers of Alex Rackley didn’t “go free”: Lonnie McLucas was found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to twelve to fifteen years in prison,  and Warren Kimbro and George Sams turned state’s evidence and pleaded guilty to second degree murder, serving four years in prison. Bobby Seale and Ericka Huggins (who were accused not of killing Rackley, but of being present during his captivity and boiling water to torture him with) went free not due to any efforts on the part of Hillary Clinton or Bill Lee, but because the state failed to sufficiently prove its case against them: the jury deadlocked in favor of acquittal for both defendants, and the trial judge dismissed the charges against both of them. And, of course, neither Hillary Clinton nor Bill Lee had anything to do with the post-trial lives of Seale and Huggins.",false,"Uncategorized, black panthers, hillary clinton"
53,37784,A painting depicting J. Marion Sims' experiments on enslaved Black women is on display at the Alabama state Capitol.,"June 22, 2020",Is There a Painting of J. Marion Sims’ Experiments on Black Women at the Alabama State Capitol?,  Arturo Garcia  ,"Amid the removal and re-evaluation of statues commemorating historical figures in June 2020, a Facebook post that spread widely in June 2020 conflated a statue of a gynecologist who experimented on enslaved Black women with a painting depicting him alongside one of those women.The post by comedian Earthquake (a.k.a. Nathaniel Stroman) features a cropped photograph of the painting, which depicts Sims and two other men observing a woman identified as Lucy. Stroman’s post, which has been shared more than 70,000 times on Facebook, states:This painting hanging in the state capital of #Alabama take a long look at it. #JamesMarianSims – who perfected his surgical techniques by operating Without anesthesia on enslaved #blackwoman because he believed black women Didn’t Feel Pain. he described the experimental surgeries on his enslaved subjects as “So painful, that none but a woman could have borne them. After perfecting the techniques on black enslaved woman with out anesthesia in America, Sims went on to offer the procedure in Europe to wealthy white women who were sedated. This man is arguably the most famous American surgeon of the 19th century. I see him no different than Josef Megele both pure monsters.I hope everyone who goes to the gynecologist will close their eyes for a moment and honor these enslaved black women. I cannot, Cannot fathom the pain these black women endured under this man’s hands. And that painting…. who should be honored? The irony is also in their clothes. Some people, society look at people’s status, respect even on how one is dressed. The one who should be honered and respected is the one who owns no shoes.There is no record of the painting being on display at the Alabama State Capitol building. The full version of the painting shows Sims standing in front of Lucy, while two other women identified as Anarcha Westcott and Betsy watch from behind a makeshift curtain:Robert A. Thom’s painting is part of the series “Great Moments in Medicine,” which he did on commission by the pharmaceutical company Parke-Davis & Co. between 1948 and 1964. In 2007 Pfizer (which had acquired the collection of 45 paintings after buying out another company, Warner-Lambert) gave it to the University of Michigan Museum of Art, where they have been archived.The accompanying text for the painting, composed by Parke-Davis pharmacist George A. Bender, reads:Little did James Marion Sims, M.D., (1813-1883) dream, that summer day in 1845, as he prepared to examine the slave girl, Lucy, that he was launching on an international career as a gynecologic surgeon; or that he was to raise gynecology from virtually an unknown to respected medical specialty. Nor did he realize that his crude back-yard hospital in Montgomery, Alabama, would be the forerunner of the nation’s first Woman’s Hospital, which Sims helped to establish in New York in 1855. Dr. Sims, who became a leader in gynecology in Europe as well as in the United States, served as president of The American Medical Association, 1875-1876; and was honored by many nations.However, the museum’s description of the piece adds more context:By way of blinded valorization, Bender’s text sterilizes Sims’ years-long experimentation on the bodies of “Anarcha, Betsy, Lucy and about nine other unidentified enslaved women and girls” from 1844 to 1849. Eclipsed by Bender’s mythical-heroic account of Sims was the agonizing pain suffered by the patients experimented on before the wide use of anesthetics. At the same time, the enslaved labor responsible for the very construction of Sim’s “crude back-yard hospital” is rendered invisible. As Bender drew heavily upon Sims’ memoir to craft his captions, he, much like Sims, also failed to acknowledge the fact that the enslaved female patients were expected to continue their servitude even as patients. These women not only cooked, cleaned, and cared for the Sims family, but effectively kept the Alabama hospital running, serving as Sim’s surgical nurses throughout the five-year period of their “treatment.”Like Bender’s caption, Thom’s illustration also lionizes Sims, who stands with his arms folded at the head of the hospital scene. The illustration reproduces a racist, medical gaze, as it prompts the observer to join the ranks of other visiting surgeons who ogle Lucy as a medical object of curiosity. Through proper contextualization and careful visual study, we might challenge this supposed “great moment in medicine” and consider the contradictions of “scientific achievement” and the entanglements of violence, slavery, and medicine.While there is no record of the painting of Sims and Lucy being displayed at the Capitol, a separate painting showing Sims standing near Westcott and calling him one of the “medical giants of Alabama,” was on display at the University of Alabama-Birmingham before being removed in 2006. In 2017, Dr. Vanessa Gamble — a physician and historian at George Washington University — reaffirmed in a radio interview that Sims performed thirty surgeries on Westcott alone in the course of his experimentation, which was conducted without anesthesia:There was a belief at the time that black people did not feel pain in the same way. They were not vulnerable to pain, especially black women. So that they had suffered pain in other parts of their lives and their pain was ignored.Sims is credited with discovering a surgical technique that could repair the condition known as vesicovaginal fistula, as well as the first successful gallbladder surgery, and the first artificial insemination procedure that resulted in a pregnancy, although it resulted in a miscarriage and was described by The Atlantic as “an ethical nightmare.”While there is no painting of Sims at the Alabama State Capitol, a statue of him first erected there in 1939 still stands, despite calls for its removal. A separate statue honoring Sims in New York City was taken down in April 2018. A separate monument to Sims is still on display outside the State House in his native South Carolina.Comments",false,"Fact Checks, Politics"

The national coin shortage was done intentionally, the mint is no longer releasing coins into circulation aka this is the beginning of the end of paper money,"" the July 2 post says in part, arguing it’s part of a decades-old plan toward enabling a ""soon coming one world government"" to track every private transaction. ""First it will be coins, then one dollar bills and in a not so distant future cash will not be accepted at any store."" The post includes what appears to be a photograph of a sign inside of a grocery store that says: ""Our country is experiencing a national coin shortage"" and asking customers to use exact change or non-cash forms of payment. Some commenters posted images of what appear to be retail store signs with similar messages. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found there was a coronavirus-induced shortage of coins, but no evidence of a plan to eradicate pocket change. Many news outlets reported in June that across the country, coins were hard to find. ""Coins have become scarce as virus lockdowns keep people from emptying their coin jars in exchange for paper bills,"" the New York Times reported. ""The Latest Pandemic Shortage: Coins Are The New Toilet Paper,"" said NPR, describing how banks were running low on nickels, dimes and quarters, in turn leading to shortages at retail outlets. ""With the partial closure of the economy, the flow of coins through the economy has gotten all…it’s kind of stopped,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told a House subcommittee. The Fed announced June 11 a ""strategic allocation of coin inventories,"" saying: ""The COVID‐19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the supply chain and normal circulation patterns for U.S. coin. In the past few months, coin deposits from depository institutions to the Federal Reserve have declined significantly and the U.S. Mint’s production of coin also decreased due to measures put in place to protect its employees."" The Fed also said it would work to ""maximize coin production capacity."" U.S. Mint spokesman Todd Martin told PolitiFact that in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, the Mint reduced the number of employees per shift in order to enhance social distancing, leading to a reduction in production of 10% in April and 20% in May. At the same time, reduced sales activity meant retailers were ordering more coins from the Mint because they were receiving fewer of them as people stayed home, he said. Coin production began to ramp up in May with mandatory Saturday overtime, the Mint returned to full production by mid-June, and nearly 1.6 billion coins were produced in June, Martin said. In short, the coin shortage was caused by reduced retail activity and a temporary reduction in production, both due to COVID-19.

Collins’ statement is accurate, but needs clarification and additional information.",Marc Filippino,"Things are getting tense among members of the General Assembly as Illinois continues its historic budget impasse. Democrats and Republicans are hurling attacks at opposition party leaders, hoping to assign blame for the state’s lack of a budget for 22 months. Republicans continue to target Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, while Democrats, like state Sen. Jacqueline Collins of Chicago, often slam Gov. Bruce Rauner. In a Feb. 24 newsletter from state Sen. Collins, she zeroes in on several of Rauner’s claims as she attempts to debunk them. One of her counterclaims said: ""Fact: Governor Rauner has called every year for eliminating funding for afterschool programs for at-risk youth, homeless prevention services and programs that help autistic children."" We wondered: Did Rauner actually call for the elimination of these programs each year he’s been in office? Budget proposals and vetoed bills We contacted Kenneth Lowe, a media and outreach specialist for the Illinois Senate Democratic Caucus, to see where the state senator found her sources. Lowe provided us with five instances from 2015 to 2017 in which the governor announced he intended to  freeze or cut homeless prevention, autism or after-school programs for at-risk youth. We looked into each instance to verify that it actually happened and to see whether it accurately depicts Collins’ claim. • Collins’ claim: On Feb. 18, 2015 Rauner announced his Fiscal Year 2016 budget in which he proposed freezing grant funding for autism and homeless prevention programs at DHS. He also called for the elimination of the After School Matters program at the Illinois State Board of Education. • Our finding: Rauner’s FY16 budget proposal shows the governor did look to freeze funding for homeless and autism programs, as well as cut After School Matters. • Collins’ claim: In April 2015, Rauner announced his plan to freeze funding for autism and homeless prevention. • Our findings: On April 3, 2015, Rauner did, in fact, call for a $26 million suspension in social services and public health grants. The Chicago Tribune reported, ""The Republican’s office released a list of targeted programs…that included funding to pay for…smoking cessation, teen programs, autism, and HIV and AIDS programs, among other things."" The Tribune story showed the governor called for a $1 million cut for autism programs, a $300,000 cut for Assistance for the Homeless and a $3.1 million cut to Teen REACH, an after-school program run by the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS) for high-risk youth. The cuts were dubbed by Democrats as the ""Good Friday Massacre"" and funding to the programs was restored a few weeks later when the administration reported higher-than-expected tax revenue. • Collins’ claim: In June 2015, Rauner vetoed a bill that would fund autism programs and homeless prevention programs. • Our finding: On June 25, 2015, Rauner vetoed HB4165. The bill would have provided $4.3 million to the Autism Diagnosis Education Program and $4.5 million to Homeless Youth Services. It is worth noting, however, that the bill was in a batch of 19 budget bills Rauner vetoed simultaneously under a single veto message that faulted Democrats for passing a budget that was $4 billion in the red. ""We must be partners in enacting a balanced budget that meets critical public needs within the resources available. The surest way to do that is by enacting structural reforms inside government and economic reforms that stimulate our economy and bring new jobs to Illinois,"" Rauner wrote in his veto message. As he has said repeatedly since then, Rauner, at the time, had said he would look to new revenue sources if the General Assembly enacted parts of his ""Turnaround Agenda."" This became the opening salvo in a budget impasse that endures to this day. • Collins’ claim: Governor Rauner’s FY17 budget proposal called for the same types of freezes and cuts from his FY16 budget proposal. • Our finding: Rauner’s budget did call for these freezes and cuts. The Project for Autism, DHS’ Homelessness Prevention program and After School Matter wouldn’t have received funding. • Collins’ claim: Rauner, again, introduced a budget without funding the above-mentioned programs. • Our finding: Rauner’s proposed FY18 budget shows this claim is correct. By looking at Rauner’s budget proposals, vetoed bills and past news stories we found Rauner has called for the elimination and freezing of funding for autism, homelessness and after school programs each year he has been in office. However, Rauner has not been successful in his attempts to eliminate or freeze this funding, a point Collins’ email does not make. 'It’s not pretty’ Chris Mooney, director of the Institute of Government & Public Affairs at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, said claims like the ones in Collins’ email are common these days. Illinois has been without a budget for almost two years, and Mooney said it’s starting to grate on people. ""People inside and outside the legislative process are having their nerves frayed,"" Mooney said. ""There’s a lot of tension, especially in the statehouse because they can’t get their jobs done. That’s frustrating for anybody."" Mooney said this feeling is probably amplified after the 12-bill budget package known as the ""Grand Bargain"" stalled. ""It was the one real attempt the (state) Senate had and it was shot down,"" Mooney said. ""It offered hope and those hopes were dashed. It’s like we’re starting back at square one.""

60,38318," The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has admitted that 98 million Americans were given cancer through polio shots contaminated with SV40, a cancer-causing virus found in monkeys. ","April 11, 2017",98 Million Americans Were Given Cancer Through Polio Shots,  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"Claims that 98 million Americans were given cancer through polio shots contaminated with SV40 from 1955 to 1963 are false. Questions about links between SV40 and cancer, and theories that millions of Americans were potentially exposed to SV40 through contaminated polio shots, have been circulating for years. Those rumors came to a head in a 2013 video posted at a YouTube channel operated by an Illinois-based team of paranormal investigators dubbed “Extremum Spiritum Paranormal.” The claim resurfaced in March 2017 with various posts on blog sites that espouse conspiracy theories about health news, world events, vaccines, and geology, just to name a few topics. First and foremost, the claim that 98 million Americans were given cancer through polio shots contaminated with SV40 from 1955 to 1963 are proven false by the very CDC information that these reports cite. The CDC reports that a total of 98 million people were given vaccines during that period — and that approximately 10-30 million Americans could have received a vaccine tainted with simian virus 40 (SV40). So, the number of people potentially impacted is far fewer than the 98 million total widely reported. Second, links between cancer and SV40 don’t appear to be supported by scientific research, the CDC reports: Some of the polio vaccine administered from 1955 to 1963 was contaminated with a virus called simian virus 40 (SV40). The virus came from the monkey kidney cells used to produce the vaccines. Once the contamination was discovered in the Salk inactivated polio vaccine in use at that time, the U.S. government established requirements for vaccine testing to verify that all new batches of the polio vaccine were free of SV40. Because of research done with SV40 in animal models, there was some concern that the virus could cause cancer. However, evidence suggests that SV40 has not caused cancer in humans. Despite initial fears that SV40 causes cancer in humans, a 2002 study cast doubt on those fears without disproving them completely. The New York Times reported in 2002 that SV40 had been found in the tumor cells taken from people who had four types of cancers that were found to develop in rodents — but it was not clear whether the virus caused those tumors: SV40 can cause cancer in rodents and in cultured human cells. It has been found in some tumors taken from cancer patients. But finding the virus in a tumor does not prove that it caused the tumor. Most large population studies have not found a higher cancer risk in people exposed to the vaccine. There is no blood test that can tell whether a person is infected with SV40, and there are no special steps to take to prevent the rare cancers being studied, researchers said. The report released yesterday was prepared by a 14-member committee on vaccine safety convened by the Institute of Medicine, which advises the government on public health. The report is the fifth in a series of eight that the government commissioned on vaccination. Fear of vaccine side effects has led some parents to shun vaccination, and outbreaks of diseases like whooping cough and measles have resulted, the report said. After analyzing more than 100 studies, the committee said that most evidence argued against a connection between the polio vaccine and cancers, but that those weaknesses in the studies made it impossible to dismiss the potential link. A review of links between SV40 and cancers in humans that was published in 2007 offered a more definitive analysis: “In summary, the most recent evidence does not support the notion that SV40 contributed to the development of human cancers.” In the end, claims that 98 million Americans were given cancer through polio shots are false, and scientific evidence doesn’t appear to support links between human cancer and SV40 that contaminated vaccines from 1955 to 1963. For those reasons, we’re calling this rumor “fiction.” Comments",false,Health / Medical
61,33865,"A stranger who stopped to change a tire on a disabled limo was rewarded for his efforts when the vehicle's passenger, Donald Trump, paid off his mortgage.","March 3, 1998","Even with a straight news story like this, a bit of manufactured memory has changed many people’s recall of the event. There are those who now swear they saw Donald Trump hand over an oversized, Ed McMahon-type check on TV. Likely this “Publisher’s Clearing House” mental image fits in better with our notion of how a celebrity would reward an ordinary fellow, hence the substituted memory.",Snopes Staff,"Reputed to have come from Donald Trump’s publicity people, the following tale found its way into the news media via the magazine Forbes in February 1996: This may well be the public relations gesture of the year. During the 1995 Christmas holidays, Donald Trump and Marla Maples find themselves marooned in their stretch limo with a flat tire on a busy stretch of New Jersey highway. Finally, a passing motorist spots the limo in distress and offers to help the chauffeur change the tire. Driver says, sure. Before the re-tired limo rolls off, the darkened window rolls down and an effusive Trump asks what he and his wife can do to repay the favor. Just send my wife a big bouquet of flowers, says the guy, handing Trump a card with his wife’s name and their address. Two weeks later a gargantuan bouquet of orchids arrives with a card reading, “We paid off your home mortgage, Marla and Donald.” The Trumps flackery won’t reveal the lucky chap’s name, but Informer hears Trump forked over more than $100,000 for the gesture. Eyebrows should have been raised by this tale, as even back in the mid-1990s it was already a recognized urban legend that had been told about many other celebrities. Casting doubt on the notion that it subsequently became a true legend was the lack of checkable details provided by Trump’s people, as exemplified by 1996 news reports that noted “The Trumps flackery won’t reveal the lucky chap’s name, but Informer hears Trump forked over more than $100,000 for the gesture.” Speaking plainly, we have an unsubstantiated rumor of celebrity good-deeding being spread by those who work for a man who courts the limelight at every opportunity. The tale’s details are fuzzy, too: one version has the event occurring while Donald Trump was married to Ivana and driving in Michigan, yet other versions place it during his marriage to Marla and had him driving in New Jersey or in Canada near Casino Niagara. In every case what’s lacking is confirmation from the lad whose mortgage was paid, the limousine driver, or anyone who worked at the tire-changer’s bank (and would thus have been in on the mortgage’s retirement). Is it reasonable to assume someone so rewarded would fail to tell his family, friends, and co-workers about his encounter with a famous millionaire, especially the part about the wealthy one’s repaying a small kindness in so overwhelming a fashion? Is it reasonable that his wife would similarly remain silent? If you think not, you should be asking why the tire-changer’s name is still unknown, why his story didn’t escape into the community where he lives and from there make its way to the media, why you’ve yet to see so much as one televised interview with him. In fact, back in 1997, when the Donald Trump version of the tale was still relatively new, Trump’s office was actively denying its truthfulness: The implausible story making the rounds at Toronto doughnut shops is that somebody’s newphew’s friend’s cousin, Joe, was driving down Highway 401 in his pickup truck when he spotted a white stretch limousine, with its hood up, on the shoulder. Joe, being a good samaritan, stopped to help. Within minutes, he got the limo running and a grateful driver asked for Joe’s card so he could send him a little something. “Nah,” Joe said. “It was nothing. I was just trying to be helpful.” The driver insisted, so Joe gave him a card and forgot about it. A week later, he got a call from his bank informing him that his $160,000 mortgage had been paid off by Donald Trump, who was a passenger in the limo. “We’ve heard the story,” said an irritated-sounding assistant of Mr. Trump’s at his New York office. “No, it isn’t true.” The story also fails the plausibility check: wouldn’t the driver of the limousine be able to change a tire on his own, or at least be able to make a cell phone call to AAA for assistance with a minor mechanical problem? Trump’s first wife, Ivana, could — and indeed did — change a tire when sidelined with a flat, making it all the more surprising Trump’s chauffeur lacked this skill yet apparently kept his job (especially in light of his employer’s notorious impatience with those who fail to perform). Gulling a number of people was The Donald’s own confirmation of the tale during a January 2005 episode of his television series, The Apprentice. When asked about the veracity of this legend by one of those vying for the show’s ultimate prize, Trump simply responded, “That’s true.” For many, his saying so was all the proof that mattered. Yet he is far from the first celebrity to claim an item of contemporary lore as an anecdote from his own life (see our page about the Hare Dryer legend for a number of such examples). Moreover, news accounts from 2016 revealed that Trump had long been posing as a publicist to brag about himself, and he has a decades-old reputation for being less than truthful about himself, as illustrated by this excerpt from a 1997 New Yorker article: Alair Townsend, a former deputy mayor in the Koch administration, once quipped, “I wouldn’t believe Donald Trump if his tongue were notarized.” In time, this bon mot became misattributed to Leona Helmsley, who was only too happy to claim authorship. Last fall [1996] after Evander Holyfield upset Mike Tyson in a heavyweight title fight, Trump snookered the News into reporting that he’d collected twenty million bucks by betting a million on the underdog. This prompted the Post to make calls to some Las Vegas bookies who confirmed — shockingly! — that nobody had been handling that kind of action or laying odds close to 20-1. Trump never blinked, just moved on to the next bright idea. The legend of the good Samaritan, the disabled car, and the celebrity’s generosity has been told of others over the years. It’s a classic windfall legend. Each of us would like to believe an ordinary kindness on our part would result in manna from heaven falling our way, which is why this legend speaks directly to us. We can see ourselves on the receiving end of all those golden goodies, and it reaffirms our faith in the world in that we want to believe good deeds don’t go unrewarded. Oscar Wilde used a similar plot for his 1891 short story “A Model Millionaire.” In it, Hughie is a lad who has stopped to visit an artist friend. He is momentarily left alone in the company of the wretch the painter is using as his model and is touched by the old man’s tattered appearance. He slips the beggar a gold sovereign, realizing it’s all the mad money he has for the month but that the elderly fellow needs it so much more than he does. The beggar smiles, pockets the coin, and thanks Hughie. We later discover the beggar is in reality Baron Hausberg, a millionaire who for no clearly stated reason enjoys posing for this particular artist. The Baron sends a wedding gift of £10,000 to Hughie as his way of thanking the young man who was moved to help an unfortunate. We also found a Henry Ford version of this legend in a 1954 collection of inspirational tales: Honk-honk, honk-honk, honk-honk-honk. The old-fashioned horn was bellowing as the mechanical contraption came around the bend and rushed along the dusty road. The engine was roaring and the radiator hissing as the long-suffering warrior did twenty-five miles per hour. It was one of the earliest Ford cars; the Methuselah of engineering. Men said it would never die a natural death: it would either commit suicide or be smashed by modern unpredictables. Honk-honk, chug-chug-chug; and the wizened old farmer, with a thick growth of beard darkening his chin, steered his car homeward. Suddenly, ahead of him he saw a beautiful car drawn up by the roadside. It was an immaculate product of modern engineering. Long and low, its lines were fascinating; but it was at a standstill! As the farmer drew nearer he recognized that some kind of engine trouble had interrupted the progress of the other travellers. The shining bonnet of the beautiful car had been lifted, and the chauffeur, with cap pushed well back on his head, was perplexedly staring at the unresponsive engine. With a sound of squealing brakes the old car was brought to a halt, and as a rusty door swung open, the farmer came out to ask, “What’s wrong?” The stranger responded, “I don’t know. The engine has stopped.” The newcomer looked inside the bonnet, and then announced his readiness to tow the car to the garage seven miles away. The stranded driver casually lifted his eyebrows and answered, “You’ll tow me to the garage!” What with? That!” And his finger indicated the noisy model T. The farmer’s chest expanded, and he seemed about to explode; but the eruption died, and he answered, “Yes, with that. You’ll see.” He lifted a rope from the back of his car, placed it in position, and said, “Now get in, and I’ll show you.” Slowly the great car was taken along the roads, and finally, as the garage came into view, the farmer smiled and prepared to stop. “Well! She did it, didn’t she?” The two drivers were then joined by a third man, who all the while had been sitting in the back of the broken-down limousine. Quietly he asked, “What do I owe you, sir?” The farmer’s eyes narrowed as he repeated, “What do you owe? Nothing. It’s a ____ of a do if we can’t help each other without being paid for it. No. Nothing. Pleased to help you. Good day.” He coiled his rope, climbed into the driving seat, and soon disappeared in a cloud of dust. The silent passenger calmly watched his departure, and then smiled. He nodded and quietly repeated to himself, “It’s a ____ of a do if we can’t help each other without being paid for it.” In due course the wheezy, asthmatical model T reached the end of its career. It has not been placed on record whether the end came suddenly, or whether the closing months were marred by internal disorders. The fact is that the old car succumbed to the ravages of time, and was given a respectable funeral in the junk yard. The day after the ceremony, the bereaved farmer was somewhat astounded to find a new Ford car standing a few yards from his door. The old man paused. Had someone called? No! He rubbed his eyes; the car was so new, so glossy, so desirable. He walked around it, and then opened the door to inspect the interior. He saw a message written on a label tied to the steering wheel. “It’s a ____ of a do if we can’t help each other without being paid for it.” The passenger who had offered in vain to pay for the towing of his car had been the great manufacturer — Henry Ford. Probably he had been fascinated by the achievement of one of his earlier models, and when its proud owner refused remuneration, he thought of another way to pay his debt. Probably he commissioned the garage owner to keep watch, and when the old model T ceased to function, to present, with Henry Ford’s compliments, a new car to the kind-hearted farmer. In 1989 the variation of the moment of the unrecognized celebrity rescued by a Samaritan starred Mrs. Nat King Cole. Car troubles supposedly stranded her on the shoulder of a Los Angeles freeway, and she was said to have rewarded the kind man who stopped to render assistance with a new car (variously reported as a Cadillac, Lincoln, or Rolls-Royce.) In 1997 a version of the Mrs. Nat King Cole legend tied to the death of her husband was circulating on the Internet. It appears to have been lifted word for word from the 1997 book Chicken Soup for the Woman’s Soul: One night, at 11:30 PM, an older African-American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had broken down, and she desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car. A young white man stopped to help her — generally unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s. The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi cab. She seemed to be in a big hurry! However, she wrote down his address, thanked him, and drove away. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man’s door. To his surprise, a giant combination console color TV and stereo record player were delivered to his home. A special note was attached. The note read:  Dear Mr. James: Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my clothes but my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able to make it to my dying husband’s bedside just before he passed away. God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others. Sincerely, Mrs. Nat King Cole.” Though it’s a lovely story, it too didn’t happen. Nat King Cole died of lung cancer at dawn on 15 February 1965 in Santa Monica, California. He was hospitalized in December 1964, and on 25 January 1965 his left lung was removed. At least from the date of his operation until his death, Maria Cole was with him every day. There was no opportunity for her to have been stranded in the rain beside an Alabama highway in the weeks leading up to her husband’s death. She was sitting with him when he passed away, and none of the newspapers that commented on her vigil made mention of a last-minute dash to the hospital, an automotive breakdown, or a helpful Samaritan who got her there in time. Another version of the car breakdown legend gives the famous person as Perry Como and has him mailing his rescuer a set of keys to a new car. This tale is told as happening all over the place, so I wonder at Perry’s ability to buy all these people cars but not provide himself with reliable transportation. Yet another twist has the disabled car story happening to Como’s wife, and the payoff she provides is either a color TV or tickets to her husband’s upcoming concert. It’s also told of Mrs. Leon Spinks, and the reward she grants are tickets to her hubby’s upcoming fight in New Orleans. (Moral of the story: if you want the big ticket items, don’t settle for rescuing the wife of a celebrity; hold out for the man himself.) In February 2000, a version starring Bill Gates began circulating on the Internet: Apparently a couple returning home from a skiing trip in British Columbia spots a disabled car at the side of the road and a man in distress. Being good citizens they stop to help. The car has either a flat tire and the Good Samaritan fixes it quickly. The man was very grateful, but had no cash with him to reward them, so asked for their name and address so he could send them a little something. A week later the couple receives a call from their banker stating that their mortgage had been paid and $10,000 had been deposited in their account by a very grateful Bill Gates. Getting back to Donald Trump, we find that on at least one verifiable occasion he’s known to have bestowed largesse on a helpful stranger. Trump’s 79-year-old mother was mugged in 1991, suffering broken bones and severe facial bruises. A passing truck driver who witnessed the assault brought down the mugger and handed him over to justice. (The robber was later sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison). The Donald had dinner with the rescuer, his sister, and his son; offered the Samaritan a better job; and gave him a check for an undisclosed amount.",false,"Politics Politicians, donald trump"
63,27177,The Trump Administration’s policies have halted a research effort seeking a cure for HIV.,"December 11, 2018","Greene told us that after much internal debate, he and Hasenkrug plan on running that initial experiment anyway, with the hopes that the political climate will change in their favor come January 2019.",Alex Kasprak,"In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that they would be canceling a contract with a company called Advanced Bioscience Resources Inc. (ABR) to procure fetal tissue for federal medical research projects. The department alleged that they were not “sufficiently assured that the contract included the appropriate protections applicable to fetal tissue research or met all other procurement requirements.” Using this development as pretext, HHS announced that they would additionally be conducting “a comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue to ensure consistency with statutes and regulations governing such research, and to ensure the adequacy of procedures and oversight of this research in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved” — in effect putting a “pause” on all research that relied on fetal tissue. ABR supplied fetal tissue to two National Institutes of Health [NIH] laboratories, one of which uses the material to create what are known as humanized mice. In a broad sense, these mice have been bred, with the help of fetal human tissue, to express a human immune response, making them a cost-effective way to test the efficacy of immunotherapeutic drugs:  Such mice are particularly valuable for HIV drug testing in part because tissue from a single human fetus can readily generate a group of 40 to 50 genetically identical mice, and because the animals can, unlike monkeys, be infected with the human virus, HIV. Potential drugs can then be tested in such a group, with ample mice as controls, giving the studies robust statistical power. ABR had been the supplier of fetal tissue to NIH’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Montana, which had been using humanized mice to test potential HIV therapies. In a grant report on that laboratory’s efforts to study HIV using humanized-mouse models during the 2016 fiscal year, NIH scientist Kim Hasenkrug indicated strong potential for their research methods to aid in the search for new treatments for HIV:  Experiments in FY2016 revealed that our … humanized mouse model can be used in long-term studies (up to one year) with [Antiretroviral Therapy, ART] administered by injections or via an oral route (drugs incorporated into mouse chow). Such mice develop chronic and latent HIV infections. We have demonstrated that HIV viral loads in these mice can be suppressed to levels undetectable by highly sensitive PCR tests for viremia and provirus. Warner Greene, the director of the Gladstone Center for HIV Cure Research in San Francisco, had been collaborating with RML to test potential antibody therapies on humanized mice, and he first told Science that the HHS “pause” on fetal tissue procurement meant that the researchers could not guarantee enough mice to complete a statistically robust study. In a phone call, he explained to us that:  What happened in September was that my NIH collaborator at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories [Kim Hasenkrug] was informed that he could no longer order fetal tissue from the sole source supplier, ABR, and so we [were told that we] could complete the [initial] experiment that [had already been set up], but in science you need to do multiple experiments. You can’t depend upon one experiment to see whether it’s repeatable, etc. So essentially this ban on fetal tissue stopped the line of investigation. Speaking to Science, Greene said that “Hasenkrug had not yet launched the experiment, and [RML’s] supplies of existing mice were too small to conduct the repeated experiments required to reach convincing scientific conclusions.” In a 9 December 2018 statement provided to Science after the publication’s original 7 December 2018 reporting, HHS acknowledged that they had (at least temporarily) blocked staff scientists from procuring fetal tissue, but that they did not think — or realize — such a move would have affected the study in question:  [In their statement, the NIH] said the agency in September “put a pause in place” for staff scientists procuring new human fetal tissue, “an action NIH thought was prudent given the examination of these procurements. Research with tissue already on hand could proceed, and NIH leaders asked to be notified by intramural investigators if new procurement would be necessary. NIH leadership was not informed that new procurement was necessary for the study you reference in your [7 December 2018 Science story]. We are looking into why this did not occur.”  In his interview with us, Greene stated that this explanation made no sense. “To my knowledge … we were never made aware that we should approach the NIH to inform them of our need for more fetal tissue to complete this investigation.” If such a request were required, Greene said, he and his team would have “acted upon it in a millisecond.” We also reached out to the director of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which oversees the Rocky Mountain Laboratory) for an update on the current status of the project and for clarification on the fetal tissue review’s impact on the study but have not received a response. However, as HHS has acknowledged both that they “put a pause in place” on fetal tissue procurement, and that this pause resulted in the inability of a trial seeking an HIV cure to move forward, it is factual to state that the Trump administration’s policies shut down (at least temporarily) scientists’ efforts to find a cure for HIV. Greene told us that NIH has been extremely supportive of their work, and that he feels that this change is “clearly a policy that’s … reflective of a new political situation in Washington, D.C., that’s now impacting our science.” Greene is one of many who viewed the 24 September announcement regarding fetal tissue research as a proxy debate over abortion. Chronologically, the announcement that the federal government would cut ties with ABR followed a campaign by several anti-abortion groups who explicitly sought to have the government cancel its contract with ABR, as reported in Science:  On 11 September, 45 anti-abortion groups wrote to HHS Secretary Alex Azar that they were “shocked and dismayed” by the FDA contract [with ABR]. On 17 September, 85 members of Congress wrote a similar letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb asking him to cancel the contract. Reacting to HHS’s actions [on 24 September], Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said: “My instinct is that this is driven by politics, and is part of the overall effort to stigmatize and eventually criminalize abortion, as well as part of a larger campaign to roll back the clock on sexual and reproductive rights.”",true,"Politics, abortion, fetal tissue, HIV"
64,1914,Judge blocks graphic cigarette warnings.,"November 7, 2011","A federal judge blocked a rule requiring tobacco companies to display graphic images on cigarette packs, such as a man exhaling cigarette smoke through a hole in his throat.","Alina Selyukh, Jeremy Pelofsky","Combination picture of new graphic cigarette packages, released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration June 21, 2011, shows a varied collection of a man on a ventilator, diseased lungs and dead bodies were among the graphic images for revamped U.S. tobacco labels, unveiled by health officials who hope the warnings will help smokers quit. REUTERS/U.S. Food and Drug Administration/Handout District Judge Richard Leon sided on Monday with tobacco companies and granted a temporary injunction, saying they would likely prevail in their lawsuit challenging the requirement as unconstitutional because it compels speech in violation of the First Amendment. The Food and Drug Administration in June released nine new warnings to go into effect in September of 2012, the first change in U.S. cigarette warning labels in 25 years. Cigarette packs already carry text warnings from the U.S. Surgeon General. The new warnings must cover the top half of the front and back of cigarette packs and 20 percent of printed advertisements and must contain color graphics depicting the health consequences of smoking, including diseased lungs, dead bodies and rotting teeth. Congress instructed FDA to impose the new labels as part of 2009 legislation making the agency responsible for regulating tobacco products. “The sheer size and display requirements for the graphic images are anything but narrowly tailored,” Leon wrote in a 29-page opinion. Just because Congress ordered the size and placement of the new warnings before charging the FDA with carrying out the mandate, “doing so does not enable this requirement to somehow automatically pass constitutional muster,” he said. The content of the images would also not likely survive constitutional muster because the FDA did not attempt to narrowly tailor those either, the judge said. The tobacco lawsuit is the latest effort by corporations to assert a right to free speech, a high-profile legal battle that could end up before the Supreme Court. Reynolds American Inc’s R.J. Reynolds unit, Lorillard Inc, Liggett Group LLC and Commonwealth Brands Inc, owned by Britain’s Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, sued the FDA in August. They argued the new graphic warnings force them to “engage in anti-smoking advocacy” on the government’s behalf, breaching their right to free speech. The Obama administration’s options include appealing Leon’s ruling or the FDA could try to rewrite the rules. FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Yao said the agency did not comment on proposed, pending or ongoing litigation. Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller said the department was aware of the decision and was reviewing it. Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States, accounting for one in every five deaths every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 21 percent of U.S. adults smoke cigarettes, a number little changed since 2004. Worldwide, tobacco kills nearly 6 million people every year, including more than 600,000 nonsmokers, according to the World Health Organization, which has repeatedly called for graphic images to appear on tobacco packs, saying the pictorial warnings actually work. The tobacco industry had asked Leon to block the FDA’s new requirements, pending a final decision on their constitutionality. They argued they needed a quick ruling because they would have to start in November or December and spend millions of dollars to comply with the requirements. Justice Department attorneys had argued that the money was a small fraction of the companies’ net sales, so they would not suffer irreparable harm without the temporary injunction. Government attorneys said the labels conveyed the dangers of smoking more effectively than words alone, and were needed to stop more people from smoking, especially teenagers. Judge Leon said the images provoked an emotional response rather than just providing factual and noncontroversial information, crossing the line into using company advertising for government advocacy. Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment lawyer representing Lorillard, called Leon’s ruling a “vindication for the well-established First Amendment principle that the government may not compel speech in the commercial area.”   He said the case was in its early stages and there was a “good chance” it will eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court. The Dow Jones tobacco index, whose components include Altria, Lorillard and Reynolds American, was just 0.05 percent higher in afternoon trading amid mixed trading for broader U.S. stock indexes as investors kept a worried eye on European debt problems.

The post, shared by United Kingdom-based Daily Mail, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline exaggerates what happened and raises alarm over the possibility that Trump has been exposed to coronavirus. Based on current reporting, that’s not what we know. A Daily Mail spokesman told us the post would be edited to make it clearer. Indeed, before we published this check, they changed it to read, ""The chairman of the American Conservative Union has revealed that he interacted with a 55-year-old man infected with coronavirus before shaking hands with Donald Trump."" Let’s take a look. The Daily Mail post includes a looping video clip of Trump on stage at CPAC and shaking hands with a white-haired man before taking the lectern for his speech. Trump spoke on the final day of that conference, which was sponsored by the American Conservative Union and held in National Harbor, Md., Feb. 26-29, 2020. The words that appear as the Daily Mail video plays state that the man, identified as the CPAC chairman, said he had ""interacted with an infected man recovering in New Jersey"" before greeting Trump. On March 7, 2020, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced that someone who’d traveled to the state Feb. 27-March 1 for the conference was confirmed to have COVID-19. ""Those who attended or worked at the conference may be at some risk for acquiring COVID-19,"" Hogan’s statement read. The next day, March 8, 2020, the Washington Post reported the following: The man Trump shook hands with is Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and CPAC. Schlapp said he briefly interacted personally early in the four-day conference with a man infected with the coronavirus. The man has not been identified. Schlapp said he used hand sanitizer regularly during the conference and had not had any symptoms before or after shaking hands with Trump. He said he has been in touch with his own doctor and with the infected patient, who is being quarantined in New Jersey. The White House has maintained that Trump was never in direct contact with the infected person and does not have any symptoms. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., said in a statement on March 8, 2020, that he ""briefly interacted"" with the infected person while at CPAC and would self-quarantine at his Texas home ""out of an abundance of caution."" Rep. Paul A. Gosar, R-Ariz., tweeted that same day that he and three of his staff members are under self-quarantine ""after sustained contact at CPAC"" with the person who has the virus. Schlapp told the New York Times he had had incidental contact with the infected person. The Times reported March 9, 2020, that the man, a 55-year-old New Jersey resident, was in stable condition in a hospital. As for the spread of coronavirus, we’ve reported that: Older people and those with preexisting health conditions are more at risk of developing complications from the coronavirus. For the American public, the immediate risk of coronavirus remains relatively low. The best ways to prevent the spread of the virus are to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, cover your sneezes and coughs, and disinfect your home.

Trump shook hands with Matt Schlapp, a man who says he had been in contact days earlier with someone who is reportedly being treated for the virus. Schlapp says he has had no symptoms of the illness. Some may argue third-hand contact indicates possible exposure for Trump, but such a conclusion ignores available evidence. While the Daily Mail did qualify its assertion by using the word ""potential"" in ""potential coronavirus sufferer,"" the headline (which ended in an exclamation point) nevertheless led readers to believe that Trump’s exposure is worthy of alarm.

68,24601,"The Democrat-backed health care reform plan ""will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars.","August 7, 2009",Boehner says Democrats' health care plan would subsidize abortions,Robert Farley,"In an already contentious health care debate, the last thing the Obama administration wants is a fight over abortion. The word ""abortion"" was never mentioned in the initial health care plans released by the House and Senate. The decision of whether to offer abortion coverage in the proposed public plan, then, would be left up to the health and human services secretary. Abortion opponents said that would allow Democrats to slip abortion into the plan as part of the standard coverage. In an op-ed piece on July 23, House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio repeated the concerns of many who oppose abortion that the Democratic-backed health care reform plan ""will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars."" Although there are several versions of the health care bill kicking around in Congress, one thing has now become clear: Most envision a government-run health plan option that could include abortion coverage, as well as a health care exchange in which participating private insurance companies would be permitted to offer such coverage. But does that mean that federal tax dollars would be used to subsidize abortions? That's a more difficult question. Let's back up a minute and explain some background: Currently, the 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees. President Barack Obama gave a nod to that precedent when asked in a July 21 CBS interview with Katie Couric whether he favored a government option that would cover abortions. Obama said, ""As you know, I'm prochoice. But I think we also have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care. Rather than wade into that issue at this point, I think that it's appropriate for us to figure out how to just deliver on the cost savings, and not get distracted by the abortion debate at this station."" Abortion opponents had hoped similar restrictions to those in the Hyde Amendment would be placed on any government-run health care option, and also be extended to any private insurance companies that participate in the government-sponsored health care exchange, which will provide health insurance for people who don't get it through their employer. To that end, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., offered an amendment to the House health care proposal that would prohibit the use of public money ""to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion."" The amendment was narrowly defeated. Donna Crane, policy director for NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Stupak's proposal a ""radical departure from the status quo,"" because millions of women who currently have private insurance plans that cover abortions would be stripped of that coverage if their plan ultimately became part of the exchange — which seems likely. According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women currently have health insurance that covers abortions. And so began the debate over how to make the health care reform bill ""abortion neutral."" A compromise plan offered by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., which passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee, seeks to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents — particularly the issue of tax dollars being used to subsidize abortions — while specifically making abortion coverage available in both the public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange. Under the Capps amendment: • Abortion coverage would not be part of the required minimum benefits package. In other words, insurers would not be required to offer, or be prohibited from offering, abortion services in order to participate in the exchange. • The public plan could include abortion coverage, but the cost of the additional coverage could not be paid through public subsidies (tax dollars), only through the premiums paid by the insured. And with private plans in the exchange, again, federal subsidies could not be used for abortion coverage. • Public funding would only be permitted for abortions allowed under the Hyde Amendment — in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger. • At least one plan in every region must offer full abortion coverage; and one must not. • Any insurance plan participating in the exchange cannot discriminate against hospitals or other health care facilities (such as Catholic hospitals) that are unwilling to provide abortions. • The plan will not pre-empt any state laws regarding abortion, such as parental notification laws. Douglas Johnson, legislative director for National Right to Life, said the amendment is hardly a compromise, and the pledge not to prohibit the use of public funds amounts to little more than symbolic bookkeeping. The Capps amendment may claim to segregate funds used for abortions, he said, but the bottom line is you have the government paying subsidies to people who are then able to obtain abortion coverage. And, he said, ""It's still the government running the whole plan."" ""The government would be participating in the killing of unborn children under the guise of a health care plan,"" Johnson said. But that's not the opinion of all antiabortion groups. Chris Korzen, executive director of Catholics United, which opposes abortion, said his group doesn't want to see an important health care plan derailed by a ""misleading campaign"" that claims the health care plan would mean taxpayer-subsidized abortions. ""The goal should be to maintain the current policies,"" Korzen said. ""That Capps amendment accomplishes just that. It specifically prohibits taxpayers' funding of abortions. It disappoints me that there are people who are still making that claim."" And, he said, ""there's a lot to be happy about,""  including the fact that abortion coverage was not included as part of the required minimum benefits package. Crane said NARAL believes abortion should be treated like any other health service. But they think the Capps amendment at least maintains the status quo, and that it helped to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents. ""We thought they got everything they wanted,"" Crane said. ""We are confused why they continue to push."" Obviously, there's a lot at stake in the health care bill for both sides in the abortion debate. The fact that several versions of the health care reform bill are floating around Congress makes it difficult to say with certainty what the final plan will or will not include. But while it appears likely the plan would allow for the coverage of abortions, we don't see anything in the plans that would require taxpayers to foot the bill for that. In fact, in a key version of the bill — the one passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee — members went to great pains to include an amendment to ensure that federal money is not used for abortion coverage. Again, things could change as the health reform package works its way through Congress, but for now, we don't see anything to support Boehner's claim that taxpayers would subsidize abortions.

(To check our sources and find additional information, go to the extended version of this article at PolitiFactRI.com.)",John Hill,"Rhode Island was treated to an interesting do-the-ends-justify-the-means debate last week when the Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine criticized a research study by Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University that uses young pigs to study the effects of alcohol consumption on the heart. Besides objecting to the treatment of the animals involved, the committee argued that the money spent on such research could be better used elsewhere in the Ocean State. To drive that point home, the committee has begun an advertising campaign with posters on five Providence bus shelters, claiming ""Rhode Island’s teen binge drinking rate is double the national average. But Brown researchers are not helping teens. Instead, they are wasting federal funds on experiments giving alcohol to piglets."" We’ll pass on whether getting pigs drunk is a waste of federal money. But we wondered whether Rhode Island’s rate of teen binge drinking is that high. Two federal agencies that track teenage alcohol use, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, define binge drinking as having five or more drinks at the same occasion, at the same time or within a couple of hours. Physicians Committee spokeswoman Jeanne S. McVey said the group came up with its statistic by using data from two federal agencies that track, among other things, alcohol use by the nation’s teenagers. She cited a 2012 survey by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration that found that 7.2 percent of respondents aged 12 to 17 nationwide reported at least one instance of binge drinking over the previous 30 days. But that study didn’t break down its findings by state. For a Rhode Island number, McVey said, the committee turned to a 2013 survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Study, a survey of a cross section of the nation’s high school students, done every two years. According to documents posted on the state Health Department website, that survey found that in Rhode Island, 15.1 percent of responding students in grades 9 through 12 said they had at least one binge-drinking experience in the previous 30 days. Rhode Island’s 15.1 percent, as reported in the CDC study, is more than twice the national average of 7.2 percent, as reported in the SAMHSA study, McVey said. But those are numbers from two different studies. Is it legitimate to compare them in that way? No, said statistician Jeffrey E. Jarrett, a professor of finance decision science at the University of Rhode Island. To be valid, Jarrett said, comparisons must be drawn from the same data -- in other words, surveys that ask the same questions to the same people. Even a slight difference in wording between questionnaires can make a difference. ""The only way to compare is to compare things within the same study,"" he said. To get an apples-to-apples comparison, we returned to the CDC study. The agency has not yet compiled national averages for its 2013 study. But in its 2011 survey, the Rhode Island teen binge-drinking rate was 18.3 percent, compared with 21.9 percent for the nation as a whole. So the Rhode Island rate was actually less than the national one, not double. When we pointed out the flaws in the committee’s methodology, McVey acknowledged that the organization could have been more careful. ""We now see that we should have had an expert in statistics double check, because we were comparing one set of national statistics to one set of local statistics,"" McVey said. "" … If we were to do it over again, we would certainly word it differently."" ""Our larger point is true,"" she added. ""Federal funds should go to helping people rather than to animal experiments that often do not result in treatment for human patients.""

70,590,New Delhi declares public emergency as pollution at year's worst.,"March 30, 2016",Authorities in New Delhi declared a public health emergency on Friday and closed schools and all construction activity until next week as air pollution in the city hit its worst level this year.,Neha Dasgupta,"A thick haze has hung over the Indian capital this week caused by plumes of toxic smoke from farm fires raging in neighbouring states. An index measuring the level of a deadly air pollutant hit 484 on a scale of 500 on Friday, the government’s Central Pollution Control Board, the worst this year. The index measures the level of PM 2.5, tiny particulate matter that goes deep into the lungs. Anything above 400 poses a risk for people with respiratory illnesses and can also affect even those with healthy lungs. Some companies advised employees to avoid exposure to toxic air and work from home. “We have been advised to stay at home on Monday,” said Anuj Rawat, an account director at Kantar, the market research arm of British advertising major WPP. Kantar employs around 400 people at its office in New Delhi, Rawat said. The Environment Pollution Control Authority, which is leading the effort to tackle Delhi’s pollution, said: “We have to take this as a public health emergency as air pollution is now hazardous and will have adverse health impacts on all, but particularly our children.”  It banned all construction work in the sprawling metropolis of 20 million people and its neighbouring cities until Nov. 5. Each year, farmers in the states of Punjab and Haryana burn crop residue to prepare for the sowing season, ignoring  government warnings. According to government-run monitor SAFAR, satellite pictures had captured nearly 3,200 incidents of stubble burning on Thursday in Haryana and Punjab that contributed to 44% percent of Delhi’s pollution. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal offered free masks on Friday and ordered schools shut till Nov. 5 to protect children. The toxic air has left several Bangladeshi cricket players with sore throats and itchy eyes ahead of their Twenty20 match against India on Sunday. “Government knew an emergency situation was approaching and did not take substantive steps on stubble burning or big industrial polluting sources,” said Sunil Dahiya, an energy and air pollution analyst at Greenpeace. “A public health emergency situation began at least 10 days ago.”",true,Environment
71,2581,"Sun, sand and root canal: Medical tourism booms in Costa Rica.","November 26, 2012","When Canadian house cleaner Marlene Trithardt needed a tooth replaced, she drove past her local dentist’s office in Alberta and flew to the beach paradise of Costa Rica - to save money.",Isabella Cota,"Trithardt is one of a growing number of North Americans who turn south for medical care lured by lower prices, contributing close to 0.8 percent of Costa Rica’s gross domestic product. “I chose to come here because I find in Alberta the prices are about 80 percent higher than in Costa Rica,” says Trithardt, 57, who makes $30,000 a year. Her treatment will cost $4,000. But even including airfare, hotels and meals for two weeks, the total amount is lower than the $10,000 she said she was expecting to pay for the dental care alone in Canada. In the bargain, Trithardt got to take a few days to visit Costa Rica’s national parks. Around 40,000 medical tourists visited Costa Rica last year, compared to 36,000 in 2010 and 30,000 in 2009. Most of them are American and Canadian, according to the country’s tourism institute, ICT. Of that number, almost 15,000 of them traveled for dental care, said Massimo Manzi, director at Promed, the council for international promotion of medicine in Costa Rica. Manzi estimates that medical tourism brought in $196 million to Costa Rica’s health industry in 2011, with patients spending an additional $84 million in hotels, meals, travel and shopping. That makes for a total of $280 million spent on medical tourism in 2011, compared to $252 million in 2010. Costa Rica competes for medical tourists with the likes of India, Brazil, Panama and Mexico, and its proximity to the United States gives it an advantage over Asian and South American destinations. And while some doctors in the United States discourage traveling abroad for cheaper treatment - saying the quality may not be vetted and that follow-up care is lacking - technology and care standards in the private sector are perceived by the medical community and patients alike to be high. The dental tourism niche is booming in Costa Rica, a country of 4.5 million people best known for its white sand beaches and lush rainforests. Now accounting for 36 percent of all medical tourism, that figure is seen rising to 50 percent over the next two years, said Promed’s Manzi. Trithardt’s doctor, 32-year-old Costa Rican Ignacio Vargas, says tourists represent 70 percent of his business. Virtually all medical tourists are uninsured and pay their own way, said Brad Cooke, head of Medical Tours Costa Rica, a travel agency that works exclusively with patients. As a result, healthcare reform passed in the United States that will require Americans to get basic insurance by 2014 could reduce demand. However that reform does not cover dental care. “We had a gentleman, for example, who was interested in coming in for a knee procedure about six months ago and then he decided not to come. He said he’d rather wait and see if Obamacare would cover it”, said Cooke. A few insurance companies in the U.S. like Cigna Corp, Satori and Blue Cross Blue Shield are already expanding their supplier network to include overseas clinics and facilities to help cut costs. “What we’re hoping, and it would be an important step, is that these insurance companies offer an incentive to those who choose the international option,” Manzi said. Costa Rican health officials are grappling with booming demand as it is. “We are learning how to handle this demand so that we don’t get to a point where we are facing waiting periods which would turn patients away from Costa Rica,” said Health Minister Daisy Corrales. To help ensure that demand can be met, Promed works as a guide for investors looking to build new clinics and hospitals that can welcome tourist-patients.",true,Health News

Demi was one of 10 dogs rescued on Tuesday from a farm in Wonju, 90 km (55 miles) from the South Korean capital, Seoul,  where 200 dogs were being raised for human consumption, to start new lives as pets under the HSI’s campaign. The farm is the sixth that the group has helped close down in South Korea since 2015, and follows six-months of negotiations, medical examinations and vaccinations. Because airline flights can only carry a limited number of dogs a day, it will take a couple of weeks for HSI to rescue all 200 of the dogs at the farm. Hygiene there is “non-existent”, Plumbly said, with waste collecting beneath cages where dogs are exposed to extremes of weather and fed once a day, according to HSI. The owner of the farm, who has been in the business for 30 years and declined to be identified, cited poor health as a reason for getting out of the business. Consumption of dog meat is on the decline in South Korea, where it is mainly eaten by older people and dogs are increasingly popular as pets. Still, HSI estimates there are 17,000 dog-meat farms in the country. Humane Society International hopes the government will ban the breeding of dogs for meat ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics to be held in South Korea.

75,2633,France's 20th century radium craze still haunts Paris.,"July 19, 2012","The Belle Epoque, France’s golden era at the turn of the last century, bequeathed Paris elegant landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, but also a more sinister legacy of radioactive floors and backyards which the capital is only now addressing.","Michel Rose, Marion Douet","When the Franco-Polish Nobel Prize winner Marie Curie discovered the radioactive element radium in 1898, she set off a craze for the luminescent metal among Parisians, who started using it for everything from alarm clock dials to lipsticks and even water fountains. The companies that manufactured these slightly radioactive objects have long gone out of business, but they left small doses of radium between the cracks of some Parisian parquet floors. These doses, after prolonged exposure, could prove toxic though, officials say, they do not pose serious health risks. “The history of radium started in Paris,” said Eric Lanes, head of radioactive decontamination at France’s national agency for radioactive waste, ANDRA. “Marie Curie never patented her discoveries so a lot of people rode the radium wave.”   After Curie showed that radium could be used to destroy cancerous cells, people assumed that the new element had miraculous healing properties and started putting it in everything from body lotions to cough syrups. “Cancerous cells are more sensitive to radiation than healthy ones. Curie understood that,” said Lanes. “But some people embarked on businesses more akin to charlatans’ tricks.”   Curie herself died at 66 from her prolonged, unprotected exposure to radium. ANDRA - in some case using addresses that were written on vintage advertising posters - has identified some 130 sites in France suspected of being at risk. Some 40 of them are set for decontamination, half of those in the Paris area. Lanes said the clean-up was being undertaken as a precautionary measure under a recent French law requiring that preventative steps be taken in a case of a suspected health risk even in the absence of conclusive scientific evidence. “We have never found any worrying situations,” Lanes said. “We’re talking about levels that are too small to create a health impact.”   In a two-storey detached house in the leafy suburb of Chaville, 12 km (7 miles) southwest of central Paris, masked men in white hazmat suits drilled holes in the wooden floors of what used to be an aircraft altimeter factory before World War Two. The factory workers used to color the dials with glow-in-the-dark paint made from radium powder and zinc sulphide. Their plight was reminiscent of the so-called Radium Girls in the United States who contracted radiation poisoning around 1917 from licking their paint-brushes to sharpen them. In Chaville, traces of paint are still present in the wooden floor, the house’s garden and basement. Though too small to present a risk, they still have to be collected in drums through air-locks and sent to ANDRA’s nuclear waste storage sites. The decontamination cost for a house like this is 260,000 euros ($318,200), Lanes said. The agency has a 4 million euro annual budget for decontamination on top of the government’s 12 million euro budget for its “radium plan”. The occupants, who declined to be interviewed because they feared the publicity could lower the property’s value, were temporarily rehoused at ANDRA’s expenses and will get the renovated house back after three months. Some sites deemed too contaminated to make a renovation cost-effective have been bought by ANDRA and razed. The Jersyk family’s former house in Gif-sur-Yvette, just south of Paris’ military airport of Villacoublay, is one of them. It was part of an estate built in the 1950s near a disused factory where radium needles for hospitals had been manufactured. “When the factory shut, the land was sold, the ground leveled, and they built houses on it, it was as simple as that. It’s monstrous,” said Eglet Jersyk, an 81-year-old pensioner. After spotting a news item in the local newspaper about the former factory’s radioactive legacy, she and her husband Christian joined a local group to demand government action. “No one told us anything when we bought it in 1966 but a lot of mystery surrounded that house. We were only told: ‘You shouldn’t grow vegetables in the garden’,” she said. Experts from France’s CEA atomic research agency came to visit the house in 1974 and found abnormal levels of radium and radon gas, she said, but it took some 30 years before the family could relocate to a nearby town. In the meantime, her husband, a do-it-yourself enthusiast who often worked in his basement, suffered from cough and heart problems which she said a doctor linked to radioactive fumes. Her complaint was dismissed by a court in the early 2000s, she said, and shortly after ANDRA offered to buy the house at market prices. ($1 = 0.8170 euros)",true,Environment

The congressman doesn’t read as much into the numbers as did Romney. But he flubbed the historical comparison pointed out by others, and experts say it’s a limited and potentially misleading comparison in any event.",Dave Umhoefer,"Near the end of an April 15, 2014 town hall meeting in his district, Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner listened to a constituent cite something on the Internet about the resignation of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. ""There’s no truth meter on the Internet,"" remarked Sensenbrenner, a Republican elected to Congress in southeastern Wisconsin since 1978. Respectfully, we beg to differ on that. A remark earlier in the town-hall session by Sensenbrenner about Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s plans to downsize the Army’s troop strength caught our attention. ""With respect to the president’s budget proposal, there the recommendation was that we have an Army of fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor,"" Sensenbrenner said when asked about survivor’s benefits. ""That’s ridiculous and outrageous."" Let’s put that one on our Truth-O-Meter. When we asked Sensenbrenner spokesman Ben Miller for backup on the historical comparison, he referred us to the U.S. Department of Defense’s budget request for fiscal year 2015. It quoted the Quadrennial Defense Review 2014. That five-year plan says the active Army will reduce its ""end strength"" to between 440,000 and 450,000 personnel. The current active-duty figure is about 520,000, Army spokesman Troy Rolan told us. Miller also pointed to stories in the New York Times, and a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that included Associated Press reporting on Hagel’s budget. The Times piece said that ""cuts proposed by the Obama administration would result in the smallest Army since just before the World War II buildup."" The AP report said the active-duty Army would shrink to the ""smallest number since 1940, when the nation was gearing up to enter World War II."" But Sensenbrenner didn’t say Hagel’s plan would result in the smallest Army since before the war buildup. He said it would be smaller than the pre-war troop complement. Before the U.S. buildup got cranked up, the Army had 188,000 troops in mid-1939 and 264,000 in mid-1940, official Army figures show. So Hagel’s plan for 440,000 active troops would still be larger than that, contrary to what Sensenbrenner said. Sensenbrenner’s phrasing looks better if you limit the comparison just to the 1941 period right before Pearl Harbor. But the troop numbers from 1941 include the U.S. buildup that began in 1940 in the wake of Germany’s 1939 invasion of Poland. By late August 1941, active-duty Army personnel totalled about 1.6 million. If Sensenbrenner was using 1.6 million as his comparison point, he couldn’t confine his outrage to the Obama/Hagel Army of 450,000, because every Army since 1952 has been smaller than 1.6 million. Troop levels ebb and flow, as you might expect, around major wars. After the World War II peak of 8.3 million, the Army’s numbers fell dramatically, then blipped up to 1.6 million during the Korean War. After another drop, the number ramped up to 1.475 million during the Vietnam War before levelling off at about 775,000 from the mid-1970s through the 1980s. The Army’s size fell significantly throughout the 1990s to 479,000 before slowly ticking up to 571,000 after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As America has drawn down troops in those nations, the Army’s strength has dropped to the current 520,000. So, with the proposed reduction, the Army would be just below where it was before the Sept. 11 attacks. Strained comparison There’s another angle to consider here: the difficulty in comparing a 1940 Army to today’s model. We asked military historian Lance Janda of Cameron University in Oklahoma to assess Sensenbrenner’s comments. Janda called the comments ""terribly misleading, implying as they do a sort of similarity between the technology, force structure, threat environment, and federal budget reality in 2014 and the one in 1940 that simply does not exist."" In terms of weapons systems, communications capabilities, speed of deployment, radius of action, and overall destructive potential, Janda said, the U.S. is light years beyond where it was prior to World War II. ""In 1940 our Army and army Air Corps were relatively small and our Navy was one among several powerful navies around the world,"" Janda said. ""Today, the United States Navy and Air Force have no peers."" Travis Sharp, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a nonprofit think tank, wrote that size of the force often does matter, but ""since the 2014 Army is not going to fight in the 1940 strategic environment, comparing them does not help us decide what to do today."" ""While interesting,"" Sharp wrote, ""the comparison to 1940 is not particularly useful."" ""Today's Army is vastly more capable, even at a fraction of the headcount,"" John Pike, director of Globalsecurity.org, told us. Hagel, in announcing the budget reductions in February 2014, called them difficult and not without added risk. Hagel said the cuts assume the United States no longer becomes involved in large, prolonged stability operations overseas on the scale of Iraq and Afghanistan, the Defense Department reported. But he said the smaller force still would be capable of decisively defeating aggression in one major war ""while also defending the homeland and supporting air and naval forces engaged in another theater against an adversary."" Still, some analysts, including Sharp, have expressed concerns about repercussions on the battlefield and beyond if the active-duty complement falls to 440,000 without appropriate contingency planning. ""Prioritizing technology over size has a strategic logic and conforms with historical practice,"" wrote Sharp. ""Despite this logic, focusing on high-tech modernization without simultaneously implementing policies to regenerate ground forces quickly should a crisis erupt constitutes strategic negligence of the highest order."" PolitiFact National checked a statement similar to Sensenbrenner’s in January 2012. The speaker was Mitt Romney. The Republican presidential candidate said that the U.S. military is at risk of losing its ""military superiority"" because ""our Navy is smaller than it’s been since 1917. Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947."" The claim earned a  rating. The numbers were close to accurate, but experts said it was wrong to assume a decline in the number of ships or aircraft automatically means a weaker military. And the comparison of today’s military to its predecessors in 1917 or 1947 was deemed ridiculous. Our rating Sensenbrenner said that President Obama’s budget proposed ""an Army of fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor."" The congressman doesn’t read as much into the numbers as did Romney.

79,2839,Increasing H7N9 bird flu toll demands constant vigilance.,"January 17, 2014",A wave of H7N9 bird flu cases and deaths in China since the start of 2014 shows emerging flu strains need constant surveillance if the world is not to be caught off guard by a deadly pandemic.,"Kate Kelland, Health, Science Correspondent","At least 24 H7N9 flu infections and three deaths have been confirmed in the past week by the World Health Organisation (WHO), a big increase on the two cases and one death reported for the four-month period of June to September. China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission said on Friday it had seen 28 confirmed human cases of H7N9 in five provinces across the country since the start of the year. “There’s now a clear second wave of this virus,” said Jake Dunning, a researcher at Imperial College London who has been monitoring the outbreak. While the winter flu season means an increase in infections is not unexpected, it raises the risk of the virus mutating and perhaps getting a chance to acquire genetic changes that may allow it to spread easily from one person to another. The H7N9 bird flu virus emerged in March last year and has so far infected at least 170 people in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, killing around 50 of them. Many, but not all, of those infected had contact with poultry or other birds, so for now this virus has apparently not adapted to easy human-to-human transmission - one of the main features keeping a pandemic emergency response on hold. China’s health commission said experts had concluded that H7N9 transmission “is still from poultry to humans”. Yet the strain does have some worrying features, including a limited capability to spread from one person to another. Several clusters of cases in people who had close contact with an infected person have been reported in China. An analysis of probable H7N9 transmission from person to person, published last August, gave the best proof yet that it can sporadically jump between people. A separate team of researchers in the United States said in December while it is not impossible that H7N9 could become easily transmissible from person to person, it would need to undergo multiple mutations. Another alarm was sounded last month when scientists said they had found that a mutation in the virus can render it resistant to a first-line treatment drug without limiting its ability to spread in mammals. WHO chief spokesman Gregory Hartl said the United Nations health agency had noted the rapid increase in infections in the past few weeks and was keeping a watchful eye. “So far we haven’t seen anything that causes us to change our risk assessment,” he said from WHO’s Geneva headquarters  The WHO’s stance, based on its December 20 assessment, is that five small family clusters have been reported but “evidence does not currently support sustained human-to-human transmission of this virus. The current likelihood of community-level spread ... is considered to be low.”  That was echoed by the Chinese health commission, which said: “Up to now, inspections have found no mutations of the virus that are of significance to public health”. Flu viruses, however, often put on their biggest show of strength in the northern hemisphere’s cold winter months of January and February. And with more of the virus circulating in wild birds, poultry and in the larger numbers of people infected, the new strain has more opportunity to adapt and mix with other strains that may give it pandemic potential. Peter Openshaw, director of the Centre for Respiratory Infection at Imperial College London, said the rising toll of infections and deaths is “a signal for concern” because “historically what has happened in major outbreaks is there are occasional, sporadic cases and then it starts to build”. “But whether it means that there is any change in the virus’ behavior is another important question. If it were changing the way it is behaving, that would be more alarming,” he said. Early gene analysis work on the emerging H7N9 virus in April last year found it had been circulating widely but went undetected and had acquired significant genetic diversity. Scientists warned then that its genetic diversity showed the H7N9 virus has an ability to mutate repeatedly and was likely to continue doing so. Hartl said: “Mutations happen all the time. While yes, the more virus there is, the more mutations could happen, it is also true that almost all of these mutations are benign.”",true,Health News

A similar hoax has been passed around in Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Egypt, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates. On March 22, President Donald Trump said during a press briefing that the federal government is deploying additional National Guard assistance to New York, California and Washington to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. During the same briefing, Vice President Mike Pence said the government is also working with the military to charter flights for Americans abroad. Meanwhile, Navy ships have been sent to New York and California to provide additional health care support. The Army Corps of Engineers is building more medical facilities. And, according to the Military Times, more than 8,000 National Guard troops have been mobilized in all 50 states. That’s a significant activation of the military within U.S. borders, but it’s a far cry from using helicopters to spray pesticides on cities across the country. In September, Rhode Island officials approved aerial spraying to kill mosquitoes, which had caused an outbreak of the eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus. Other states have taken similar actions, and the U.S. Air Force Reserve has an aerial spray program. But those efforts are aimed at limiting the populations of insects that carry diseases, not the diseases themselves. And while Chinese officials have used drones to disinfect surfaces potentially tainted by the coronavirus, experts told us there is no evidence that spraying pesticide from a helicopter would kill the virus on the ground in the U.S. ""That idea is pretty far-fetched,"" said Murray Isman, dean emeritus of the Faculty of Land and Food Systems at the University of British Columbia, in an email. ""There are no pesticides that specifically target viruses, and general antimicrobials that might have any effect (bleach, alcohol) would have to be applied in ridiculously high volumes."" According to the Environmental Protection Agency, disinfectants qualify as ""antimicrobial pesticides"" since they are used to kill bacteria and viruses. The agency has listed dozens of products on its website that meet the criteria for use against the coronavirus. The chain message is inaccurate. We rate it .

83,35554,Legionnaires' disease can be contracted from a face mask used repeatedly.,"August 6, 2020","In May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidance for reopening buildings after widespread and abrupt COVID-19 shutdowns of businesses, schools, and other facilities. Those closures resulted in decreased water usage, which could contribute to pooling in water systems that are prime locations for the growth of Legionella bacterium. Combined with shutdown-related declines in water chlorination and regular cleaning, the agency noted that the bacteria may accumulate in standing water over the course of weeks or months before being aerosolized through devices like showers, hot tubs, fountains, and air conditioning cooling towers used once localities reopen.",Madison Dapcevich,"A series of social media posts widely circulated in August 2020 claimed that Legionnaires’ disease, a respiratory infection that can cause a rare and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia, could be contracted from reused face masks worn to protect against COVID-19. Snopes readers asked us to verify this rumor that essentially argues respiratory droplets containing Legionella pneumophila, the pathogen that causes Legionnaires’ disease, may persist in those contaminated respiratory droplets held within a used mask. Specifically, the social media posts stated that the “moisture and bacteria” found in an anonymous woman’s mask, which she wore daily, resulted in a misdiagnosis of COVID-19. Mask wearers beware … A caller to a radio talk show recently shared that his wife was hospitalized and told she had COVID and only a couple of days left to live. A doctor friend suggested she be tested for legionnaires disease because she wore the same mask every day all day long. Turns out it WAS legionnaires disease from the moisture and bacteria in her mask. She was given antibiotics and within two days was better. WHAT IF these “spikes” in COVID are really something else due to improper mask wearing?? Copied and pasted The claim in the social media post is false. According to Legionella, a nonprofit organization that shares educational material and scientific research about the disease, Legionnaires’ is not contagious and cannot be transmitted by infected persons or their masks. “You cannot contract Legionnaires’ disease from wearing face masks. Legionella bacterium is transmitted by aspirating drinking water or breathing in water droplets. Legionella is not spread from person-to-person in respiratory droplets nor does the bacteria survive on dry surfaces. Your mask would not be a source of transmission for the Legionella bacteria,” wrote the organization on its website. Legionnaires’ disease is a severe form of lung infection caused by breathing in mist or water that is contaminated with the bacterium. The condition is characterized by a cough, fever, headache, and shortness of breath — all symptoms that are also associated with COVID-19 and could potentially result in the misdiagnosis. Though Legionnaires’ is treatable with antibiotics, about 1-in-10 infected people will die. However, as noted by Legionella, if a person were diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease, it would not be a consequence of wearing a mask. Water contaminated with the bacteria must be directly inhaled or drank by an individual in order to become infected. As such, a mask would theoretically need to come into direct contact with contaminated water in order for it to be inhaled. Even so, Legionella only grows in standing water under warm temperatures and cannot survive on dry surfaces.",false,"Medical, COVID-19"
84,31114,Justin Bieber and Katy Perry made public statements warning that the music industry is run by pedophiles.,"August 7, 2017","We reached out to representatives of Justin Bieber and Kate Perry for comment, but did not hear back before publication time.",David Emery,"In early August 2017, articles appeared on unreliable web sites reporting that two of the most popular entertainers in pop music, Justin Bieber and Katy Perry, had made public statements asserting that the music industry is run by pedophiles. (Note: We recognize that pedophilia, which is defined as a sexual attraction to children, is not the same as child sexual abuse, although the web sites under discussion do not observe that distinction.) A YourNewsWire story written by Dmitry Baxter (one of the promulgators of the thoroughly discredited “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory claiming in 2016 that Hillary Clinton and other “Washington elites” ran a pedophile ring out of a pizza restaurant in the nation’s capitol) intimated that the reason Bieber canceled the last leg of his 2017 world tour in July was his realization that pedophilia is rampant in the entertainment business:  Justin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that he has “woken up” to the “evils of the music industry” and he needs to take a break from the industry because it is “controlled by the absolute worst kind of people — pedophiles.” Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Saturday 22nd July he shared what he described as a “horrific story” with the congregation and explained why he felt he had to quit his world tour. Describing a party on tour — attended by the upper echelon of the music business, including executive VPs of development, producers, power agents and international financiers — Bieber said he was encouraged to sexually abuse a young child who had been bought to the party for the sexual gratification of the industry elite. One day later, a similar article about Katy Perry was posted on the web site Neon Nettle (another hardcore purveyor of “Pizzagate” rumors, not to mention articles falsely attributing statements about show business pedophilia to actor Brad Pitt and implying connections between the deaths of alt-rockers Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington and music industry child abusers): In a shocking exposé from one of the biggest pop stars in the world, Katy Perry has dealt a devastating blow to the entertainment world elite by revealing that the entire industry is “controlled” by “sick pedophiles”. The “I Kissed a Girl” singer had left many concerned about her mental state following a series of public breakdowns earlier this year. She made headlines when she disclosed her suicidal tendencies and exhibited signs of a split personality disorder, saying “I don’t want to be Katy Perry anymore”. The article goes on to paint a picture virtually identical to that in the YourNewsWire article of industry pedophiles making up an “exclusive club”:  Clearly troubled by the details, she told a group of close friends: “I can’t live this life any longer. They’re all pedophiles. What they do to these children is sick.” She continues to elaborate, visibly traumatized by the things she’s witnessed: “And they’re every where you go. It’s like they’re not even trying to hide it. They flaunt it like it’s a badge of honor” “The producers, the executives, the big names… They’re all in on it” “It’s like an exclusive club that you can only join if you do these evil things to innocent children… And it’s not just dirty old men, it’s all of them. Even the women.” “They say to me, ‘Katy, you need to take the next step in your career’, but there’s no way I would do those things to kids.” Despite the fact that both stories include elements of truth to shore up their credibility — Justin Bieber did cancel part of his 2017 tour, for example, and Katy Perry did say in a live-streamed therapy session that she doesn’t want to be “Katy Perry” anymore (i.e., in the sense of having to live up to fans’ expectations) — in neither case are the statements attributed to them about pedophilia sufficiently sourced or corroborated to earn readers’ credence. No such statements by Bieber and Perry have been quoted (or even mentioned) by any mainstream news outlets. On the contrary, these statements are lurid fabrications designed either to garner social media likes and shares (and advertising dollars), or spread disinformation intended to harm the reputations of so-called “Hollywood elites” (a favorite political target of both YourNewsWire and Neon Nettle), or both. Unfortunately, by disseminating these false stories, the web sites dilute and lend confusion to the impact of actual claims of industry pedophilia made by the likes of former child actors Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood, who have separately gone on record saying the extent to which the sexual abuse of minors occurs in Hollywood is underreported. Worse, child abuse is one of those emotion-laden topics that can lead to violence, so there’s no room for false reporting. One would hope that lessons were learned from the Pizzagate debacle, which resulted in a credulous fake news reader firing an AR-15 rifle inside Washington DC’s Comet Ping Pong, a family restaurant; the shooter said he expected to rescue “child sex slaves” from a pedophile ring that does not exist, which was purportedly run out of the restaurant’s basement, which also does not exist.",false,"Entertainment, conspiracy theories, fake news, justin bieber"

This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State,” Trump wrote on May 20, 2020. “I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!”The allegation was quickly refuted by Michigan secretary of state Jocelyn Benson.“We sent applications, not ballots,” she replied. “Just like my GOP colleagues in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia.”Hi! 👋🏼 I also have a name, it’s Jocelyn Benson. And we sent applications, not ballots. Just like my GOP colleagues in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia. https://t.co/kBsu4nHvOy— Jocelyn Benson (@JocelynBenson) May 20, 2020Not only was Trump lying about Benson’s office sending “absentee ballots,” in reality the “7.7 million people” he referenced represents the total number of registered voters in the state. As the Detroit Free Press reported, receiving an application for an absentee ballot does not automatically mean one will be issued; the application would still need to be filled out and returned to the recipient’s local clerk’s office either physically or via regular or e-mail. If the recipient’s signature on the application matches the one in their existing voter records, they are then issued a ballot.According to Benson, the move to expand opportunities for casting an absentee ballot followed an uptick in voter turnout via mail on May 5 2020, when fifty local elections were held throughout the state amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed 4,915 residents since March 2020.“By mailing applications we have ensured that no Michigander has to choose between their health and their right to vote,” Benson said. She also correctly stated that Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska, and West Virginia — all states with Republicans holding her position — sent absentee ballot request forms available to their respective electorates.Trump’s threat to “hold up funding” against the state is his latest swipe at Democratic officials in Michigan, such as Benson and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Earlier in the month the president used his Twitter account to support armed far-right demonstrators demanding that Whitmer ease stay-at-home health measures to limit the spread of the disease. In reality, a much greater majority of Americans has consistently expressed concern that “reopening businesses” would only cause an increase in COVID-19 infections.The Twitter smear was also another instance of Trump attempting to push the completely false claim of “voter fraud.”Comments",false,"Disinformation, Fact Checks"
90,2493,Bike sharing offers big fitness benefits for the little commute.,"June 24, 2013","With bike sharing plans rolling on asphalt from New York City to Budapest, experts say city streets are becoming as fitness-friendly as country trails.",Dorene Internicola,"Even short cycling jaunts can make a difference in the health of city dwellers. “If you were driving a car and switched to biking, that 10 minutes going and coming a day would be a big deal,” said Dr. Robert Oppliger, an exercise physiologist with the American College of Sports Medicine. Oppliger, an avid cyclist, said even a two-to-three-mile (3.2-to-4.8-km) spin can yield significant health benefits. “There’s a lot of information coming out on something called active transport that compares traveling by bike or public transit to traveling by car,” he said. “The benefits are significant the more mobile you are.”  Government guidelines recommend adults accumulate 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activity per week. Cycling, he said, can be part of that. “Bicycling has positive effects on weight and cardio- vascular health,” he said. “Even a couple of times a week is beneficial in terms of all the problems with obesity.”  Last week the American Medical Association designated obesity, which affects one third of U.S. adults, a disease. Not all cities can accommodate bike share programs, which are not designed for avid cyclists, said Oppliger. He said his hometown of Iowa City, a relatively small community with short commuting distances, is unsuited for such a program. In New York City, which kicked off a massive bike sharing program this spring, 56 percent of auto trips are under three miles, according to the New York City Department of Transportation website. “For two to three miles it’s a pretty good way to get around,” said Oppliger, who also praised the city for adding 200 bike lane miles in the past three years alone. “New York City has done a pretty good job of preparing the area and now it’s starting to pay off,” he added. Bicycling magazine’s Editor-in-Chief Peter Flax predicts that 10 years from now the decision to introduce bike sharing to New York City will have seemed obvious. “Maybe more than any other American city, New York is perfectly suited to bike share,” said Flax. “It’s relatively flat and efficient to get around.”  Flax has sampled similar programs in Washington, D.C., Paris and Barcelona. He readily admits, after watching a parade of New York’s big blue bikes riding against the traffic on a one-way street, that the biggest, most ambitious bike share program in North America is in for a period of adjustment. “We’re 25 to 30 years behind Europe,” he said. “Our cycling community needs to embrace the rules of the road.”  He foresees attitudes changing as the bikes blend into street life. “In five years it won’t be a problem,” he predicts. “Taxi drivers are already changing their behavior. The last thing they want is to have an accident with someone on a city bike.”  Dani Simons of NYC Bike Share, which controls day-to-day operations, said the goal was simply to make it easier for New Yorkers to get around their city. So far more 44,780 people have signed up for annual membership in the New York program, which is similar in concept to bike shares in Paris, London and Boston, the website Citibikenyc.com. “We are really, really pleased,” said Simons, adding email requests are flooding in from New Yorkers who live in parts of the city not served by the program. New York-based fitness expert Liz Neporent, author of “Fitness for Dummies,” applauds the program. “The bikes are getting used a lot. I’m all for anything that gets people moving,” she said, adding that cycling gets hearts and lungs into shape and exercises muscles without stressing the joints. “Every little bit adds up,” she said. “Riding a bike beats grabbing a cab or sitting your butt down in the subway.”",true,Health News
91,2661,"Pop culture, wealthy Chinese spur medical tourism in Asia.","October 4, 2011",It is one of Asia’s fastest growing industries and shows no signs of losing steam even as the global economy wobbles.,Jeremy Laurence,"A plastic surgeon (L) speaks to his patient who travelled from Australia to Seoul to get liposuction at the BK DongYang Plastic Surgery Clinic in Seoul October 4, 2011. REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won Traveling abroad for medical treatment is now a multi-billion dollar business. From a nip-and-tuck to a heart bypass, hospitals from India to Singapore and South Korea treat more than 1 million foreign patients a year — lured by cut-price surgery, no waiting lists, cutting-edge technology, and highly trained doctors. Industry experts predict medical tourism in Asia will grow at a rate of 15 to 20 percent a year, mainly due to the emergence of nouveaux riches in the region. “Asian medical tourism ... seems to be increasing as affluence and mobility increase in Asia,” said David Vequist, head of the Center for Medical Tourism Research at the University of the Incarnate Word in Texas. “Consumer choice is a powerful force now in healthcare and is impacted by aging and increasingly heavier, sicker, and more needy populations in Asia.”   Medscape News web site has forecast medical tourism in Asia could generate $4.4 billion by 2012. The United States provides the most patients, as Americans travel abroad to avert the astronomical costs of having private treatment at home. Typically, Americans can save 40-50 percent. But there is a new patient on the operating table, and he or she is Chinese. Many of these patients are willing to spend what it takes to fix their problem. “No matter how expensive it is, I will go for it,” says Liu Xiao-yang, 34, of Shanghai, after having double-eyelid surgery, a facelift and corrective jaw surgery in Seoul. The rise of an affluent class in China, and an infatuation with so-called Hallyu, or Korean Wave, culture from pop music to drama have spurred a sharp growth in South Korean medical tourism, mainly in the field of cosmetic surgery. “Every time I watch South Korean drama and TV shows, I feel that they are pretty and I want to look like them,” says Liu. Kim Byung-gun, a plastic surgeon at the BK DongYang Plastic Surgery Clinic in Seoul, says his patients have ranged in age from 6, for double-eyelid procedure, to a 70-year-old seeking a skin lift. On average, they spend $5,000-$10,000 per procedure. “Medical tourism is going to be one of the growth engines of the South Korean economy,” Kim says, identifying the Korean Wave as a key contributor to the rapid growth of the sector in Asia’s fourth largest economy. South Korean authorities have every reason to be optimistic about the growth of the industry, particularly in the field of elective cosmetic surgery. CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets in a study released last month estimated that China would account for 60 percent of the rise in high net-worth individuals’ wealth in Asia over the next five years. Chinese patients arrive in South Korea with photographs of Korean celebrities they want to look like, says Lee Soo-jung of the Lamar Plastic Surgery Clinic in Seoul. Han Dong-woo of the Korea Health Industry Development Institute says the number of tourists coming to South Korea ballooned last year to nearly 82,000, generating about $700 million in revenues. Three years earlier, fewer than 8,000 medical tourists travelled to South Korea. Han projects some 200,000 will come next year. By 2020, the South Korean government envisages a million medical tourists a year. “I see an infinite growth potential in the plastic surgery market for foreigners,” says Han, who estimates operation costs in South Korea are about half that of the United States. South Korea may be one of the fastest growing medical tourism destinations, but for now it lags far behind trailblazers Thailand, Singapore, India, Malaysia and even the Philippines. They all have their own distinctive marketing strategies in an attempt to woo clients, as well as areas of specialization. Thailand and India, Asia’s leading destinations, specialize in orthopedic and cardiac surgery. India’s government says its medical services are cheaper than those in southeast Asia, and identifies its English-speaking doctors as providing a “major comfort factor.”   It has even introduced a special visa category to cater for the growing number of medical tourists. Thailand sells itself as dual purpose destination where medical treatment can be combined with a cheap recuperative holiday. Bangkok was this year identified by TripIndex as the best value global city for U.S. travelers. The Singapore healthcare industry positions itself as a “premium” center. Among its patrons have been many of Malaysia’s sultans, as well as other high profile political figures and celebrities from Asia and the Middle East. By next year, Singapore aims to treat a million foreign patients a year, generating about $3 billion for the economy, the Singapore Straits Times has reported. Its area of expertise includes cancer treatments, cardiology and other specialized care. Like South Korea, it sees China, as well as India, as being the catalysts for growth,   Neighboring Malaysia, attracted nearly 400,000 medical tourists last year, and aims to increase that number to 1.9 million by 2020, mainly by way of undercutting Singapore. A health official said costs in Malaysia are 30 percent cheaper than the city-state to the south. The Philippines also sees itself as a cut-price destination, and is projecting the number of medical tourists to hit one million by 2015, generating at least $1 billion in revenue. It targets patients from the United States, Canada, Taiwan and Japan. “We can compete with the rest of Asia because we have an edge in providing high quality medical and dental services but at a much lower cost,” said Marie Recarro, an official at the Department of Tourism in Manila. Some experts, however, lament the rise of the medical tourism industry, saying it exacerbates a brain drain of talent from the state to the private system, from rural to urban areas. A paper published in the International Journal for Equity in Health last year said specialists were being swayed by the higher wages and better technology of the private sector. If the industry achieved even a fraction of its projected growth “this could ultimately lead to locals being priced out of their own health care system, as demand from foreign patients can drive up the costs of providing care for everyone,” it said. Experts cite other concerns such as medical errors, lax follow-up care, and insurance, regulatory and ethical issues. The World Health Organization said in a report late last year that rapid development of medical tourism had presented “considerable implications for public health.”   It said that with the influx of foreign patients, the demand for and price of healthcare might rise. “In addition, an increasing number of health services might cater for the needs of foreign patients and neglect local needs,” it said.",true,Health News

The numbers don’t add up. The two broader disability categories that include back pain (""diseases of the musculoskeletal system"") and anxiety disorders (""mental disorders - other"") don’t even equal close to 50 percent, let alone those two ailments by themselves. Paul’s quip might make for a good soundbite, but it’s not rooted in reality.",Steve Contorno,"Turning 40? Sen. Rand Paul says you can look forward to back pain in your near future, and maybe some anxiety. But don’t try to turn your ailments into a government check. At a breakfast event Wednesday, Jan. 14 in New Hampshire, the Kentucky Republican and potential presidential candidate spoke out against a public safety net that catches too many people who don’t need help. ""The thing is, all of these programs, there’s always somebody who’s deserving. (But) everybody in this room knows somebody who is gaming the system,"" Paul said. The proof? Look no further than the diagnoses landing people on disability, he added. ""Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts. Join the club,"" he said to laughter. ""Who doesn’t get up a little anxious for work every day and their back hurts? Everybody over 40 has a little back pain."" Paul may be having a little fun about the aches and pains of growing older, but his comment raises serious questions about a program relied on by millions of people. Is the majority of the disability population suffering from back pain and anxiety? We decided to check the numbers. Identifying the problem The Social Security Administration has provided benefits to people with disabilities since President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation in 1956. The program is intended to provide cash assistance to people who are disabled for a year or longer and cannot work or can only work menial jobs for little pay (about $1,000 a month). The number of individuals receiving disability has been on an upward trajectory for decades. In 1970, there were less than 2 million beneficiaries; now, the program has surpassed 10 million, far outpacing U.S. population growth. Nearly two-thirds of people on disability are 50 or older. The large growth in the program has sparked claims of waste, fraud and abuse. And indeed, several reports from the Government Accountability Office have found problems with the program, as Paul’s office pointed out. After an audit of disability insurance in 2013, the Government Accountability Office estimated that  in fiscal year 2011, the Social Security Administration made $1.29 billion in potential cash benefit overpayments to about 36,000 individuals who were working and making more than $1,100 a month (the limit to receive disability benefits). The 36,000 people receiving improper payments, while a lot on paper, represent about 0.4 percent of all beneficiaries, the report said. There are other ways Social Security gives out benefits to those not deserving, but paying people already working is about 72 percent of the problem, according to the Social Security Administration. Factoring that in, the GAO estimates overpayments equaled $1.62 billion, or 1.27 percent of all disability benefits, in 2011. It’s a lot of money, but the disability program is a $128 billion program. The Government Accountability Office goes on to say the exact number of improper payments is unknown. It could be higher. Additionally, another GAO report warned the Social Security Administration’s efforts to thwart potential physician-assisted fraud are ""hampered by a lack of planning, data, and coordination."" Back and anxiety Let’s narrow in on Paul’s specific claim: ""Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts."" This is not rooted in the official numbers. Social Security does not group people by back pain or anxiety in any of their published reports. Instead, they track a much broader list of physical and mental ailments. What would back pain or anxiety fall under? Most back problems would fall under the category ""diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,"" the most common ailment. In 2013, 27.7 percent of all people received benefits for these types of ailments. If you look at just workers, it was 30.5 percent. There's also another category, ""injuries,"" that might include some back problems. Those affect another 4 percent of workers. But not all musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases are back problems. Far from it. They include ailments ranging from a broken bone and bad burns to amputated limbs and deformities. Anxiety would be included in ""mental disorders."" That category is broken down further as follows: As you can see, it's a pretty confusing list, and it's not immediately clear which category certain mental ailments would fall into. If by ""anxious,"" Paul meant a catchall term for all mental disorders, then, sure, about one-third of all disabled workers have some sort of mental issue. Paul's spokesman singled out the subcategory ""mood disorders"" when explaining how Paul reached his conclusion. Other media outlets have similarly placed anxiety under this heading. However, the Social Security Administration told us that category typically includes affective disorders like depression, not anxiety disorders. Instead, people suffering from ""anxiety disorders"" -- which include things like post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder -- are included in the ""other"" category. That category also includes diseases like Tourette syndrome and affects far fewer people than mood disorders, about 3.9 percent. For the sake of argument, let's follow Paul's faulty logic. Even assuming generously that every single person with a musculoskeletal system problem came in with ""back pain,"" and every person with a ""mood disorder"" had anxiety, it still only equals 45.4 percent, less than half. Throw in ""other"" mental disorders, you're still just below 50 percent. If you categorize anxiety correctly as ""other"" and add it to all musculoskeletal system problems, you would end up far lower, at 34 percent. And again, not every person with a musculoskeletal problem has a back problem, and not every person with a mental disorder has anxiety. For Paul to imply as much is either stretching reality or downplaying serious ailments. There has been an increase in the number of people receiving disability for musculoskeletal system and mental problems. In 1961, the most common ailment for new beneficiaries was heart disease or stroke. Meanwhile, 8 percent of those going on disability received assistance for musculoskeletal system issues. That’s an interesting and notable statistic, and one worth exploring. NPR published a very extensive report suggesting some older, unskilled workers are going on disability (many with back issues) because the only jobs available to them are physically strenuous. But that doesn’t wash away Paul’s mischaracterization of the ailments nor his inflation of the numbers. Our ruling Paul said, ""Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts."" The numbers don’t add up. The two broader disability categories that include back pain (""diseases of the musculoskeletal system"") and anxiety disorders (""mental disorders - other"") don’t even equal close to 50 percent, let alone those two ailments by themselves.

He described it as “scary.”“I was scared to death,” Tres Biggs said. “I’m a country kid — I had to strip down, get hosed and put a jumpsuit on.”Bail was $500. He said they had “maybe $50 to $100” at the time.In rural Coffeyville, Kansas, where the poverty rate is twice the national average, attorneys like Michael Hassenplug have built successful law practices representing medical providers to collect debt owed by their neighbors … That law was put in place at Hassenplug’s own recommendation to the local judge. The attorney uses that law by asking the court to direct people with unpaid medical bills to appear in court every three months and state they are too poor to pay in what is called a “debtors exam.”If two hearings are missed, the judge issues an arrest warrant for contempt of court. Bail is set at $500.Hassenplug said he gets “paid on what’s collected.” If the bail money is applied to the judgment, then he gets a portion of that, he said.Biggs was jailed after missing an appearance related to unpaid medical debt, thanks to a law put into place on the recommendation of attorney Michael Hassenplug. Hassenplug told CBS he is compensated in part through bail money collected in the course of hearings like the one Biggs reportedly missed.In the comments on Facebook, some users argued that the reported imprisonment was not directly due to medical debt, but for missed hearings:The headline is super mis-leading. NO ONE is going to jail for not paying their debt, medical or otherwise. They are going to jail when the Court enters an Order requiring them to show up in court and they don’t show up, in contempt of court.Biggs was originally the subject of a far larger, far more detailed investigation by ProPublica published in October 2019.

ProPublica reported that of the missed hearings, some “fell on days when [Biggs’ son] Lane had [leukemia] treatment, at a hospital in Tulsa, an hour south,” and that Biggs’ wife Heather refused to postpone their child’s cancer care:[A] warrant, [Biggs] learned at the jailhouse, was for failure to appear in court for an unpaid hospital bill. Coffeyville Regional Medical Center had sued him in 2006 for $2,146, after one of Heather’s emergency visits; neither of his jobs offered health insurance. In the shuffle of 70-hour workweeks and Lane’s chemotherapy, he had missed two consecutive court dates. He was fingerprinted, photographed, made to strip and told to brace himself for a tub of delousing liquid. His bail was set at $500 cash; he had about $50 to his name.His friend bailed him out the next morning, but at the bond hearing, the judge granted the $500, minus court fees, to the hospital. Biggs compensated his friend with a motorboat that a client had given him in exchange for a hunting dog. But it wasn’t long before the family received a new summons. In 2009, a radiologist represented by Hassenplug sued them for $380.The article included some background and ongoing information about the Biggs’ entire medical and financial picture, and that after his imprisonment, “Biggs was still on the hook for the bill that had landed him in jail; bail had covered only part of it, and the rest was growing with 12% annual interest.” Further, the hospital had garnished Biggs’ wages, and the radiologist had garnished his bank account, seizing contributions that his family had raised for Lane’s cancer treatment:By 2012, the Biggs family had accrued more than $70,000 in medical debt, which it owed to Coffeyville Regional Medical Center and other hospitals, pediatricians and neurologists. Some forgave it; others set up lenient payment plans. Coffeyville’s was the only hospital that sued. The doctors who took them to court were represented by Hassenplug.ProPublica’s fourth paragraph began with an introduction to the presiding judge — a man without any legal background:Judge David Casement entered the courtroom, a black robe swaying over his cowboy boots and silversmithed belt buckle. He is a cattle rancher who was appointed a magistrate judge, though he’d never taken a course in law. Judges don’t need a law degree in Kansas, or many other states, to preside over cases like these.In 2017, The Atlantic reported that Kansas was one of a handful of states where judges like Casement “don’t need a law degree” in order to put defendants behind bars:Montana and seven other states — Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New York, Texas, South Carolina, and Wyoming — allow non-lawyer judges to hand down jail sentences for misdemeanors without the right to a new trial before a lawyer-judge. Some states, like Montana, only allow the practice in rural or sparsely populated counties, while others allow it statewide.The situation may have been acceptable in the 19th century, when lawyers and law schools were scarce, critics say. But in the modern era, they say it raises serious questions about due process and the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. “What’s the point of having a legally-trained lawyer if the judge can’t understand what they’re saying?” said Stuart Banner, a University of California Los Angeles law professor.Biggs was not the only medical debt sufferer featured in ProPublica’s story. In one excerpt, Hassenplug faced off against a young survivor of a suicide attempt, whose income of disability checks was exempt from the reach of the court and its orders:SEATED AT THE FRONT of the courtroom, Hassenplug zipped open his leather binder and uncapped his fountain pen. He is stout, with a pinkish nose and a helmet of salt and pepper hair. His opening case this Tuesday involved 28-year-old Kenneth Maggard, who owed more than $2,000, including interest and court fees, for a 40-mile ambulance ride [in 2018]. Maggard had downed most of a bottle of Purple Power Industrial Strength Cleaner, along with some 3M Super Duty Rubbing Compound, “to end it all.” His sister had called 911.Maggard took his seat. He had cropped red hair, pouchy cheeks and mud-caked sneakers. “The welfare patients are the most demanding, difficult patients on God’s earth,” Hassenplug told me, with Maggard listening, before launching into his interrogation: Are you working? No. Are you on disability? He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and anxiety. Do you have a car? No. Anyone owe you money you can collect? I wish.They had been here before, and they both knew Maggard’s disability checks were protected from collections. Hassenplug set down his pen. “Between you and me,” he asked, “you’re never going to pay this bill, are you?”“No, never,” Maggard said. “If I had the money, I’d pay it.”Hassenplug replied, “Well, this will end when one of us dies.”Another man jailed in the course of the court’s operations had no means to travel to the rural courthouse:Derek Dustman, who is 36 and works odd jobs, had been driving a four-wheeler when he was hit by a car and rushed to the hospital. Though he was sued for not paying his $818 ambulance bill, he didn’t have a license to drive to the courthouse. This spring [in 2019], he spent two nights in jail. “I never in a million years thought that this would end with jail time,” he told me.Much of the reporting concerned confusing or conflicting information provided by parties involved — such as Casement and Hassenplug — about the legal authority of debt collectors to influence decisions such as the issuance of a bench warrant or the imprisonment of any individual for inability to appear before the court or pay a medical debt. In one excerpt about a woman named Christa Strickland and her attempts to pay a 2008 bill for $2,514 (which had risen to $5,736 thanks in part to court fees by October 2019), ProPublica requested clarification from Account Recovery Specialists Inc. (ARSI) and from a lawyer named Amber Brehm.Lizzie Presser, who reported on the issue for the ProPublica, explained Strickland’s frantic attempts to avoid a bench warrant after missing a hearing by one day:When I asked ARSI about how attorneys decide to request warrants, Joshua Shea, who is general counsel, told me that they don’t. The judge can choose to issue one if court orders are not followed, he said. But Casement said the opposite, telling me that he gave the choice to the attorneys. “I’m not ordering a bench warrant. My decision is to give them that option,” Casement told me. “Whether they exercise it is up to them, but they have my blessing if that’s what they want to do.”Shea sent me an eight-page email to make clear, in large part, that ARSI, as a collection agency, has no involvement in the courts, and that Brehm is a lawyer whom the agency contractually employs and who represents the hospital directly. Her email address, though, has an ARSI domain, and her resume lists her as ARSI’s director of legal. Brehm said that court hearings aren’t the only option for debtors, who can call her instead and answer questions under oath. Shea said nobody — not the hospital, ARSI, Brehm or the court — uses the threat of jail to “extract payment.”Strickland reached Brehm after several days, and the attorney agreed to a new hearing. On Aug. 13 [2019], when they met in court, Brehm sat at the front of the room.“We’re giving you a second chance on that citation; just to try to take care of this without there having to be any sort of bench warrant,” [Brehm] said. “I want to make sure that we’re all on the same page about the consequences of not coming into court when the order has been issued.”Strickland nodded.“Again, if you set a payment plan and keep it,” Brehm said, “we won’t have to worry about that.”Slate.com’s What’s Next podcast covered the ProPublica report in October 2019, following with a transcript of the segment on February 10 2020.Other news outlets followed up on the way Coffeyville handles of medical debt in February 2020, independently confirming the ProPublica investigation, which (as we mentioned) was originally published in late 2019. CBS News reported that while their cameras were not permitted, only one of 60 medical debtors present on the day they visited had a lawyer with them:CBS News went to court on debt collection day. They wouldn’t allow our cameras in, but we watched more than 60 people swear they didn’t have enough money to pay, and only one of them had an attorney representing them.In related fact checks, the question of whether medical debt was the cause of bankruptcies emerged as a point of dispute in the same way that commenters argued people were jailed not over debt, but over missed court appearances. Semantic objections of that description seemed to be the only counterargument involved, since both instances involved otherwise accurate and verified claims.In February 2020, CBS News rehashed the findings of a late 2019 ProPublica investigation into people in Kansas jailed over medical debt, largely thanks to an unusual rural court system that was influenced by debt collection firms and lawyers. That investigation and subsequent interviews with lawyers and debt collectors involved confirmed the accuracy of the report — that people in Kansas were indeed jailed due to unpaid medical debt. A presiding judge said that lawyers had broad discretion, and that at least one victim reported missing hearings because they were taking their child to receive cancer treatments. None of the parties involved disputed that people were jailed over medical debt in various independent investigations.",true,"Fact Checks, Viral Content"
97,11603,FDA approves Epclusa for treatment of chronic Hepatitis C virus infection,"July 6, 2016","This release announces the approval by the FDA of a new pill, Epclusa, for patients with chronic infections with Hepatitis C virus, also known as HCV. The tablet combines an existing drug, sofosbuvir, with a new drug, velpatasvir, and is the first single therapy for all six major forms of the virus. Patients can be infected with different forms and require different treatments. The release informs on the novelty, harms and benefits of the drug but doesn’t give reporters — or lay readers — much background on the clinical trials that led to the approval. An estimated 120 million people have HCV infections worldwide, with an upper estimate of 3.9 million in the US alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This new treatment — Epclusa — has an estimated cost of about $74,800 per 12-week necessary therapy length — or about $900 per pill. But without treatment, many HCV patients may require years of treatment and suffer damage to their livers that require transplants and could ultimately be more expensive. The economics of new drugs is a vital part of any story about the drugs. We wish this release had included some context on the cost issues surrounding HCV infection for both patients and the society at large. A blogger with Bloomberg News focused a post about the drug pricing which has been controversial due to the millions of patients affected.","Sally James,A'ndrea Elyse Messer, MS, PhD,Kathlyn Stone","The release does not discuss cost. The FDA evaluates drugs without consideration of cost, so it’s understandable that they wouldn’t comment on it — and that’s why we’re rating this Not Applicable. We look forward to the day when any news release about a new drug — even one from the FDA — includes some mention of cost in its message. After all, the value of a new drug is a function not just of how well it works, but its cost-effectiveness. The release includes results from Phase III clinical trials in about 1,600 patients showing a benefit. “Results demonstrated that 95–99 percent of patients who received Epclusa had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the patients’ infections had been cured.” The release also notes that after 12 weeks, 94 percent of patients with more advanced disease who received Epclusa in combination with ribavirin showed no virus in their blood. The release notes that the most common side effects of Epclusa are headache and fatigue. It also explains that Epclusa carries a warning that “serious slowing of the heart rate (symptomatic bradycardia) and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is used with sofosbuvir in combination with another HCV direct-acting antiviral.” The FDA also warns that certain drugs may reduce the amount of Epclusa in the blood which would reduce its effectiveness. The release does not use the important words “randomized controlled” that would signal to the reader about the quality of the evidence. The release also does not give us the precise size of cohorts, or even tell us where to get further details with a journal citation, URL or a link. The FDA also missed an opportunity to inform readers about limitations of these studies and gaps in our knowledge related to these medications. For example, these were short-term studies, and so we don’t yet know whether these patients will have fewer cases of liver cancer, liver failure, or need for liver transplants down the line. That’s an educated inference based on the drug’s ability to eradicate the virus — but not proven. There is no disease mongering. The release did not identify funding sources or state whether there were any conflicts of interest.This release describes the approval of a new drug by a regulatory agency, but we’d still like to know who sponsored the study that’s the basis for the approval. It’s not enough to state who manufactures and markets the drug. The release explains in some detail that different HCV patients may follow different drug regimens, depending on their particular strain of virus and other characteristics of their infection. A bit more explanation about how patients and providers may choose whether to use Epclusa or other alternatives and how they will compare would have been helpful. The release is announcing the approval of the drug which usually means it will be available in the near future. The release states that this is a wholly new combination drug that has not been available until this approval by the FDA. It also states that it is the first drug that works for all six strains of the virus. There was no unjustifiable language.",true,Government agency news release
98,22663,"Lorraine Fende Says that in Ohio ""right now, you could be 8½ months pregnant and have an abortion for no reason.","February 4, 2011",Rep. Lorraine Fende on point that abortion at 8 1/2 months is legal,Joe Guillen,"A new bill to ban late-term abortions is gaining traction in the Ohio House of Representatives, reinvigorating debate over the state’s abortion laws. If passed, the bill would ban abortions when a woman is at least 20 weeks pregnant and tests show the fetus can live outside the womb – a condition known as being viable. The proposed ban contains exceptions for certain medical situations, a legal requirement for late-term abortion bans at the state level. The proposed ban is one of three bills related to abortion the Republican majority in the House introduced this week. The set of abortion bills comes on the heels of similar legislation Democratic Rep. Lorraine Fende of Willowick introduced earlier this year. Fende’s bill aimed to ban abortions when a woman is at least 22 weeks pregnant with a viable fetus. Fende’s bill is likely going nowhere now that Republicans have trumped her proposal with one of their own. But a case she made for her bill – involving the availability of late-term abortions in Ohio – also is central to Republicans’ plan to ban late-term abortions. ""I had a conversation with someone quite some time ago that right now, you could be 8½ months’ pregnant and have an abortion for no reason,"" Fende told The Columbus Dispatch for a story published Jan. 17. Similarly, proponents of Republicans’ plan to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy decried the occurrence of abortions in Ohio up to the ninth month of pregnancy. While advocates and opponents of the proposed ban on late-term abortions prepare to debate this sensitive issue as it moves through the legislature, it is important to keep the facts straight. So we decided to check out Fende’s claim. Fende said she relied on statistics from the Ohio Department of Health. Doctors who perform an abortion in Ohio must submit to the department a Confidential Abortion Report, which does not include the woman’s name or other identifying information. According to the Ohio Department of Health, four abortions were performed in Ohio after 32 weeks (or eight months) of pregnancy in 2009, the most recent year in which statistics are available. Two abortions were performed when the mother was 32 weeks along; one abortion took place at 33 weeks; and one occurred at 35 weeks. Overall, 28,721 abortions were reported in Ohio in 2009. Of those, 613 involved pregnancies at least 20 weeks along and 116 of them were for women at least 24 weeks pregnant. The length of the pregnancy was unknown in 276 cases. The numbers confirm that at least one abortion occurred in Ohio when a mother was at least 8½ months’ pregnant. Fende said she was aware of this one abortion when she made her claim, and she said she did not know the reason behind it. Ohio law does not include an absolute ban on abortions when a woman is 8½, 8¾ or even 9 months’ pregnant. State lawmakers tried to pass a late-term abortion ban in 1995, but the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the ban was unconstitutional because medical exceptions to the ban were not sufficiently specific. Courts, however, have upheld Ohio’s a ban on partial-birth abortions, which are performed after part of the fetus has been removed from the mother’s body. Partial-birth abortion is associated with late-term pregnancy but the two are not mutually exclusive. There are other abortion procedures, permitted under Ohio law, that can terminate a late-term pregnancy. Although certain late-term abortions are legal, pro-choice advocates say they are only done for medical reasons – not for ""no reason,"" as Fende suggested. Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, said abortion clinics in the state will not perform an abortion if the woman has been pregnant for at least 24 weeks. She said any abortion performed afterward would take place in a hospital for medical reasons. Jessie Hill, a professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law, said abortions when a woman is 8½ months pregnant don’t happen in Ohio for no reason. ""It’s just one of those things that’s unheard of,"" said Hill, who has researched reproductive rights. Hill said she is pro-choice. Michael Gonidakis, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, said that most abortion clinics advertise for abortions at 24 weeks or earlier. But, Gonidakis pointed out, statistics from the Ohio Department of Health show abortions are happening beyond 24 weeks. The statistics do not show whether the abortions are taking place in a hospital or an abortion clinic. But, upon request from the Democrats for Life of Ohio, the Department of Health provided data on the medical condition of women receiving an abortion after they had been pregnant for at least 23 weeks. The data was taken from the abortion reports doctors submitted to the department. The report includes a question about the patient’s medical condition, whether it was ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""other."" Of the 116 abortions in 2009 performed when the woman was reported to be 24 weeks pregnant or more, all of them were listed in good medical condition, according to the Department of Health. So where does this leave us? The law does not explicitly outlaw such an abortion, but state health records show there was just one such case in 2009, and Fende said she did not have the background of that case. And a law professor who is an expert in reproductive rights told us that abortions at 8½ months aren't done for just ""no reason."" Fende’s claim was legally sound. But by itself it does not reflect what the state Department of Health is documenting. That there was just one case out of more than 28,700 abortions in 2009 that fits her statement is an additional piece of information needed to fully understand the claim.

101,30381,"The ""Wall Street Journal"" (or another large news outlet) has published documents leaked from Walter Reed Medical Center which show President Donald Trump's ""true"" weight and prove a conspiracy to mislead the public.","May 16, 2018","Not only is there no evidence of a conspiracy to suppress the president’s “true” weight and mislead the American public, but the “Girther” theory is based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of how the human body can vary from person to person.",Dan MacGuill,"In January 2018, the White House published the results of a routine medical examination performed on President Donald Trump by his then physician, Navy Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Some observers greeted the details of the “periodic physical exam” with skepticism, expressing doubt about Trump’s weight, in particular, which Jackson listed as being 239 pounds, and his height, which he listed as 6’3″. This skepticism, which often comes from individuals who are otherwise critical of the president and his policies, and part of the loosely-defined anti-Trump “Resistance,” has coalesced online into a self-described “Girther” movement, a reference to the “Birther” conspiracy theory which surrounded former president Barack Obama and which was championed by Trump himself. In late April, Jackson was embroiled in controversy after reports emerged of an alleged pattern of drinking to excess while at work, overprescribing medication, and harassing colleagues. As a result of these allegations, Jackson withdrew from consideration for Veterans Affairs Secretary, a position for which Trump had nominated him. Around the same time, the “Girther” movement crystalized into a full-blown conspiracy theory, claiming corrupt practices by the president in nominating Jackson for a cabinet position in return for the favor of — according to the theory — lying about his vital statistics. In the midst of all this innuendo and outright allegation, a viral meme emerged which appeared to some to be the smoking gun. Although the exact wording has varied, the meme typically reads as follows: BREAKING NEWS from [the Wall Street Journal], leaked documents from Walter Reed Hospital shows [sic] [the President of the United States] weight is 289 lbs, [blood pressure] is 154/91, cholesterol is 237. Not quite the healthy person we were told. At 71, Trump could drop dead any time. BREAKING NEWS from WSJ, leaked documents from Walter Reed Hospital shows @POTUS weight is 289 lbs, BP is 154/91, cholesterol is 237. Not quite the healthy person we were told. At 71, #Trump could drop dead any time. pic.twitter.com/rbyAUyVsXi — Tomthunkit™ (@TomthunkitsMind) May 13, 2018  In reality, the Wall Street Journal has not published any leaked documents from Walter Reed regarding Trump’s physical condition. Presidents of the United States are under no legal obligation to make their private health records public, but occupants of the White House (as well as candidates) typically agree to do so as a matter of convention. For someone who has custody over a sitting president’s medical records to disclose those records without the consent of the president would most likely be a serious violation of HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a 1996 law signed by then-president Bill Clinton. HIPAA states: A person who knowingly and in violation of this part — (1) uses or causes to be used a unique health identifier; (2) obtains individually identifiable health information relating to an individual; or (3) discloses individually identifiable health information to another person shall… …(1) be fined not more than $50,000, imprisoned not more than one year, or both; (2) if the offense is committed under false pretenses, be fined not more than $100,000, imprisoned not more than five years, or both; and (3) if the offense is committed with intend to sell, transfer or use individually identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm, be fined not more than $250,000, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both. There is absolutely no evidence that anyone has done this with Trump’s private medical records, nor that the president’s physical condition was not accurately described in Jackson’s January 2018 examination report. The Wall Street Journal has certainly not published anything resembling a “leak” of Trump’s “true” physical examination. Those who attempt to attack the credibility of Trump’s officially-recorded weight by comparing photographs of the president with elite athletes are basing their skepticism on false assumptions about the relationship between height, weight and body fat. Body shapes and types vary from person to person, based on several factors, and not everyone who weighs 239 pounds and is 6’3″ has a muscular build, or is required to have one in order to meet that weight at that height. Dr. Martin Binks is an associate professor of nutritional sciences at Texas Tech University and an expert in obesity and metabolism. While he did not specifically address the case of President Donald Trump, Binks explained the science to us: Observations of weight status made based on a fully clothed individual’s appearance are inappropriate…”Appearance”, when it comes to body composition and health risk, is basically useless (as is weight). Two people of equal height and weight may have vastly different body composition based on relative differences in body fat, bone density, muscle and water retention. Weight by itself is not a “meaningful gauge” of a person’s health, Binks added, and sometimes fat deposits that are not visible to the casual observer can be more strongly associated with health risks than are visible ones: Visceral fat deposits — those for example surrounding and within organs, typically beneath the muscle — are associated with greater health risk. Yet someone may appear to have considerable visible body fat (subcutaneous) immediately beneath the skin, which is associated less strongly with health risk.",false,"Politics, donald trump, girther, girther movement"

But it wasn’t until the end of the three-and-a-half hour affair that viewers finally learned this year’s pick for best picture. The award went to 12 Years a Slave, the powerful true story of a black man kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South during the mid-1800s. In accepting the award, director Steve McQueen delivered an emotional tribute. ""Everyone deserves not just to survive, but to live. This is the most important legacy of Solomon Northup,"" McQueen said. ""I dedicate this award to all the people who have endured slavery. And the 21 million people who still suffer slavery today."" Because we’re PunditFact, we can’t even watch the Oscars without our ears perking up at such a statistic, especially when millions of people potentially heard it, too. So we decided to put McQueen’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. Modern slavery is often referred to today as ""forced labor"" or sometimes ""trafficking in persons."" It’s not as easily defined as the slave trade of the antebellum American South, nor is it simple to identify victims. The United States Trafficking Victims Protection Act defines trafficking in persons two ways. There is sex trafficking ""in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age."" Then there’s a more general category: ""the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery."" There are many different examples of modern slavery worldwide. The International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency, looks for 11 indicators to identify forced labor: Abuse of vulnerability Deception Restriction of movement Isolation Physical and sexual violence Intimidation and threats Retention of identity documents Withholding of wages Debt bondage Abusive working and living conditions Excessive overtime. Estimates on modern slavery vary because victims are difficult to identify and do not often come forward. The United Nation’s International Labor Organization believes the best way to get statistics on slavery is through national surveys, but so far ""only a handful of countries have undertaken special surveys on this topic."" As a result ""the practice is extremely difficult to research and quantify as it is most often hidden and out-of-sight of law enforcement."" Because of this, only 46,570 victims were formally documented by law enforcement agencies internationally in 2012, according to the U.S. State Department’s 2013 Trafficking in Persons Report. Still, overall estimates exist. The International Labor Organization estimated in June 2012 that 20.9 million individuals were in forced labor. This included 15.4 million adults and 5.5 million children. About 55 percent are women or girls. By far, the most common purveyor of forced labor is in Asia, where 11.7 million are in slave-like conditions. Africa is second at 3.7 million. Labor exploitation is most common worldwide with 14.2 million forced laborers, while 4.5 million are exploited for sex. State-enforced labor entraps 2.2 million, the group estimated. The organization has changed how it calculates the figure. As recently as 2005, the estimate for forced laborers was much smaller, at 12 million people, so identifying trends is not possible using their data. Other organizations, however, have estimated that the figure is much higher. Luis CdeBaca, the Ambassador-at-Large in the Office To Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, testified to Congress in 2013 that there were ""up to 27 million people living in slavery."" A State Department spokesman told us that language was agreed to after consulting with industry experts. The Walk Free Foundation, an international organization committed to ending modern slavery, estimates the figure at between 28.3 million and 31.3 million in its Global Slavery Index.

103,23237,"Tom Barrett Says ""Scott Walker says he would ban stem cell research","October 10, 2010",Democratic governor candidate Tom Barrett says Scott Walker would ban stem cell research,Tom Kertscher,"Stem cells hold the potential to treat, and even cure, some of our most deadly and debilitating illnesses, including heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s and diabetes. To make the cells do their magic, research is needed — and the University of Wisconsin has been at the forefront of that work. But for many people, there is a tension between conducting such research and protecting the sanctity of human life. The dilemma confronts not only scientists, but politicians, who are able to set government funding priorities and even place limits on the work scientists do. As in 2006, stem cell research has become an issue in the race for governor. Just as outgoing Gov, Jim Doyle did four years ago, Democratic nominee Tom Barrett is running a TV ad that paints his Republican opponent — Scott Walker — as extreme on the issue. The ad features a mother talking to the camera about her son, who has juvenile diabetes. She describes how stem cell research ""gives our family hope, hope for a cure,"" and she continues with a blunt declaration:  ""Scott Walker says he would ban stem cell research in Wisconsin. That’s right, ban it."" It is the mother making the statement. But as the candidate, Barrett is responsible for the content of the ad. Indeed, as the mother speaks, the words ""Scott Walker says he would ban stem cell research"" appear on the screen. Before we can evaluate the accuracy of Barrett’s claim, we need a brief explanation of stem cells and the current state of science. Here are some key points from a primer by the National Institutes of Health:  Stem cells are important for two reasons: As a generic type of cell, stem cells can renew themselves through cell division. Moreover, they can be induced to become specific tissue or organ cells that have special functions. That gives stem cells their potential to treat, and someday even cure, a number of diseases. Scientists work with two types of stem cells: embryonic and adult. Embryonic stem cells are derived from an embryo, which science defines as the ""developing organism from the time of fertilization until the end of the eighth week of gestation, when it is called a fetus."" Adult stem cells, in contrast, come not from a developing organism but from the body. Embryonic stem cells have a crucial advantage: With regard to treating diseases, embryonic stem cells can become all cell types of the body. Adult stem cells are thought to be limited to differentiating into different cell types of their tissue of origin. The embryonic-adult distinction is critical, though it is not mentioned in the TV ad. The mother in the ad is Heidi Fallone. She and her husband, Edward, are two of the six members of the board of directors of Wisconsin Stem Cell Now, a group that advocates specifically for embryonic stem cell research. Heidi Fallone’s connection to the group is not mentioned in the ad. She is presented as an average mother, with her message packing an emotional wallop as strong as the words: Walker would ban stem cell research. In truth, Walker’s comments on the topic have expressed support for stem cell research generally — but not if it involves embryos. It is a line that many candidates have drawn, including Mark Green, who was the subject of Doyle’s attack in 2006. In his ad, Doyle used a Verona mother, pictured with her young daughter, who has diabetes. The mother said Green would ""outlaw stem cell research."" In the 2010 campaign, Walker and his campaign staff have issued various statements, including two in August, that spell out his position. In one, a day after a U.S. district judge shut down federal funding of all research involving embryonic stem cells, a Walker aide said, ""We can realize the potential of stem cell research without destroying human embryos or resorting to human cloning. We can both protect the earliest stages of life and find cures."" In another statement, also in the wake of the judge’s ruling, Walker himself said that ""science has shown us repeatedly that you can have successful stem cell research without destroying a human embryo."" As an alternative to embryonic stem cell research, researchers have been developing techniques to reprogram adult cells back to the embryonic state. But recent studies have revealed problems. The reprogrammed cells appear to retain a memory of their previous role — as skin, for example — and differ in subtle ways from embryonic stem cells. In response to questions, the Barrett campaign has defended its TV ad. Campaign spokesman Phil Walzak told the Associated Press: ""Embryonic stem cell research is stem cell research, Walker wants to ban it — he wants to ban stem cell research."" The statement, though, shifts the debate. No one disputes that Walker opposes embryonic stem cell research. As additional support, Walzak provided PolitiFact Wisconsin two newspaper articles and a survey Walker completed for the group Pro-Life Wisconsin. But the material, like other items cited,  showed only that Walker opposes embryonic stem cell research, not that he wants to ban all stem cell research. In an interview, Walzak said the Barrett ad is accurate because it is widely known that only embryonic stem cell research — not adult stem cell research — is being debated in terms of a research ban. However, since the ad began running, Barrett has altered his message. An e-mail sent by Barrett’s campaign to supporters, signed by Fallone, says Walker would ban ""critical"" stem cell research. It goes on to criticize Walker’s opposition to embryonic stem cell research. If anything, that underlines how inaccurate the TV ad’s language is. So, where does that leave us? Democrat Tom Barrett is running a TV ad claiming his opponent for governor, Republican Scott Walker, ""would ban stem cell research in Wisconsin."" In truth, Walker has repeatedly said he supports research involving adult stem cells, but opposes research involving embryonic stem cells. That is a critical distinction in the world of science — and of politics. Barrett’s ad ignores it, presenting Walker as so extreme on the matter that he is ""against hope."" We rate Barrett’s claim .",false,"Message Machine 2010, Wisconsin, Tom Barrett, "
105,9293,"Five-Year Follow-Up Study Further Supports Effectiveness and Safety of the Essure® Procedure as a Non-Surgical, Non-Hormonal Option for Permanent Contraception","May 11, 2015","In this news release Bayer HealthCare summarizes a long overdue post-market report on the safety, effectiveness, and tolerability of Essure, an implant and procedure designed to bring about permanent contraception in women. It is the first permanent sterilization alternative to tubal ligation. The Essure implant is a small metal and polyester-like coil that when placed in the fallopian tubes causes an inflammatory response. The resulting scar tissue that develops over a three-month period prevents sperm from entering the fallopian tubes. Given mounting concerns about the safety of this device, it is crucial for any news release addressing safety to present a complete and balanced portrait of clinical research findings. But this news release is unacceptably one-sided. It never mentions that nearly a third of the women originally enrolled in this study dropped out for various reasons that could reflect a bad experience with the device (e.g. adverse events or pregnancy). It also understates the levels of pelvic pain reported by women who did complete the five-year study, and it never discloses that the study’s lead author (and source quoted in the news release) is a paid consultant to Bayer. When Essure was approved in 2002, the FDA required the original manufacturer to monitor the outcomes of women who were enrolled in a clinical trial, upon which the agency’s approval was based, for an additional four years. While this news release summary of the report portrays a successful product and process with few serious side effects, several news stories published days before the news release paint a very different picture. According to articles in the New York Times and other media, thousands of women are now asking the FDA to remove Essure from the market and inform the public about risks associated with the implant. Several others have filed legal action against Bayer, which acquired the implant from Conceptus in 2013. The Times article stated that the FDA has received more than 4,000 adverse event reports on Essure and that the original manufacturer received 16,047 complaints from women who had undergone Essure implants. In addition, ABC News in San Francisco reported that dozens of women staged a protest outside an obstetricians meeting while calling for the implant to be removed from the market. Another ABC affiliate in Arizona reported that the FDA will respond to a “Citizen’s Petition” signed by more than 2,100 women asking that Essure be taken off the market. It’s important that the safety of the device be given a fair public hearing so women considering sterilization can make informed judgments about the implants vis–à–vis tubal ligation. It should be noted that Conceptus, the original manufacturer, failed to report the outcome of the five-year study and that the results were submitted for publication a year after Bayer acquired the device. It’s a disappointment that this summary report was delayed nine long years after the study was completed and 13 years after the FDA approved the device.","Kathlyn Stone,Ranit Mishori, MD, MHS, FAAFP,Kevin Lomangino","There was no discussion of costs associated with the Essure implant procedure. Presumably, the procedure was cost-free for the study participants in this clinical trial, or they received a nominal fee for participating in the trial. However, because the implant has been on the market for 13 years, it would have been beneficial to note the costs and whether the procedure is covered by insurance. An online search revealed the procedure is covered by some, but not all insurance plans. According to Planned Parenthood, costs range between $500 and $2,500. The news release did mention the rates of pregnancies for Essure users in this study — the main purpose of this device being pregnancy prevention. “Among the 364 women relying on Essure inserts….no pregnancies were reported.” But there’s no mention of the fact that women who dropped out of the study may have done so because they got pregnant (more on this below under the Quality of Evidence criterion). And as the study that’s the basis for the release points out, a recent search of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database found that “poststerilization pregnancy” accounted for 61 out of 457 (13.3%) adverse events reported by Essure users. The news release glosses over the harms that are more clearly described in the journal article where the five-year outcomes data are published. The news release states: “The following severe events were reported as being possibly related to the Essure inserts or procedure: one woman with irregular menstrual bleeding, another woman with lower abdominal pain and very heavy periods, and a third woman with continuous bleeding. The latter two resulted in hysterectomy.” However, the journal article notes far more instances of side effects, which we describe in more detail under the Quality of Evidence Section below. Notably, 15 hysterectomies were reported in the study overall, and the cause of five them is unknown. The study investigators deemed the other hysterectomies not “definitely or probably” related to the Essure inserts, according to the study. The news release also summarizes one of the side effects claimed by study participants with this sentence: “Throughout the five-year study, pelvic pain was reported in no more than 7% of study participants at any visit.” However, a chart accompanying the published study states that more than one-third of the initial 518 participants experienced some type of pelvic pain (broken down into dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, ovulatory pain and other), with the highest rates of pain occurring soon after the insertion of the implant. The basic parameters of the study are misleading as presented. The news release states: “Among the 364 women relying on Essure inserts who completed the full five years of follow-up, no pregnancies were reported. In addition, the Essure inserts were generally well tolerated.” That statement is accurate but doesn’t give the full picture. According to the journal article, 518 were originally enrolled. In that case, nearly one-third of the original study group dropped out for one reason or another over the five-year course of the study. Sixty-five women were described as “lost to followup throughout the course of the study,” which implies they may have simply stopped supplying data to the study coordinators. But an additional 22 women left for other reasons that were listed including nine who underwent hysterectomies, eight who “voluntarily terminated,” one who had unsatisfactory device placement, and others for various unrelated reasons. Among an additional 25 women followed for “safety assessments only,” 11 experienced unsatisfactory device location and six underwent subsequent hysterectomy after device placement. Given the relatively small number of volunteers in the study, both the drop out rate and the number of adverse events reported deserved further discussion in this news release. The release doesn’t promote fear-mongering. It is summarizing results from a mandated monitoring study. The news release was clearly authored and provided by Bayer. However, the impression given by the news release is that the study is an independent one, which is not the case. One of the authors (and a person whose quote is used in the news release), John E. Nichols, is also a paid consultant for Bayer as disclosed in the agenda for a recent scientific meeting. Nichols’s relationship with Bayer is not disclosed in the news release (or even in the actual manuscript), and he is quoted as the study’s author. Similarly, the third author, Mark Levie, is a paid consultant for Bayer and on the company’s speaker’s bureau, according to a disclosure from a medical conference. This fact is not disclosed in the news release. It is interesting to note that at the end of the actual manuscript, there is an “acknowledgement” of “Editorial support in the form of manuscript writing, styling and submission” by a paid consultant for Bayer, who is not one of the authors of the study. The practice of employing non-bylined commercial writers in the development of academic manuscripts (a practice sometimes referred to as “ghostwriting”) is widely viewed as a threat to the integrity of academic research. According to rules from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, the authors themselves are granted the authority to determine who meets the criteria to be listed as an author on an academic paper. This subjective standard makes it possible to downplay the role of commercial writers and exaggerate the contributions of academics. Critics of these rules have pointed to the ease with which they are circumvented by industry. This is, perhaps, more about the manuscript than about the news release. However, it would have been nice to know that in the study itself, at least two of the investigators as well as writers are on Bayer’s payroll. The news release says Essure is “the only available hysteroscopic approach,” which is currently true, though there were, at some point, other commercially available systems and devices. More importantly, the news release does not mention other common forms of permanent contraception such as tubal ligation (both regular and laparoscopic). The news release states that the procedure was approved by the FDA in 2002 and further that “Essure is supported by more than a decade of science and real world clinical experience.” In other words, it has already been on the market for 13 years. The novelty of the implant is described in the release as “the only available hysteroscopic approach, does not require incisions and represents an important contraceptive option for women who have completed their families.” We observed no unjustifiable or sensationalistic language.",false,"Bayer,contraception,Device safety,Essure,pregnancy"
108,33932,"Jimmy Carter published an open letter entitled ""Losing My Religion for Equality.","July 22, 2019","Carter truly wrote this letter/op-ed. However, the letter is often shared along with the claim that Carter renounced his faith. But that isn’t the case. While Carter rejected the notion that women were subservient and severed ties with the Southern Baptist Convention, he never turned his back on his own religion. In fact, Carter occasionally taught Sunday school at the Maranatha Baptist Church in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, long after his viral op-ed was published.",Dan Evon,"An op-ed entitled “Losing my Religion for Equality” by former President Jimmy Carter occasionally makes its way around the internet, drawing a mix of reactions and questions from readers. Did Carter really write this? Did he really leave the church? Doesn’t he teach Sunday school? Carter, a third-generation Baptist who has taught Sunday school since the age of 18, turned to his faith often during his political career. In 1995, he reflected on how his faith guided him through his presidency, saying that “there’s no doubt that during my time as president I prayed more intensely and more fervently for God’s guidance than at any other time in my life.” In 2000, however, Carter found himself at odds with the Southern Baptist Convention as the group announced its opposition to women pastors. A few years prior, the group also added a declaration to its essential statement of beliefs stating that wives should be submissive to their husbands. Carter announced that he was severing ties with the organization and sent a letter to 75,000 Baptists across the country. According to The New York Times: Jimmy Carter, a third-generation Southern Baptist and the first United States president to call himself a born-again Christian, has reached what he calls ”a painful decision” to sever ties to the Southern Baptist Convention, saying that parts of its ”increasingly rigid” doctrines violate the ”basic premises of my Christian faith.” Mr. Carter’s decision, announced on Thursday in a letter that is being mailed this week to 75,000 Baptists nationwide, comes four months after the Southern Baptist Convention, the country’s largest Protestant denomination, declared its opposition to women as pastors. In the same doctrinal statement, adopted last June, the group advocated a literal interpretation of the Bible. Two years ago, the group called for wives to be submissive to their husbands. ”I have seen an increasing inclination on the part of Southern Baptist Convention leaders to be more rigid on what is a Southern Baptist and exclusionary of accommodating those who differ from them,” Mr. Carter said today in a brief interview. ”In the last couple of years, this tendency of the Southern Baptist Convention leadership to ordain their creed on others has become more onerous for me and more difficult for me to accept.” The viral opinion piece “Losing my Religion for Equality” was published later in The Observer in July 2009. The entire op-ed can be read here. We’ve reproduced the first few paragraphs below: Women and girls have been discriminated against for too long in a twisted interpretation of the word of God. I HAVE been a practising Christian all my life and a deacon and Bible teacher for many years. My faith is a source of strength and comfort to me, as religious beliefs are to hundreds of millions of people around the world. So my decision to sever my ties with the Southern Baptist Convention, after six decades, was painful and difficult. It was, however, an unavoidable decision when the convention’s leaders, quoting a few carefully selected Bible verses and claiming that Eve was created second to Adam and was responsible for original sin, ordained that women must be “subservient” to their husbands and prohibited from serving as deacons, pastors or chaplains in the military service. This view that women are somehow inferior to men is not restricted to one religion or belief. Women are prevented from playing a full and equal role in many faiths. Nor, tragically, does its influence stop at the walls of the church, mosque, synagogue or temple. This discrimination, unjustifiably attributed to a Higher Authority, has provided a reason or excuse for the deprivation of women’s equal rights across the world for centuries. At its most repugnant, the belief that women must be subjugated to the wishes of men excuses slavery, violence, forced prostitution, genital mutilation and national laws that omit rape as a crime. But it also costs many millions of girls and women control over their own bodies and lives, and continues to deny them fair access to education, health, employment and influence within their own communities. The impact of these religious beliefs touches every aspect of our lives. They help explain why in many countries boys are educated before girls; why girls are told when and whom they must marry; and why many face enormous and unacceptable risks in pregnancy and childbirth because their basic health needs are not met.",true,Politics
111,22510,Unfortunately we have documented instances where people defecated in the (Statehouse) building.,"March 1, 2011",State Sen. Tom Niehaus accuses protesters of defecating in Statehouse,Reginald Fields,"The lasting image thus far surrounding the controversy over Senate Bill 5, a proposal to restrict collective bargaining rights for organized labor, occurred on Feb. 22 when more than 5,000 union workers staged a raucous protest rally with colorful signs and bullhorns outside of the Ohio Statehouse. The protesters’ target was Republican Gov. John Kasich and the GOP-controlled Senate that is pushing the bill. Even Republican Senate President Tom Niehaus the next day grudgingly expressed admiration for the groups’ ability to coordinate so well and make themselves part of the lawmaking process. But right after comments praising the protesters, Niehaus veered in a totally different direction, painting a different lasting image of the protesters at the Statehouse — one not quite so becoming. ""Unfortunately, we have documented instances where people defecated in the building. We have documented instances where they have written on the walls,"" Niehaus said. ""This is the people’s house. I used to say treat it like it’s yours. Well, I don’t want it to be like it’s theirs if that’s the way they treat their own home."" Some union groups responded immediately, denying that a group featuring police officers, firefighters, teachers, nurses and others unionized workers would commit such vile acts in the storied building. So, what gives? It is clear that Kasich and Statehouse Republicans are frustrated by being upstaged by protesters over SB 5 (Thousands more were expected to rally at the Statehouse on Tuesday, March 1). But PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know whether Niehaus’ accusation would hold up on the Truth-O-Meter. Did protesters really defecate in the Statehouse? We asked Niehaus’ staff about the ""documented instances"" and were told that several were reported to the senator and that he confirmed them with Statehouse management. That management is handled by the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board. We called the CSRAB, the curators of the Statehouse, for an accounting of any incidents in the building during the protest. ""There was defecation in the stairwell to the parking garage,"" said CSRAB spokesman Gregg Dodd, but not inside the Statehouse. Furthermore, there is no proof it was left by protesters, and Dodd expressed his doubt. He noted that CSRAB has dealt with this issue before when there are no demonstrations taking place at the Statehouse. ""Unfortunately it happens from time to time even when there are no events going on, and we think it is either a homeless person or persons, or someone waiting for the bus stop,"" Dodd said, explaining that this particular stairwell leads up to the street level where there are stops for the Columbus bus system. The top of the stairwell, at the street level, is enclosed by a small, heated shelter house. There are two of these shelters around the Statehouse. They are used by homeless people to congregate and sleep at night. The area is also along a stretch that is a main transfer area for the city’s transit system. Scores of people gather at various times of the day waiting for buses. ""So, there is no way to determine if that was in fact someone associated with the rally,"" Dodd said regarding the human waste left behind in the stairwell. We’ll give Niehaus a small nod for being right about the writing on the walls. Dodd said there was some writing on the walls inside the Statehouse, but he also noted it was with chalk and was easily cleaned up by the Statehouse maintenance crew. There were also some union stickers stuck to Statehouse floors that needed to be scraped up. But Niehaus’ key accusation dealt with defecation.. In the context of his statement, he clearly was suggesting that protesters soiled the floor, and that it happened inside the Statehouse. As Senate president, Niehaus is one of the most influential people in the state government and when he speaks people listen. Yet this claim is beyond inaccurate. It’s a ridiculous assertion that is unsupported by the people who actually take care of the Statehouse. Statements that are both inaccurate and ridiculous get a special rating on the Truth-O-Meter: .

What's false: Though his work won him grand prize at the annual Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in 2012, his test’s efficacy and accuracy has yet to be demonstrated, and many claims made by Andraka are now recognized by Andraka and others as overhyped.",Alex Kasprak,"On Aug. 22, 2019, The Epoch Times ran a profile of a “15-year-old science buff” who invented a 100% effective diagnostic test for pancreatic cancer. This was a curious editorial decision, as the 15-year-old in question was 22 in 2019, and the more sensational claims he had made years ago had been significantly tempered — facts Andraka himself has acknowledged but that did not make their way into the Epoch Times story. First, here’s what the story gets right. As a 15-year-old, Jack Andraka gained fame for prototyping a potential test for pancreatic cancer that was purportedly quicker and cheaper than existing methods, for which he was awarded the grand prize at the 2012 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. In 2014, then-Forbes healthcare reporter (and current medical reporter at STAT) Matthew Herper described the concept this way: He created a device by dipping filter paper into a solution of carbon nanotubes coated with antibodies for a specific protein that can be elevated in patients with pancreatic cancer. He proved that the device can detect the presence of that protein, mesothelin, in cell culture solutions. He also showed that the sensor could tell the difference between the blood of mice that had human pancreatic tumors grafted onto them and those that did not. Herper, in his capacity as the author of that year’s Forbes 30 under 30 list of promising young scientists, had reviewed a draft of a paper Andraka had written about his test along with six other expert reviewers. In a piece titled “Why Biotech Whiz Kid Jack Andraka Is Not On The Forbes 30 Under 30 List,” he relayed the concerns of five anonymous reviewers and one non-anonymous reviewer: Harvard DNA sequencing pioneer George Church. Church concluded that many of the claims “may not hold up, or at least require more work to be proven.” Others, like the pancreatic cancer researcher who discovered mesothelin in the first place, Ira Paston, had gone further. In a 2015 Sydney Morning Herald piece, Paston stated that the method Andraka proposed “makes no scientific sense,” and that Paston didn’t “know anybody in the scientific community who believes his findings.” Andraka, for his part, has also recognized that the problem is more complex than his earlier statements might have suggested. In an email to Herper in 2014, Andraka wrote: While promising, the project really was extremely preliminary and is by no means as sophisticated as some stories say it is … I realize that in retrospect that it was just a high school science fair project and it was a proof of concept experiment and initially I thought that it could get on the market in 1-2 years however I’ve learned so much over the course of this journey and realized that it will in reality take a lot longer than this. Here we get into the weeds of the claims made (most recently) by The Epoch Times, but which form the basis of other continually recurring clickbait stories. In a 2012 TEDx Talk, among other places, Andraka stated that his test was “168 times faster, 26,000 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive.” Any reporting citing these numbers is merely repeating, uncritically, claims which misrepresent the time and cost of existing technology. One of the few existing methods for pancreatic cancer detection is via ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) tests. Specifically, ELISA tests that identify the presence of a chemical known as CA 19-9 can be evidence of tumors in some cases of pancreatic cancer. According to Church, Andraka’s time comparison overstates the amount of time such ELISA tests take. The comparison Andraka used was 14 hours. ELISA, however, is fairly quick these days. A modern CA 19-9 ELISA panel, for example, takes 1.5 hours to run. Suggesting it takes 14 hours inflates significantly the speed comparison in favor of Andraka’s test. Church also stated that the cost comparison employed by Andraka was flawed because it compared only the manufacturing costs on his invention’s side but included profit and overhead on the ELISA test side: Andraka is comparing the commercial cost for a test – including the manufacturer’s profit and overhead – to his own materials cost. That’s not a fair comparison. He says the only mesothelin test that he found cost $912 per kit. But other ELISA tests are for sale online for $400 per 60 tests or $600 for 96 tests – in other words, about $6.50 per test run. That still compares favorably to Andraka’s $3 per 10 tests, but remember that there would also be a commercial markup if a company decided to sell his tests. As for sensitivity, Church argued that the results presented by Andraka varied too much to say anything about sensitivity (a measure that gets at potential false positives). Andraka was able to spend six months in the lab of a Johns Hopkins Medical Center researcher where he tested his test using blood from mice who had pancreatic cancer compared to those who didn’t. Such tests, even if they produced promising results, would not be the same as demonstrating efficacy as a diagnostic tool for pancreatic cancer in humans. Outside of accuracy — i.e., the ability to correctly identify humans with pancreatic cancer — the early detection of the disease was also central to the project, something Andraka would not have been able to test directly for his work at Hopkins. Ira Pastan, the National Cancer Institutes researcher who discovered mesothelin, the biomarker used in Andraka’s test, told The Sydney Morning Herald that the protein is not actually elevated in the blood in early pancreatic cancer patients and thus could not be indicative of the early stages of the disease. Other scientific studies support Pastan’s objection. A 2013 study into the diagnostic efficacy of mesothelin on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (a form of pancreatic cancer) concluded that the biomarker was “a weak diagnostic classifier on its own” but may be of use as part of a larger panel test. Mesothelin is also present in cases of other cancers as well, including “malignant mesothelioma and … ovarian, and lung adenocarcinomas. In a 2015 statement provided to Sydney Morning Herald reporter Nick Bryant by John Hopkins University, the institution made clear the results were far too preliminary to declare such accuracy or to speculate on its future success: “[Andraka’s’] idea was considered by his mentor to be of scientific interest,” the hospital told me in a written statement, “but his experiments at Johns Hopkins were highly preliminary.” They represented nothing more than “the very earliest stages of determining whether such a test is feasible or likely”. It also noted that his results had not been confirmed, peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal. “Thus, it is unlikely that a test based on his idea will soon be available to people.” Andraka does not hold an international patent on his device. Although he applied for one in 2012, that application was ultimately denied based on lacking an “inventive step.” All told, media outlets like The Epoch Times continue to run with an out-of-date and highly clickable fairytale that has not been accurate since at least 2014. Andraka himself acknowledges the shortcomings of his earlier scientific pronouncements and is thankful for the criticism he has received, telling (for example) The Sydney Morning Herald in 2015 that “I really appreciate their concerns because their concerns made my project better. It was definitely a learning curve.”",false,Medical

This not a rant, this is from me, still one of the leading cybersecurity experts. Wake up people! — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) October 3, 2018  In this post, we’ll describe the myriad hurdles McAfee’s argument would need to overcome to be accurate, noting that we could find no independent support for the claims he made in that tweet. What is the Presidential Alert System? The “presidential alert” tested on 3 October 2018 combined a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System, or EAS (which is familiar to people as cacophonous weather and/or natural disaster alerts that might interrupt television or radio broadcasts) and the Wireless Emergency Alert system, or WEA (which is familiar to cell phone users who have received Amber alerts or other local emergency alerts). Typically, the WEA system is used by state and local jurisdictions, but the October 2018 test was the first attempt at trying out a nationwide alert via this system for the purposes of conveying a message from the President. Based on a George W. Bush-era law, anyone with a cell phone can opt out of any WEA notification unless that notification is “issued at the direction of the President and/or his/her designee.” While the law has required the EAS to be tested nationwide for the past three years, October 2018 was the first time such a test had been combined with a test of a nationwide WEA alert. What Is John McAfee’s Argument? In a brief phone interview, McAfee explained to us his view that a nationwide WEA notification could be exploited by the federal government to spy on private citizens. He suggested this could be done by exploiting what he called an “E911 chip”. He characterized the purpose of this chip as something 911 dispatchers can use to find location information for people who call 911 and either hang up or are incapacitated during the call: Let’s say a burglar enters your house, assaults you, you call 911, you pass out during the call. They again turn on your camera, your phone, get your location, dispatch police officers. They can then listen to see if there is anyone else in the room. Is there any noise? The location of the camera, whatever it’s showing, they can see that. Perfect, that’s good. I don’t think anybody would have a problem with that. We will discuss the accuracy of that statement later in this post. However, McAfee’s argument, generally speaking, is that because (he says) the WEA utilizes this “E911 chip,” they too have the ability to turn on your phone and spy on you: The Federal Government has co-opted a local facility (e.g.,. a 911 call center). Let’s say you want to know where you’ve got a bunch of enemies or a bunch of Republicans or some Democrats, you want to know where they are, what they’re doing. When you send an alert it doesn’t have to make a sound. It doesn’t have to display anything because it’s listening, watching you, to find out where you are, where you’re moving. What is an E911 Chip? According to Ted Rappaport, a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NYU and the founding director of their NYU WIRELESS research center, “There is no such thing as an E911 chip in a cell phone.” Nomenclature aside, McAfee appears to be referring to the technology required by the FCC of modern cellular phones and network providers that assures 911 call centers receive accurate geolocation from mobile phones. The regulations that require such capabilities are broadly referred to as E911 rules. The enhanced 911 (E911) rules were implemented by the FCC in two phases and were aimed at improving “the effectiveness and reliability of wireless 911 services by providing 911 dispatchers with additional information on wireless 911 calls.” Phase I required cell phones to be capable of communicating to a 911 call center which cellphone tower was utilized in an emergency call. Phase II required wireless carriers “to begin providing information that is more precise to [call centers], specifically, the latitude and longitude of the caller.” The FCC mandated that the accuracy of that information had to meet certain standards depending upon the type of technology used. Most modern cell phones use a combination of two methods to generate that location information: A “network-based” solution which triangulates a caller’s location from the cell phone towers near it, and a “headset-based” solution which is generally a GPS receiver built into the phone. Most modern cell phones contain a GPS receiver chip. It is this chip, McAfee argued to us, that a presidential alert system could exploit. Does The Wireless Emergency Alert System Use an “E911 Chip”? McAfee asserted that the action of sending out a nationwide alert necessitates access to the GPS or other location services (i.e. the “E911 chip”) that are part of your phone. FEMA, the federal agency that oversees the WEA, disputes this view, with a FEMA spokesperson telling us: The cell phone functions that receive and display WEA messages are not related or connected to E911 functions in any way. The majority of wireless providers in the United States use Cell Broadcast technology to deliver WEA alert messages to cell phones. Cell Broadcast is a one-way communications protocol. Phones that receive WEA messages choose to display the message if the phone is not busy in a phone call or data session. The WEA message display function in a phone does not use the GPS, microphone, or camera functions of the phone. In essence, what happens when any WEA alert (including Amber alerts and severe weather alerts) go out is that the cell towers in the targeted region will broadcast a signal to all cell phones within receiving distance. This is a passive process, and as such the tower does not require, nor does it obtain, information from the phones that receive the message. The only differences between a “Presidential alert” and any other WEA alert a phone might already receive are that 1) cell phones are not capable of opting out of WEA notifications from the President according to FCC policy, and 2) WEA notifications target the entire country, not a smaller geographic region. Could a WEA Alert Exploit Your Phone’s Hardware and Expose Its Location? Because a WEA notification is a passively received signal, it does not add to the list of potential security vulnerabilities in a phone. For that reason, McAfee’s thesis that the presidential alert is itself a security risk does not hold up. That does not mean, however, that your phone and the software it runs on do not have access to a scary amount of personal data, or that it is not constantly tracking your location and recording you. According to Rappaport, the NYU professor, users almost always (without their knowledge) “opt-in” to a variety of services that utilize the kind of information McAfee is concerned with: It is true that various smartphone operating systems, such as Android and iOS, do collect and process the microphone data of unwitting users, and that our locations and voices are indeed being tracked and mined, processed, and known to the cellphone smartphone operating system, and this information, or processed versions of it, are exchanged between the cell phone’s operating system and the end servers across the internet that communicate with the end user applications … A person’s location information and audio recordings (or processed versions of the recordings) are supposed to be only used when a customer has “opted in” to use these applications, and when the application has been downloaded on to its phone). If you read the fine print of both the Android and IOS operating systems … you will be amazed at what users are agreeing to for the use of their data. This type of data is often used by social media sites (Google, Facebook, etc.) to target their advertising to us. As an experiment, you can talk about your pet, and what you feed your pet, and after a few minutes, you will then find a Facebook ad about pet food in your Facebook feed — I have many of my friends try this, and they are amazed and then quite shaken up. Outside of the issue of a WEA alert’s being a passive signal, McAfee’s thesis also requires accepting the notion that 911 operators have access to those same datasets (the ones described by Rappaport) constantly being created by your phone. That portion of the argument is a bit more factual. As an example, Apple’s iOS 12 system, which was released in September 2018, utilizes a service that collects and packages your location data to be sent to a 911 center should you make a call: Apple today announced it will also use emergency technology company RapidSOS’s Internet Protocol-based data pipeline to quickly and securely share [GPS and networked derived] location data with 911 centers, improving response time when lives and property are at risk. RapidSOS’s system will deliver the emergency location data of iOS users by integrating with many 911 centers’ existing software, which rely on industry-standard protocols … In keeping with Apple’s focus on privacy, user data cannot be used for any non-emergency purpose and only the responding 911 center will have access to the user’s location during an emergency call. We reached out to RapidSOS for a comment on the claims made by McAfee but have not received a response. We have found no evidence, though, that this process could be flipped in reverse, whereby a 911 call center (or any other party) could access this information without your first calling 911. In fact, based on RapidSOS’s literature, their data transfer process is effectively a one-way signal as well. In their process, your location data is constantly updated and sent to a NG911 (next generation 911) data clearinghouse which is then (if you make a 911 call) transmitted to a call center and displayed alongside the other location data they would normally receive. These data could theoretically include other sources of information, but a user would have to opt-in to those features explicitly. We asked McAfee how he knows that the government, via the introduction of a nationwide alert system, could gain access to this kind of data in a way that did not previously exist before the alert system, and he told us that while no documented evidence of any legislation allowing for such a process existed, “every great security person knows” it: There is no evidence that any legislation gave the government the power to co-opt the 911 call. It was something that was intended to be activated only if I’m in trouble and call the police. Is now being used by the government to send text messages under the pretext of [a test]. I’m the world’s greatest cyber security specialist, which is basically one of the greatest hackers. I know that because every great cyber security person knows this. People have taken that chip, taken it apart a thousand times. Regardless of what chip McAfee is referring to, his claim rests on the notion that receiving a WEA alert requires governmental access to the geolocation services utilized by 911 centers, a claim which we have found no evidence to support and which FEMA denies. While cell phones do collect data on users (effectively) without their knowledge and do so constantly, we could identify no mechanism by which the perils presented by that reality were in anyway expanded by a presidential alert, since those alerts merely use the same technology that cell phones have employed to receive weather and Amber alerts for years.",false,Technology
116,37974,"Former Vice President Joe Biden received five medical deferments, allowing him to avoid serving in the Vietnam War.","September 16, 2020",Did Joe Biden Receive Five Deferments During the Vietnam War?,  Arturo Garcia  ,"Contrary to what critics claim, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s non-combatant status during the Vietnam War was not underreported prior to his 2020 campaign.Regardless, one Facebook user amassed more than 189,000 shares by claiming, “Won’t see this anywhere” above a high school photograph of Biden and the caption, “Lifeguard/football player Joe Biden got five draft deferments for asthma during Vietnam.”Biden publicly discussed his deferments in a Washington Post profile published in June 1987, amid his first presidential campaign:Biden says he received a draft notice after graduating from law school, but failed the physical because of an asthma condition. He had hoped to be a pilot.“My feeling about it at the time was like a lot of things in my life have been: That there must have been a reason for it. I was prepared to go. I was not anxious to go, because I didn’t think, ‘My God, I can hardly wait to go and join the military. '”After Biden was tapped as U.S. President Barack Obama’s running mate in September 2008, their campaign released Biden’s Selective Service records following a request by the Associated Press, which subsequently reported:According to the documents, Biden, 65, received several deferments while he was an undergraduate at the University of Delaware and later as a law student at Syracuse University. A month after undergoing a physical exam in 1968, Biden received a Selective Service classification of 1-Y, meaning he was available for service only in the event of national emergency.“As a result of a physical exam on April 5, 1968, Joe Biden was classified 1-Y and disqualified from service because of asthma as a teenager,” said David Wade, a campaign spokesman.In “Promises to Keep,” a memoir that was published last year and became an instant bestseller after he was tapped as Obama’s running mate, Biden never mentions his asthma, recounting an active childhood, work as a lifeguard and football exploits in high school.Biden’s opponent in the 2020 presidential election, incumbent Donald Trump, also received five deferments during the war, one of which he has claimed was due to bone spurs in his heels.But Trump’s account has come under question on several occasions.In December 2018, the daughters of Dr. Larry Braunstein told the New York Times that Braunstein, a podiatrist, had told them prior to his death in 2007 that he did Trump’s father “a favor” in providing him a diagnosis qualifying him for deferment from the war:“What he got was access to Fred Trump,” Elysa Braunstein said. “If there was anything wrong in the building, my dad would call and Trump would take care of it immediately. That was the small favor that he got.”No paper evidence has been found to help corroborate the version of events described by the Braunstein family, who also suggested there was some involvement by a second podiatrist, Dr. Manny Weinstein. Dr. Weinstein, who died in 1995, lived in two apartments in Brooklyn owned by Fred Trump; city directories show he moved into the first during the year Donald Trump received his exemption.Dr. Braunstein’s daughters said their father left no medical records with the family, and a doctor who purchased his practice said he was unaware of any documents related to Mr. Trump. Most detailed government medical records related to the draft no longer exist, according to the National Archives.Two months later, the president’s former attorney Michael Cohen testified to federal lawmakers that Trump admitted to faking the injury. As the Military Times reported:“Mr. Trump claimed [his medical deferment] was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery,” Cohen told members of the House Oversight Committee. “He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment.“He finished the conversation with the following comment: ‘You think I’m stupid, I wasn’t going to Vietnam. '”Trump was further criticized following a September 2020 report in The Atlantic saying that he referred to dead U.S. soldiers as “losers” and “suckers.”That same month, Trump was also criticized by Creedence Clearwater Revival singer/songwriter John Fogerty for using his song “Fortunate Son” — which took aim at the abuse of deferments by the rich to avoid serving in Vietnam.“I find it confusing, I would say, that the president has chosen to use my song for his political rallies, when in fact it seems like he is probably the fortunate son,” Fogerty told Rolling Stone.Comments",true,"Fact Checks, Politics"

His figure strikes us as worthy of skepticism partly because research on this topic seems to be driven by up-front assumptions--some of them fiercely debated. As troubling, the figure reflects 2009 estimates reached using a previous estimate of how much of such costs were passed through in 2005, nearly a decade ago. We found no post-2009 state-by-state estimates of the cost impact, while other analyses have found that although cost-shifting occurs, private insurance rates are not greatly affected. This claim, which retains an element of truth.",W. Gardner Selby,"Bexar County’s top elected official gave a pocketbook reason for Texas to expand Medicaid as encouraged by the federal health care law known as Obamacare. Nelson Wolff, the county’s judge, prefaced his April 1, 2013, remarks by saying he had just received a root canal. ""Getting Medicaid expansion in Texas is more painful,"" Wolff said during a Capitol press conference with Democratic lawmakers and other advocates. Earlier that day, Gov. Rick Perry and other Republican leaders had reiterated their opposition to expanding Medicaid, which they termed a costly, broken program. Wolff, saying he was speaking for the state’s major public hospital districts, said that if Medicaid is expanded, ""it would cut down"" on emergency room visits, ""on unnecessary patients going there and help people that really, really do need it."" Wolff then said it’s estimated that some $1,800 is added to ""your private insurance rates"" due to uncompensated care given by ""hospitals throughout Texas,"" a figure we spotted in Patricia Kilday Hart’s April 2, 2013, Houston Chronicle column on the press conference. Is that so? Concern about such cost shifting is even written into the federal health care law, as noted by Hoover Institution fellow and Stanford University professor John F. Cogan and others in a 2011 paper. The 2010 law says ""the cost of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured was $43 billion in 2008. To pay for this cost, health care providers pass on the cost to private insurers, which pass on the cost to families. This cost-shifting increases family premiums by on average over $1,000 a year."" By email, Bexar County spokeswoman Laura Jesse told us the judge drew the $1,800 figure from a March 24, 2009, report from the Washington-based Center for American Progress, which says it was founded to ""provide long-term leadership and support to the progressive movement."" The report says that nationally in 2009, this cost-shift amounted to $1,100 per average family premium and $410 per average individual premium, with the Texas cost-shift being $1,800 per average family premium and $630 per average individual premium, according to a chart. Case closed? Not so fast, because research conflicts over the extent of cost-shifting. Also, there is uncertainty the amounts can be estimated state to state. Vicki Anderson of Austin, who helped write a January 2013 report commissioned by Texas Impact and Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas, Inc. on projected local tax effects of expanding Medicaid, told us by email that pinning down the impact of uncompensated care on private insurance rates is challenging in part because such calculations inevitably start from varying amounts of spending attributed to uncompensated care, causing the estimated effect on private insurance premiums to vary as well. Nationally, PolitiFact colleagues have noted that the study cited by Wolff, which updated figures developed in a 2005 analysis commissioned by the liberal-leaning Families USA, has been contradicted by more recent analyses estimating such cost-shifting to be far less costly. Let’s look at the approach that delivered the figure aired by Wolff and then at the contradictory reports. For each state, the Center for American Progress said it assumed the same percentage increases in premiums due to such cost-shifting in 2009 that the Families USA report earlier estimated for 2005. The center then applied the percentages to the latest state-by-state premium data as reported by a federal panel, according to its report, also growing each resulting figure by the change in national private health expenditures as reported and tracked by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2006 to 2009. We didn’t find a copy of the 2005 report, but Families USA issued a 2009 report, ""Hidden Health Tax: Americans Pay a Premium,"" describing follow-up research it commissioned from Milliman, Inc., an actuarial consulting firm, that drew on federal data on medical spending to conclude that in 2008, uncompensated care costs drove up average private family insurance rates nationally by $1,017. The report says the methodology was similar, though not identical, to the one used for its 2005 study. The report did not present state-by-state figures. By phone, Families USA analyst Kathleen Stoll told us: ""I didn’t feel we could pin it down state by state."" A report appendix says the research assumed that the cost of all uncompensated care is shifted to the insured. But Stoll, elaborating, told us researchers reached the ""cost"" figure in its report in a couple steps. First, she said, the group estimated total charges to the uninsured not covered by the patients themselves or sources like charity care or federal aid sent to hospitals for that purpose. The resulting figure was then discounted by 49 percent to reflect the share of total charges that a hospital or other provider would need to shift to insured patients to ""operate at the same margins as they do when they set charges for services that are covered by insurance reimbursement,"" Stoll emailed. Studies that have led to considerably lower estimates of the impact of cost-sharing on private insurance rates do not assume the same level of pass-through costs. In an August 2008 Health Affairs article, noted in a February 2013 PolitiFact Ohio fact check, George Mason University professor Jack Hadley and others said that ""cost shifting as a result of uncompensated care probably has only a very small impact on private insurance premiums."" Specifically, the authors said, the amount potentially associated with cost shifting represents at most 1.7 percent of private health insurance costs. The analysis had no state-by-state cost-shift estimates. By telephone, Hadley told us the research drew on hospital spending on uncompensated care over 20 years and looks at how much privately insured patients were charged for care. He said private insurance costs were more likely to be affected by Medicare rates or the relative concentration of hospitals in communities than ups and downs in expenditures on uncompensated care. Summing up, Hadley said, it does not follow that family private insurance policies in Texas cost $1,800 more due to cost shifting, though he sees a public-relations appeal to such statements. The actual effect of cost-shifting might be $150 to $200 per private family policy, he said. In contrast, he said, most uncompensated care is paid for by government, meaning tax revenue. Informed of Hadley’s analysis, California consultant Peter Harbage, an author of the center report cited by Wolff, said by email that Hadley’s analysis counted certain expenditures, such as government aid for graduate medical education, as helping to cover the costs of the uninsured. Those assumptions are wrong, Harbage said, or at least not entirely correct. We were getting the picture: Different researchers started from conflicting assumptions, which are open to dispute. Earlier, in September 2009, PolitiFact identified major disagreement on the significance of cost-shifting and rated as Half True a claim by President Barack Obama that families were paying $900, on average, ""in higher premiums because of uncompensated care."" Obama’s claim echoed the Families USA studies. But in 2008, the respected Kaiser Family Foundation released a report questioning the methodology of the initial Families USA study and hypothesizing that cost-shifting is not that significant. Let's step back and explain what the experts are counting. They use federal data on medical expenditures to calculate the total amount spent on care for the uninsured. Then they subtract whatever the uninsured themselves paid for care, then what government and charities paid. The remainder of the cost is what people with insurance are paying for through higher premiums, according to Families USA. The Kaiser study documented fluctuations in private premiums over many years, and concluded that the data don't seem to correlate with costs for the uninsured. Rather, cost-shifting is ""more strongly related to fluctuations in payments by Medicare and Medicaid,"" Kaiser said. The Kaiser study also did not set a per-policy cost-shift figure the way the Families USA study did. Kaiser said instead that cost-shifting might account for 1.7 percent of all private premiums. So, who is right? PolitiFact in Washington reviewed the Families USA and Kaiser studies and did not see obvious problems or conflicts. Barring fresh evidence, the differences seemed to reflect genuine disagreement among experts about methodological approaches to a complex issue. By phone, Harbage told us the Kaiser researchers approached the cost-shifting analysis with two major differences from how Families USA tackled the topic. Kaiser, he said, assumed more government spending on the uninsured, reducing the costs that could be shifted to private insurance rates, and also did not assume that every health care provider invariably maximizes profits, which Families USA did. ""Smart people can come to different conclusions,"" he said. Our ruling Wolff said uncompensated health care costs absorbed by Texas hospitals are adding $1,800 a year to private insurance rates. His figure strikes us as worthy of skepticism partly because research on this topic seems to be driven by up-front assumptions--some of them fiercely debated. As troubling, the figure reflects 2009 estimates reached using a previous estimate of how much of such costs were passed through in 2005, nearly a decade ago.

120,9210,Zinc eaten at levels found in biofortified crops reduces 'wear and tear' on DNA,"January 10, 2017","This news release describes a new study looking at the correlation between zinc intake and DNA damage and consequently makes a case for biofortified crops like zinc rice and zinc wheat. Although the release does an exemplary job explaining the role zinc plays in our bodies, it doesn’t quite explain how this brief, small trial of 18 healthy men demonstrates the impact of zinc on cellular health. It uses vague, broad language to describe the study’s findings and dedicates only one sentence to detail the study design. Part news release, part policy article and part biofortification promotion, the release argues for the need for food-based interventions, like crop biofortification, to address malnutrition and mineral deficiency around the world based on a small study of 18 healthy American men. That may be due to the fact that the research was funded by HarvestPlus, a research program advocating for biofortification to breed higher levels of micronutrients directly into staple food crops. We wish this funding source was disclosed in the news release, as well as the question of how prevalent the practice of biofortification already is around the world. Most US news releases relate studies like this one to dietary supplements, but this news release addresses hidden hunger and malnutrition. Zinc deficiency is a public health issue in many developing countries, especially those with rice-based diets. Access to seafood, red meat and poultry (foods rich in zinc) is also a challenge for many vulnerable populations. If crop biofortification is proven to be a safe, reliable and cost-effective way to deliver essential vitamins and minerals to nutrient-deficient populations, then it should be seen as a much needed food-based intervention to improve global health.","Euna Bodner, MS,Kathleen Fairfield, MD, DrPH,Kathlyn Stone","Although zinc can be found in everyday foods such as oysters and red meat, the mineral can also be taken as a dietary supplement. A bottle of 100 zinc tablets goes for about $4 to $6 at the local drug store. Since there is no discussion of costs in this news release, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. There is absolutely no discussion of any benefit data in the news release. Only vague, sweeping language is used to describe the effect of increased zinc intake. For example, the release states that the addition of 4 milligrams of extra zinc a day “can have a profound, positive impact on cellular health that helps fight infections and diseases” and “reduce oxidative stress and damage to DNA.” In addition, the news release does not describe how the benefit was measured. It only mentions that scientists “used the parameter of DNA damage to examine the influence of zinc on healthy living.” How did scientists exactly count DNA strand breaks? We would have liked to have seen some numbers here, which is why we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating. We wish the news release mentioned that too much zinc is also harmful. According to the National Institutes of Health, increased zinc intake could lead to nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, stomach cramps, diarrhea and headaches. When people take too much zinc for a long time, they sometimes have problems such as low copper levels, lower immunity and low levels of HDL cholesterol — sometimes referred to as the “good” cholesterol. While this study was about food fortified with zinc, the news release was vague about how people should acquire their zinc, and this confusion could encourage people to reach for a bottle of zinc supplements. For this reason, we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating. Only one sentence was dedicated to the study design. We only know from the news release that the six-week study was randomized and controlled, as “scientists measured the impact of zinc on human metabolism.” We aren’t told how many people participated in the trial, how they took the zinc (through meals or supplementation), how much zinc was given and whether the study was blinded. According to the original journal article, it turns out only 18 men took part in the trial. There was no control group per se, but participants were put on a controlled diet, in which zinc was depleted for two weeks and then repleted for the next four weeks. The study was not blinded. We feel the news release should have pointed out that all of these factors introduce potential for bias into the trial. Here’s one more point: Reducing DNA damage does not necessarily translate into better health outcomes, like increased life expectancy or lower rates of cardiovascular disease. Our bodies normally have mechanisms to repair DNA damage, which happens on a daily basis. And how are scientists so confident that zinc was specifically responsible for these lower numbers of DNA strand breaks? We would have liked to have seen more discussion on the study design and limitations, which is why we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating here. There is no explicit disease mongering in this news release. However, the reference to “excessive DNA damage” from insufficient zinc consumption and the statement that “Zinc also helps limit inflammation and oxidative stress in our body, which are associated with the onset of chronic cardiovascular diseases and cancers” could plant fear in some readers’ minds. None of the authors reported conflicts of interest related to the study. The research was supported by a grant from HarvestPlus, a research program advocating for biofortification to breed higher levels of micronutrients — like iron, zinc and vitamin A — directly into staple food crops. Additional funding came from the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements. The news release does not disclose these funding sources, which is why we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. The alternatives here are to eat more natural foods rich in zinc or to take dietary supplements. Some sources of zinc include oysters, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts, whole grains and breakfast cereals. Supplements contain several forms of zinc, including zinc gluconate, zinc sulfate and zinc acetate. According to the National Institutes of Health, research has not established whether differences exist among forms of zinc in absorption, bioavailability or tolerability. As we mentioned in the Costs section, a bottle of 100 zinc tablets is priced around $4 to $6. Since these alternatives are not discussed, we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating. We wish the news release could have talked more about existing zinc fortification efforts around the world, since it’s not clear in the release whether zinc fortification practices are already in place. In the original journal article, researchers mention the zinc fortification programs initiated in more than 30 countries and point out how Bangladesh increased its rice zinc concentration by 50 percent through its biofortification methods. For this reason, we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating. The news release states that this research is the first to show how modest increases in dietary zinc reduces oxidative stress and damage to DNA. The news release does not include unjustifiable, sensational language.",false,"UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland,zinc"

126,17533,Nearly 40 percent of his McAllen-area constituents suffer from obesity.,"January 7, 2014","Lucio said nearly 40 percent of his McAllen-area constituents suffer from obesity. McAllen’s metropolitan statistical area in 2012 had 38.5 percent obesity among adults, according to the Gallup-Healthways study. A state survey that year suggested that nearly 45 percent of the region’s residents were obese.",Sue Owen,"Longtime state Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville, highlighted two problems that come together in his district at the Southern Obesity Summit in Nashville, Tenn. Noting that Brownsville and McAllen are among the poorest cities in the U.S., Lucio said, ""Because higher rates of poverty are associated with poorer health care outcomes, it should come as no surprise that McAllen is also one of the most obese areas of the country,"" according to his prepared remarks for the opening session Nov. 17, 2013. ""Nearly 40 percent of my constituents there suffer,"" he said. Lucio cited via email an April 12, 2013, McAllen Monitor news story which said the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission region was ""the fattest metro area in the United States"" in 2012 based on a Gallup poll. He emailed us a link to the Gallup report released April 11, 2013, which drew on the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, an annual effort to analyze factors including social, financial and physical conditions of U.S. adults. Gallup used Hidalgo County as the boundary for the McAllen metropolitan statistical area. Only the southeastern part of Hidalgo County is in Lucio’s District 27, according to the Texas Legislative Council’s map, but we did not find a more precise breakdown of obesity statistics. By phone, Gallup-Healthways research director Dan Witters told us that the index uses information gathered nationwide in English and Spanish phone interviews. The survey reached about 350,000 U.S. adults throughout 2012 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 0.2 percentage points. Witters emailed us results for the nine largest Texas metropolitan statistical areas, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, where Gallup-Healthways was able to field 300 or more responses in 2012. Insufficient responses excluded Brownsville-Harlingen, which would have been ninth-largest out of the ten top MSAs. Of the nine regions, the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission metro area had the highest share of obese residents: 38.5 percent. Austin-Round Rock was the skinniest, at 22.7 percent. Percentage of obese residents in nine of the 10 largest Texas MSAs for 2012, Gallup-Healthways: McAllen-Edinburg-Mission -- 38.5% Beaumont-Port Arthur -- 32.5% San Antonio -- 31.4% Corpus Christi -- 31.2% Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington -- 26.7% El Paso -- 26.7% Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown -- 26.6% Killeen-Temple-Fort Hood --  25.3% Austin-Round Rock -- 22.7% Nationally, Boulder, Colo., was Gallup-Healthways’ skinniest metropolitan statistical area with 12.5 percent obesity. The nationwide average was 26.2 percent. To calculate obesity, Witters said, Gallup-Healthways asked respondents for their height and weight, then calculated body-mass index, with a BMI of 30 or above considered obese. (To find yours, the National Institutes of Health say, ""Multiply your weight in pounds by 703. Divide that answer by your height in inches. Divide that answer by your height in inches again."" Or use an online calculator like these.) Witters said that In phone interviews, ""men tend to say they’re taller, women say they’re a bit lighter"" than they are. Gallup-Healthways did not modify its results to account for this, he said, but as a general rule of thumb adding 20 percent to 25 percent to BMI corrects for such self-reporting. Seeking another indicator of obesity in the McAllen region and elsewhere in Texas, we turned to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That agency defines the state’s metropolitan statistical areas differently than the federal government -- for example, splitting Dallas/Plano/Irving from Fort Worth/Arlington -- but like Gallup used Hidalgo County as the McAllen region. The McAllen area topped a 2012 list of large metro areas that spokeswoman Christine Mann gave us by phone. Percentage of obese residents in seven of the largest Texas MSAs for 2012, Department of State Health Services: McAllen-Edinburg-Pharr -- 44.7% El Paso MSA -- 34.1% Fort Worth-Arlington -- 31.8% San Antonio MSA -- 28.9% Houston-Baytown-Sugar Land -- 27% Dallas-Plano-Irving -- 26.5% Mann said the average for Texas in 2012 was 29.2 percent. Texas’ health services department collects its data in the annual Texas Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey, and like Witters noted that people tend to underreport their health risk factors in phone interviews. The 2012 BRFSS was conducted throughout the year; the BMI portion had 8,530 respondents and a 95 percent confidence interval, Mann said. Our ruling Lucio said nearly 40 percent of his McAllen-area constituents suffer from obesity. McAllen’s metropolitan statistical area in 2012 had 38.5 percent obesity among adults, according to the Gallup-Healthways study. A state survey that year suggested that nearly 45 percent of the region’s residents were obese.

The data show that among countries more like America economically, nations with stricter regulation have much lower rates of gun-related homicides. South Africa has tougher laws but is much poorer, and it is the only exception. Bolling described a pattern that does not exist.",Jon Greenberg,"The murders of two television journalists in Virginia renewed the debate about gun control in America. On Fox News’ The Five, panelist Juan Williams said he feels more threatened by the number of guns on the street in New York and Washington, D.C., than he does by the militant Muslim group ISIS. Show co-host Eric Bolling shot back, ""In countries where there are higher, more strict gun laws, there is more gun violence."" We decided to see if Bolling had his facts straight. We couldn’t find proof that he did, and neither Bolling nor Fox News got back to us to show otherwise. There is no hard and fast yardstick to compare gun laws across nations, but there are some rough indicators. The United States is unusual in framing gun ownership as a right, so at the most basic legal level, most countries begin from a more restrictive starting point. There’s helpful data on gun regulation in other countries from the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. According to the group’s 2011 small arms survey, personal protection is not a sufficient reason to own a weapon in Australia and the United Kingdom. In fact, in the United Kingdom, the 1996 slayings of 16 school children in Scotland led to a ban on private handguns. Japan also bans handguns. Canada requires all would-be gun owners to get a license to own a gun. They must pass a background check and complete a safety course. If they then go and buy a weapon, they must register it. They can buy a gun for personal protection, but they must show that they face an imminent threat and that police protection is not good enough. In a previous fact-check, a researcher at the study center in Geneva told us that Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom have some of the strictest gun regulations. Comparing gun violence The studies we found measured gun violence in terms of the rate of firearm-related homicides. By that standard, America ranks worst among every country of comparable economic status. David Hemenway at Harvard’s School of Public Health has looked at gun deaths across nations. ""If we look at high-income countries, the weakest gun control laws are in the United States, and we have by far the most gun violence,"" Hemenway said. ""At the other extreme are the U.K. and Japan, which have the strongest gun laws, and they have among the lowest levels of gun violence."" The World Bank provides a list of high-income countries. Based on data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and reporting by the Guardian, America does top the list for the rate of murder by gun fire with a rate of 2.97 deaths per 100,000. Chile comes next, but Chile is not on the list of wealthy nations with strict gun laws. (The full list is here.) In the wealthy group with strict laws, the data undercut Bolling’s claim. Country Homicide by firearm rate per 100,000 population United States 2.97 Canada 0.51 Australia 0.14 United Kingdom 0.07 Japan 0.01 Source: UNODC, Guardian For the countries that have tougher gun laws but lower wealth than the United States, South Africa has a higher rate of gun violence, 17.03 deaths per 100,000, and Singapore has a lower rate, .02 deaths per 100,000. Our ruling Bolling said that countries with tougher gun laws have more gun violence.

130,17169,"When people enter the service, there’s not a mental health evaluation.","April 6, 2014","McCaul said ""there's not a mental health evaluation when people enter the service."" Compared to the physical medical examination potential enlistees go through, there is no separate, specific examination of a recruit’s mental health. While the armed services review past medical records for a history of mental health issues and allow for the applicant to offer any additional information, it has not prevented a sizable number of individuals with mental health problems from acceptance. Lawmakers and military officials can debate what steps should or should not be taken, but we can’t find any flaw in McCaul’s characterization of the current procedures.",Steve Contorno,"The second shooting at the Texas military base Fort Hood in less than five years has reopened wounds -- and old debates. During the Sunday morning political shows on April 6, 2014, typical questions over base security and concealed carry rules on military installations emerged in the wake of the deadly shooting last week, with politicians and pundits mostly assuming their party-line positions. But there was some bipartisan consensus that the military should take a closer look at the mental health of enlisted service members. On Fox News Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said the effort should start at sign-up. ""When people enlist in the military, there is a physical check but there's not a mental health evaluation when people enter the service,"" McCaul. ""I think this will be a good idea to, No. 1, screen out individuals that may have mental illness problems. No. 2, have a baseline so that when they return home, we can compare that to where they are when they come back."" We were unfamiliar with the process men and women go through to enlist and imagine McCaul’s claim about mental health evaluations caught the attention of viewers as well. So we decided to check it out. No formal process Officials have not yet identified a motive that caused Army Spec. Ivan A. Lopez to open fire at the Fort Hood base, killing three and injuring more than a dozen. Lopez was being treated for depression and was screened for post traumatic stress disorder, though Army officials have said mental health was ""not the direct precipitating factor"" in the shooting. McCaul’s office pointed us to legislation introduced by Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Penn. on March 27, 2014 -- coincidentally, just days before the shooting -- called the ""Medical Evaluation Parity for Service Members Act."" The bill would require a medical evaluation before an individual enlists in the armed forces. According to the legislation, ""Although the military currently has a baseline measurement process for physical health, the military does not currently have similar standards for mental health."" Speaking in favor of the bill, retired Army colonel and director of legislation for the National Guard Association of the United States Peter Duff said, ""Not having a baseline is a neglectful disservice to our military members and veterans who risk their lives for our nation."" The bill has the support from various military and veteran organizations, including Veterans of Foreign Wars, National Guard Association of the United States, Reserve Officers Association, Reserve Enlisted Association, Association of the U.S. Navy, National Military Family Association and Military Officers Association of America, as well as the American Psychological Association. A mental health examination is not listed in a description of the application procedure on the United State Military Entrance Processing Command website or in the Military Entrance Processing Station regulations. That’s all pretty strong evidence that no separate examination for identifying mental health disorders in enlistees exists, at least not in a similar form as the physical new recruits must go through. What does exist? But is there any evaluation the armed services conduct upfront? In addition to an aptitude test, as part of the initial screening, military officials review the medical records of potential service members for their mental health history. Col. Rebecca I. Porter, chief of the behavioral health division of the Office of the Army’s Surgeon General, told the Washington Post that the application process ""includes a review of whatever medical records we have available, as well as asking potential soldiers to complete questionnaires where they might disclose information. We look for past diagnoses or past treatments, or other indicators of behavioral problems."" Porter said a past suicide attempt, mood disorders like depression or bipolar disorders or drug abuse could all preclude someone from gaining admittance to one of the service branches. But much of that review requires the individual to have a documented medical history or to offer information that they may have problems. Such an admission would likely mean they would not be accepted. ""People who want to come into the Army are no fools,"" Dr. Elspeth Ritchie, a former chief psychiatrist in the Army, told the Los Angeles Times. ""They know if you say you had a past suicide attempt, you're probably not going to get in."" A recent study from the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry conducted in consultation with the U.S. Army found 1 in 5 servicemembers had a mental health disorder before they even enlisted. Once enlisted, however, service members are prone to frequent mental health evaluations before and after deployment. ""We have a series of evaluation of any soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, Coast Guardsman who's deployed prior to their deployment,"" Retired Lieutenant General Eric Schoomaker told NPR. ""They have access to mental health and physical health care providers, as well, while they're on deployment. And when they return from deployment, within 30 days of their being redeployed, they have another series of examinations with the help of their small unit leader down-range, which is then married up with further assessments that take place when they hit the ground back at home station."" Mental health evaluations can also be recommended by the overseeing officer. ""If the chain of command becomes aware of a change in the soldier’s behavior, he can ask the soldier to be seen at a behavioral health clinic,"" Porter said in her Post interview. ""Or if a commander had questions about a soldier’s fitness for duty, they could do a command-directed mental health evaluation, in which case a soldier is referred for evaluation with the understanding that the behavioral health provider will provide feedback to the commander."" Not everyone in the military community agrees that a mental health evaluation upfront would be helpful. Schoomaker, a surgeon in the Army until 2012, recently told the Los Angeles Times that such a process ""would just lead to driving the problems further underground."" Our ruling McCaul said ""there's not a mental health evaluation when people enter the service."" Compared to the physical medical examination potential enlistees go through, there is no separate, specific examination of a recruit’s mental health. While the armed services review past medical records for a history of mental health issues and allow for the applicant to offer any additional information, it has not prevented a sizable number of individuals with mental health problems from acceptance.

131,14388,"Under Hillary Clinton, State Department ""officials were sending official thank-yous to people who gave to the Clinton Foundation.","March 28, 2016","Norquist said that State Department officials were sending official thank-yous to donors to the Clinton Foundation.

However, there is no hint that any staff member expressed official appreciation to any donor. There is no indication that money for those projects flowed through CGI. Finally, Clinton thanked governments for showing up, but didn’t thank donors. She praised the audience in general, but that would include many who were on the receiving end of CGI’s efforts. The documents do not say what Norquist suggested they said.",Jon Greenberg,"Opinion polls consistently show that if there’s one thing Hillary Clinton is up against with voters, it’s that too many of them question her honesty. Anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, fed into that theme during an interview on Fox Business with host Maria Bartiromo on March 24, 2016. Norquist segued from talking about her presidential campaign fundraising to the ""mixing of her official job as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation."" Norquist said, ""We now know (that) officials were sending official thank-yous to people who gave to the Clinton Foundation. Letting them know ‘wink, wink, nudge, nudge’ that you didn’t just give to the Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, appreciates what you’ve done."" We wondered if Norquist's allegation was correct. When President-elect Barack Obama considered making Hillary Clinton his secretary of state, the immediate concern was that foreign interests might curry favor at the State Department by supporting her husband’s efforts at the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative, also called CGI. To clear the way for Clinton’s nomination, those organizations agreed to a number of measures to avoid real and apparent conflicts. Among the changes, the foundation would publish the names of its donors and separate itself from the Clinton Global Initiative. Bill Clinton would not raise funds for CGI, and CGI itself would no longer accept donations from foreign governments or hold events outside the United States. After all that, did Clinton's State Department really cross the line by sending officials thanks to the foundation's donors? We asked Norquist’s spokesman John Kartch for the source behind the statement that State Department officials were sending thank-yous to people who gave to the Clinton Foundation. Kartch sent us a link to a page on the website of Judicial Watch, which describes itself as a conservative educational group. Judicial Watch posted a number of documents it received through a Freedom of Information Act request to the State Department. The first few pages in the collection were an exchange of emails between Clinton’s chief of staff Cheryl Mills and other top aides at the State Department, and Amitabh Desai, director of foreign policy at the Clinton Foundation. (Before joining the foundation, Desai was a legislative aide to then-Sen. Hillary Clinton.) Desai wanted Secretary Clinton to speak at the closing session of the Clinton Global Initiative meeting on Sept. 25, 2009. The conversation begins on Aug. 22, 2009, with this letter from Desai to Mills and Huma Abedin, Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, at the State Department:  To decode the lingo of CGI, ""HRC"" is Hillary Rodham Clinton, ""WJC"" is William Jefferson Clinton and ""commitments"" are agreements among aid groups, governments and often corporations to work on a particular project. Desai’s list of three commitments included: Launching a media campaign to reduce sexual violence against girls. It involved the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, several United Nations agencies, a large Brazilian ad agency and a foundation set up by a former hedge fund owner. Promoting the use of vitamin and mineral fortified food among poorer Indian households. It involved a major Indian food corporation. Expanding a micro-insurance fund. It involved an investment fund that had raised $44 million to provide small insurance policies in poor communities. Mills at the State Department answered, ""I think this if fine but here's my question - how does this work - are these announced before or after she speaks and what relationship are they supposed to bear to what she says?"" Desai said commitments are announced throughout the conference. ""We could give you a list of all announcements as they get scheduled as we get closer to the meeting, and anything else that would be helpful."" Mills replied, ""It would be helpful to have list of commitments during whole session so she can reference more than those just around her speech."" The final words in this email chain come from Caitlin Klevorick, a former consultant to the foundation who became a special assistant in the Secretary of State’s office. ""One question is if we want to see if there is a decent mass of fs (food security) related commitments to announce together at closing as a ‘mega’ commitment,"" Klevorick wrote. That is the sum total of the interactions between State Department and Clinton Foundation staff, according to the emails obtained by Judicial Watch. We asked Kartch at Americans for Tax Reform if we had missed anything and did not hear back. Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said he sees clear collaboration between the two entities. ""State Department and Clinton Foundation staff worked together on how Mrs. Clinton could thank Foundation supporters for their commitments during a speech, which Mrs. Clinton did,"" Fitton said. ""Mrs. Clinton, as the result of work by her aides and a Clinton Foundation representative, provided an official thank you during her speech."" This is different from Norquist’s claim. Norquist said State Department officials were sending official thank-yous. The emails don’t describe that. Further, in her actual speech, Clinton didn’t thank anyone for contributing money. Early on, she did express her appreciation, but that was aimed at governments, not donors. ""As secretary of state, I really, in terms of protocol, should be acknowledging all of the heads of state and heads of government who are here, but there are far too many,"" Clinton said. ""So let me just express my deep appreciation for your involvement and for your presence here. We look forward to working with you and your governments as we move forward on the new agenda of the Obama administration."" A moment later, she praises the entire audience. ""This is an exceptional gathering of people, who have made exceptional commitments to bettering our world. We see it in everything you do. It seems a good opportunity, given the talent, the energy and the passion in this room, to talk about an exceptional global challenge, chronic hunger and what we all can do about it."" Clinton spent the bulk of her speech talking about the White House policy to combat hunger. At the end, she told the audience, ""We need your ideas and your feedback, and we need your active support in any and every capacity."" Kathleen Clark, who specializes in public sector ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis, told told us she didn’t see any smoking gun in the emails Norquist offered as evidence. Our ruling Norquist said that State Department officials were sending official thank-yous to donors to the Clinton Foundation.

132,12627,"Every day, four North Carolinians die from a medication or drug overdose.","April 13, 2017","Rep. Greg Murphy has been promoting his STOP Act, which would limit access to prescription painkillers, by saying that drug overdoses kill four people a day in North Carolina. That’s basically accurate (it’s 3.5 per day) but prescription pills alone are only responsible for 2 deaths a day – half of what Murphy said. However, there’s wide agreement in the scientific community that for such counts it makes sense to lump heroin and painkillers together (which cause 2.7 deaths a day) and some research has argued for including cocaine deaths, too. Even if his statistics are slightly inflated, Murphy’s general point – that opioid addiction is leading to multiple deaths per day in North Carolina – is correct.",Will Doran,"The fight to limit the availability of prescription painkillers in North Carolina is being led in part by the only medical doctor in the N.C. General Assembly. Rep. Greg Murphy, a Republican from Greenville who is also a urology surgeon, is the primary sponsor of what’s being called the STOP Act. That stands for ""Strengthen Opioid Misuse Prevention."" In the past several weeks, he has promoted his bill with a sobering statistic. ""Every day, four North Carolinians die from a medication or drug overdose,"" Murphy said in early March, when he first introduced the bill. ""I prescribe these medications daily and I see the problem first hand."" Murphy has often been quoted or paraphrased in the news repeating some version of that claim about the deadliness of drug overdoses, most recently on Monday when the bill passed the House of Representatives unanimously. It’s a popular argument for a popular bill, which has support from lawmakers of both parties as well as a vocal ally in Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein. In addition to other provisions, the bill would reduce the amount of pain pills a doctor could prescribe to most patients on their initial visits. The idea is that fewer pills will lead to fewer opportunities for abuse or addiction. The STOP Act passed the N.C. House 114-0 and is now in the Senate. But we wondered whether the morbid statistic that’s driving much of the conversation is actually correct. How deadly are prescription pills? In 2015, according to the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, 1,370 people died of unintentional poisonings. Of those deaths, 93 percent (1,274) were drug overdoses – everything from painkillers to cocaine to heroin. That’s an average of 3.5 deaths daily, which is in line with Murphy’s claim of four a day. Nearly the same number of people died in 2015 from unintentional drug overdoses as died from gunshots. If you also include intentional overdoses, then drugs were deadlier than both guns and car crashes. A 2016 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study found the counties with the highest rates of drug overdose deaths are all in western or southeastern North Carolina. But even though Murphy phrased his claim broadly about all drug overdoses, his bill doesn’t target street drugs like cocaine and heroin. The STOP Act is only aimed at limiting the supply of prescription painkillers. Prescription pills were involved in 738 unintentional overdose deaths in 2015. That’s two a day – certainly troubling, but only about half of Murphy’s claim. However, experts agree there’s a strong link between painkillers and heroin, since they give the same type of high, and heroin tends to be cheaper and more widely available to addicts. ""When we talk to people who are injecting heroin, they all got there through prescription opioids,"" said Steve Marshall, an epidemiologist and director of UNC-Chapel Hill’s Injury Prevention Research Center. ""It's not some of them. It's all of them."" Marshall said it would be fair for Murphy to count heroin overdose deaths when promoting the STOP Act, if not cocaine overdose deaths. Cocaine, unlike heroin and painkillers, is not an opioid. Just under 1,000 North Carolinians died from an unintentional opioid overdose in 2015 (see here for county-level data). That’s an average of 2.7 per day – again, not exactly what Murphy said, but not far off. Last year California medical company Castlight Health ranked four North Carolina cities among the top 25 nationwide for painkiller abuse. Wilmington, the company’s study said, had the country’s highest rate of opioid abuse. The report found more than half of the prescriptions issued for painkillers in Wilmington are being abused. Kay Sanford, another UNC-Chapel Hill epidemiologist, is credited with discovering the rising trend of prescription pill addiction and overdoses in North Carolina in the early 2000s. She said many people have been replacing painkillers with heroin in the last few years. ""The number of people dying from prescription opioids, in North Carolina and nationwide, has gone down while the number of people dying from heroin has gone up,"" Sanford said. ""So when you combine those two, it's basically the same number."" Yet in Murphy’s favor, at least one piece of brand-new research has made the argument that cocaine should be included in these counts, too. In February researchers with several federal government agencies published a paper that argued cocaine overdoses can be linked back to the increased use of opioids like painkillers. ""Opioids, primarily heroin and synthetic opioids, have been driving the recent increase in cocaine-related overdose deaths,"" the study concluded. Our ruling Rep. Greg Murphy has been promoting his STOP Act, which would limit access to prescription painkillers, by saying that drug overdoses kill four people a day in North Carolina. That’s basically accurate (it’s 3.5 per day) but prescription pills alone are only responsible for 2 deaths a day – half of what Murphy said.

U.S. investigators and health officials have said there may be more than one cause for the cases of vaping lung illness. They have also pointed to vaping oils containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, as being especially risky. In Britain, which currently has 3.6 million regular e-cigarette users, such oils are banned and advertising of vapes is much more tightly regulated than in the United States, said Ann McNeill, a professor of tobacco addiction at the Institute of Psychiatry Psychology & Neuroscience at King’s College London. She and Britton also noted that rates of tobacco cigarette smoking - which can cause lung cancer and heart disease and is known to kill about half of all those who do it - are dropping more rapidly in Britain than in the United States. This is partly due to tobacco smokers switching to nicotine-containing e-cigarettes to help them quit, they said. “It would be a great shame if people were deterred from using e-cigarettes because of what’s happening in the U.S.,” McNeill told reporters. India, which has the world’s second-largest population of adult smokers, last month announced a ban on the sale of e-cigarettes, citing concerns about the U.S. cases. And in Malaysia, which has banned the sale of vape liquids containing nicotine since 2015, the health minister says he is now considering a total e-cigarette sales ban. Asked whether he thought such bans made sense from a public health policy standpoint, Britton said he disagreed with India’s decision and similar ones in the United States, because they send a message to tobacco smokers to continue smoking. “It’s a no-brainer - if you stay on cigarettes you will lose a day of life for every four days that you smoke,” he said. “A flat-out ban (on e-cigarettes) will kill people.”",true,Health News

Millions of men and women watching this public service report are affected, and the odds that your belly is infected are incredibly high. Put your hand on your belly right now, right below your chest. Do you feel any excess fat in this area? Is there fat peaking out from beneath your hand? Does your belly spill below your waistline? Do you have problems with indigestion? Have you taken antibiotics in the last five years? Do you regularly eat any sugary foods such as fruit or honey? If you said “yes” to any of the above, your belly is most likely swarming with what some doctors are calling “the Vampire Fungus.” This fungus grows and grows over time and often masquerades as fat because it can swell in your stomach to the size of a basketball. The warning signs described in the video — weight gain, skin problems, indigestion, use of antibiotics in the last five years — apply to virtually every adult in America. The narrator does not specify what Vampire Fungus is, where it comes from, or how the video can help viewers overcome it. The video does, however, cite a study carried out by researchers at Rice University that allegedly concluded that the Vampire Fungus affected up to 70% of Americans. An actual Rice University  study that was published in 2004 found that up to 70% of Americans had colonies of a yeast-like parasitic fungus called Candida living in their intestines: Candida is common in humans. It’s estimated that 70 percent of people have Candida colonies in their intestines, mouths or on their skin. In most cases, the organism is commensal, meaning it does not harm people, even though it depends upon them for food. However, colonies of Candida sometimes grow too large, as happens in the case of yeast infections. While not life-threatening, vaginal yeast infections are a common and painful problem for a significant percentage of American women. The oral form of Candida infection, known as thrush, is a common problem for infants. The researchers at Rice University did not refer to Candida as a “Vampire Fungus,” nor did they describe its effects on the human body in the same way as the eRumor does. Research dating back to the 1990s indicates that probiotic bacteria — live microorganisms and yeasts — may be an effective way to counter parasitic bacteria like Candida in the intestines. A 1997  study by the National Institutes of Health found: Four species of probiotic bacteria were assessed for their capacities to protect athymic bg/bg-nu/nu and euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice from mucosal and systemic candidiasis. Each bacterial species and Candida albicans colonized the gastrointestinal tracts of both strains of mice. The presence of probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus casei GG, or Bifidobacterium animalis) in the gastrointestinal tracts prolonged the survival of adult and neonatal bg/bg-nu/nu mice compared to that of isogenic mice colonized with C. albicans alone. The incidence of systemic candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice was significantly reduced by each of the four probiotic bacterial species. Leaf Origin, the company listed as the producer of the Vampire Fungus video, happens to sell a daily  probiotic supplement that claims to promote digestive immune system health. The supplement cost $157 for a 180-day supply. It would appear that the term “Candida” was changed to “Vampire Fungus” in the video  to scare up sales.

Britain has placed an order for thousands of the devices to be made by a consortium of companies including Ford (F.N), Airbus (AIR.PA) and Rolls-Royce (RR.L). The repurposing of industry echoes Britain’s Second World War effort, with housing minister Robert Jenrick saying that all parts of the country are now on an “emergency footing” as strategic coordination centers are established. “This is an unprecedented step in peacetime,” he said.",true,Health News
144,28029,"A video shows a chicken being hypnotized by holding its head down and ""drawing"" a line in the sand extending from its beak. ","July 26, 2019","While Hemingway may be taking some artistic license with his “an hour or more” sentence, and although this trick isn’t guaranteed to work on all breeds of chicken, the above-displayed viral video showcases a technique to “hypnotize” chickens that has been used for centuries.",Dan Evon,"In July 2019, a video supposedly showing a chicken being hypnotized went viral on social media: Hypnotizing a chicken pic.twitter.com/vfdzGfjWsc — Because I’m a Guy (@CauseWereGuys) July 22, 2019  This is a genuine, unaltered video of a chicken reacting to a line being drawn in the sand directly in front of it. However, while this practice is often described as “hypnosis,” Dimitrios Beredimas, an agronomist and blogger at Strange Animals, noted that it would be more accurate to say that this chicken is in a state of “tonic immobility.” This video appears to have originated on the Insane Monkey YouTube page in April 2019. That version was accompanied by the following description:  This video shows you how it really works by drawing a single line in front of a chicken or a rooster and they become hypnotized almost instantly and will not move until the line is gone. This really works and i have done it many times and so have all my neighbors and family who have chickens and roosters. While many people may be seeing this chicken hypnotism video for the first time, this behavior has been acknowledged since at least 1648, when it was mentioned in “Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae” (“The Great Art of Light and Shadow”) by Athanasius Kircher, a German Jesuit scholar:  So what’s happening here? The video shows a chicken entering a catatonic-type state after experiencing a “fear-potentiated response” to a line drawn in the sand. This animal behavior is called “‘tonic immobility,” but readers may be more familiar with the colloquial terms “playing dead” or “playing possum.”  While this is typically a defensive mechanism, Beredimas notes that the chicken isn’t particularly good at pretending to be dead: This strange animal behaviour is officially called ‘tonic immobility’, a natural state of semi-paralysis that many animals exhibit when under threat. Commonly known as apparent death, playing dead and playing possum, this state serves as a defensive mechanism as most predators prefer live prey. In chickens, this is most probably a vestigial trait as it doesn’t seem to have a useful purpose. The chicken doesn’t make a good job hiding the fact it’s still alive. Its obvious that is breathing and we can see some eye movement and blinking. Since this phenomenon may be new to city folk, let’s take a look at a few other videos showcasing this technique:    If you have access to a chicken and want to try this, the Strange Animals blog provided the following instructions: The trick is quite simple. All you have to do is hold the chicken’s head down against the ground, and draw a straight line using a stick, your finger, a piece of chalk or whatever. The line should start at the beak and extend straight outwards, in front of the chicken. If done properly, the chicken — or rooster — will be put into a state of trance and lie still for anywhere from 30 seconds to 30 minutes! To de-hypnotize the chicken, just clap your hands or give it a gentle push. It may take a few tries to awaken the bird. This isn’t the only way to hypnotize a chicken. Other methods include swirling your finger in a circle around the birds head or tucking its head underneath its wing. The latter method was briefly mentioned in Ernest Hemingway’s posthumous 1985 book, “The Dangerous Summer“: You can lay the chicken down with its head still under its wing and it will lie, hypnotized, for an hour or more or until you wake it. It was a parlor trick that had much success in East Africa. Sometimes I would have a dozen chickens lying asleep in a row on the porch of some native hut in a village under Kilimanjaro when we needed something badly and it was necessary to make magic to obtain it.",true,Fauxtography
145,24360,The attorney general requires that rape victims pay for the rape kit.,"January 12, 2010",Radnofsky says the attorney general requires rape victims pay for rape kits.,Meghan Ashford-Grooms,"In her campaign to become the next attorney general of Texas, Democratic candidate Barbara Ann Radnofsky is using a crime-victim issue to attack her opponent, GOP incumbent Greg Abbott. In a video on her Web site, Radnofsky makes the provocative claim that ""the attorney general requires that rape victims pay for the rape kit"" — a reference to forensic examinations given to victims of sexual assault. We wondered whether Radnofsky's statement was true. This is what we found:  Under current state law, sexual assault victims in Texas should never have to pay for their forensic exams, which are done by medical professionals to collect physical evidence for the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault suspects. Local law enforcement agencies are responsible for paying hospitals for rape kits in cases in which the victims report the crimes. Those agencies can seek reimbursement of up to $700 through the Crime Victims’ Compensation Fund, which is administered by the attorney general’s office. If a victim chooses not to report the crime, the Texas Department of Public Safety is responsible for paying for the exam and getting reimbursement from the fund. When asked about Radnofsky’s statement in the video, Torie Camp, deputy director of the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, a victims advocacy organization, said, ""That’s not true, and if any rape victims are paying for rape kits, that shouldn’t happen. State law is very clear on this issue, and the attorney general can’t trump state law to make rape victims pay for rape kits."" But Texas law hasn't always read that way. In the past, rape exams were done by medical professionals and then paid for by law enforcement agencies only if sexual assault victims reported the crimes. The reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, signed by President George W. Bush in 2006, gave states three years to eliminate such reporting requirements so that all victims could obtain free forensic medical exams. In 2009, the Texas Legislature finally changed the law, directing the Department of Public Safety to cover the cost of a rape kit for any victim who chooses not to report. For Radnofsky, that change took too long. She says that Abbott could have -- and should have -- acted earlier to bring administration of the victims' compensation fund into compliance with the federal act. A spokesman for Abbott's office says the attorney general did not have the authority to change a policy that was mandated by state law. When asked if she knew of any instances when victims had paid for their own rape kits, Radnofsky said she did not. But she isn't the first person to wade into this gnarly issue. In May, a Houston television station aired a report, picked up by CNN, that caused an uproar in the advocacy community because it implied that sexual assault victims were being billed for forensic exams, Camp said. In response, both the attorney general’s office and TAASA issued public statements that termed the TV story inaccurate and misleading. The attorney general's office said that as of Jan. 1, the office had paid for 57,702 rape exams since December 2002 and had not denied any requests for reimbursements for the kits from law enforcement agencies. TAASA said the TV report implied that billing victims for their rape kits ""was a common practice in Texas despite being told by several sources … that this was not the case. … The problem is there isn’t really a problem."" Officials from other organizations that deal directly with sexual assault victims, including SafePlace and the Austin Police Department’s sex crimes unit, also said that they were not aware of any large-scale problems with victims receiving bills for forensic exams. That leaves this question: Before the Texas law was changed, did sexual assault victims who did not want to report a crime have to pay for their forensic exams? No, according to officials contacted for this story. In those cases, victims were not given the exams to begin with, so payment was not an issue. However, hospitals have sometimes mistakenly sent bills to victims for their forensic exams, according to the attorney general’s office. But none of the officials we contacted knew of any data on how often that happens. Summing up: Regardless of whether Abbott took the initiative on this issue and regardless of whether some sexual assault victims have been mistakenly billed on occasion, Radnofsky’s claim is wrong. The attorney general does not require rape victims to pay for rape kits and never has. That's why we give Radnofsky a .",false,"Crime, Women, Texas, Barbara Ann Radnofsky, "

147,8049,"Anxiety, anger and hope as women face childbirth during coronavirus pandemic.","March 27, 2020","To prepare for the birth of her first child, Veronika Legat, a 35-year-old Czech lawyer, has cut off contact with her family and friends to avoid getting ill from the coronavirus or even catching a mild cold.","Michael Kahn, Claudia Cristoferi","Her hospital told her that if she had any symptoms of a cold, a fever or runny nose, her newborn baby, due in April, may be isolated from her for two weeks as a precaution against the new disease. She might not be allowed to breastfeed. “I’m not afraid of the virus but I feel angry,” Legat said from her home in Prague. “Until the birth, we are staying home, and won’t meet with anyone.”  As the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across Europe, prompting restrictions on public life and putting unprecedented strain on hospitals, pregnant women like Legat are preparing to give birth with a mixture of anxiety, anger and hope. Some are worried about being separated from their babies. Others regret not being able to have a partner present at the birth. Many are having to accept reduced pre-natal medical appointments. Healthcare authorities have introduced varying rules in different countries, deciding whether a woman can be accompanied during childbirth, for example, of if she must be separated from her baby if she is sick. In some cases these rules are more stringent than recommendations issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), reflecting global uncertainty about how the virus acts and how best to prevent it spreading. The WHO says there is no evidence that pregnant women are at higher risk of severe illness than the general population if they contract the COVID-19 disease, caused by the new coronavirus. It recommends that women who have tested positive for the virus should be encouraged to care for and breastfeed their newborns as normal, provided they maintain stringent hygiene. Marika Antolec-Walczak, 34, a judge from Tychy in southern Poland, knew if she went into labour early she would not have been able to travel to her nearby hospital, converted into an infectious disease unit because of the pandemic. But what she was most afraid of was being alone. “The first two times I gave birth, my husband was indispensable in helping me cope with the pain,” she said. Most hospitals in Poland do not allow women to be accompanied during childbirth, even though the WHO recommends “having a companion of choice present during delivery”. “It’s a threat not only to the patient and the child but also to medical personnel,” said Michal Bulsa, an obstetrician in Szczecin, a city in northwestern Poland. “I wouldn’t allow it.”  For women elsewhere in Europe, having a partner share the experience of childbirth is an option. In Italy, which has been the hardest hit by the disease in Europe, some hospitals allow women to be accompanied during the birth, but not afterwards. The challenges of giving birth during the coronavirus crisis do not end there. Some women have been told not to arrive at the hospital too early - a tough call to make, especially for first-time mothers - to minimise the chance of infecting others or being infected. Shopping for a newborn is also tough, with most stores closed in many parts of Europe. Borrowing a crib from a friend in another town may no longer be possible with travel restricted across much of the continent. Valentina Draghi, a 41-year-old speech therapist from Milan, started her maternity leave in February, weeks before her April 7 due date. She had hoped to go shopping for clothes with her baby girl’s grandmothers and attend prenatal classes. “All of a sudden nothing of what I had planned is left,” she said. She was told she would have to go through labour wearing a protective mask. “My partner may be present, but in two weeks I do not know what will happen,” she said. “My biggest fear is that they won’t let him in. I know it’s forbidden elsewhere.”  “It’s my first pregnancy. I’m 41 years old. I’d like it to be a unique and important event,” she said. For Louise Koldsgaard, trusting the healthcare system in Denmark gives her a sense of calm. “My midwife told me: maternity wards have never been cleaner,” she said. “I try not to let it get to me too much. I still walk my dog every day and drink coffee at the local shop.”  But Brandon Allen, 48, from Detroit in the United States, fears what awaits his family beyond the birth of his fourth child due next week. “It’s surreal. I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” he said. “People around me I know are dying. “I’m freaking out about that. We are bringing a baby into this pandemic,” he said.",true,Health News
148,2881,GSK hands back failed muscular dystrophy drug to Prosensa.,"January 13, 2014",GlaxoSmithKline has handed back rights to an experimental drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy to U.S.-listed Dutch biotech firm Prosensa after it failed last year in a critical clinical trial.,Ben Hirschler,"Both companies said on Monday that Prosensa would now have full and unencumbered rights to drisapersen, as well as other compounds at an earlier stage of development. The move marks the termination of a 2009 collaboration deal between the two firms. Hopes for the drug slumped last September when it did not show a statistically significant improvement in the distance that patients could walk in six minutes compared with a placebo in a final-stage Phase III test run by GSK. [ID:nL5N0HG1JP]  Currently, there is no approved drug to alter the course of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) - a rare muscle-wasting genetic disease affecting boys that puts most of them in wheelchairs by the age of 12 and leads to early death. Shares in Prosensa, which raised nearly $90 million in an initial public offering on Nasdaq in June, fell 17.5 percent to $4.63 on the news GSK had thrown in the towel. They were priced at $13 in the IPO and hit a high of $34.55 in August. Despite the latest setback, Prosensa’s chief executive Hans Schikan said he had not given up on drisapersen, adding the company was analyzing results from various studies of the drug. “Based on the data we’ve seen so far we feel it absolutely justifies a discussion with experts, with patient advocacy groups and most importantly with regulators to define what the next steps could be, including a potential regulatory path forward,” he said in a telephone interview from the J.P. Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco. Schikan will present an update on the company’s prospects at the meeting on Thursday, including a high-level update on various analyses that have been carried out so far. He declined to specify the likely next step, but industry analysts at Leerink said the fact GSK had handed back rights suggested that pooling and sub-group analyses had failed to provide strong enough evidence to justify a filing for approval. There had been speculation that younger DMD patients might benefit more from the drug or that combining results from different clinical trials might show a statistically significant drisapersen effect. Leerink estimated that Prosensa ended 2013 with around $98 million in cash, which depending on its new development plans for drisapersen would likely be enough to fund operations into mid- or late-2015. Last summer GSK and Prosensa had been seen as ahead of the pack in making a drug for DMD - a belief underscored by it having been awarded a “breakthrough therapy” designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In the event, the key trial results in September dashed those hopes, dealing a major blow to Prosensa but causing relatively little damage at its much larger partner GSK. Overall GSK’s research laboratories have done well in the past 12 months, with new drug approvals in HIV, cancer and respiratory disease. But Britain’s biggest drugmaker has been less successful in higher risk areas. In addition to the DMD setback it has also reported disappointing results with a new kind of therapeutic cancer vaccine and a novel heart medicine.",true,Health News

The only connection was a private train running every half hour half way to Tokyo.”  The man, who said he arrived just before 4 p.m. local time and only caught a bus at 7:30 p.m. after standing in line, added: “My wife said: what if this happens during the Olympics?”   Typhoon Faxai, a Lao woman’s name, slammed ashore near the city of Chiba shortly before dawn, bringing with it wind gusts of 207 kmh (128 mph), the strongest ever recorded in Chiba, national broadcaster NHK said. A woman in her fifties was confirmed dead after she was found in a Tokyo street and taken to hospital. Footage from a nearby security camera showed she had been smashed against a building by strong winds, NHK reported. Another woman in her 20s was rescued from her house in Ichihara, east of Tokyo, after it was partly crushed when a metal pole from a golf driving range fell on it. She was seriously injured. “There was a huge grinding noise, I couldn’t figure out what it was. Then I looked up and saw a big hole in the roof, but I was so keyed up I couldn’t figure out what had happened,” a neighbor said. Some minor landslides occurred and a bridge was washed away, while as many as 930,000 houses lost power at one point, NHK said, including the entire city of Kamogawa. But the number of homes without power had dropped to 840,000 by early Monday afternoon, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. Some concrete electric poles were snapped off at their bases, while electricity towers in Chiba were toppled over. Some panels of a floating solar power plant southeast of Tokyo were on fire. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency said a cooling tower at its research reactor at Oarai, which has not been in operation since 2006 and is set to be decommissioned, had fallen, but there was no radiation leakage, impact on workers or the surrounding environment. A Sony Corp (6758.T) spokesman said operations at its plant in Kisarazu, southeast of Tokyo, were suspended due to power outages. The company could not say when the plant, which assembles PlayStation gaming consoles, would reopen. Two Nissan factories west of Tokyo, including its Oppama plant, suspended operations due to flooding, NHK said. About four to five typhoons make landfall in Japan every year, but it is unusual for them to do so near Tokyo. NHK said Faxai was the strongest storm in the Tokyo area in several years. Streets normally busy with commuters walking or bicycling were deserted, with winds just east of Tokyo shaking buildings. Metal signs were torn from buildings, trucks overturned, the metal roof of a petrol station torn off and glass display cases destroyed, scattering sidewalks with broken glass. Trees were uprooted throughout the metropolitan area, some falling on train tracks to further snarl transport. Some 2,000 people were ordered to leave their homes at one point because of the danger of landslides, NHK said. Parts of the high-speed Tokaido Shinkansen train line were halted but service resumed after several hours.

Mitch McConnell enlisted the help of his wife, former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, to push back against claims from Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes that the Kentucky Republican is anti-women. ""Have you ever noticed how some liberals feel entitled to speak on behalf of all women? As if every woman agrees with Barack Obama,"" Chao says in an ad released Aug. 5, 2014. A narrator adds: ""Mitch McConnell co-sponsored the original Violence Against Women Act – he’s always supported its purpose. Mitch voted for even stronger protections than Obama’s agenda will allow."" We took a look at Grimes’ ad in a separate fact-check. We said the claim that McConnell voted ""two times against the Violence against Women Act"" was Half True, given McConnell’s history of voting in favor of the law at times. But what about McConnell’s response that he ""voted for even stronger protections"" than the Violence Against Women Act that President Barack Obama signed? The Violence Against Women Act first passed Congress in 1994 and, according to the Congressional Research Service, was ""intended to change attitudes toward domestic violence, foster awareness of domestic violence, improve services and provisions for victims, and revise the manner in which the criminal justice system responds to domestic violence."" The bill was reauthorized and expanded several times in the succeeding two decades, most recently in 2013. While the Violence Against Women Act sailed to reauthorization in 2000 and 2005, attempts to do so in 2012 and 2013 were marred by partisan fighting in Congress. Democrats presented a bill with three new components that many Republicans rejected: including victims of discrimination for sexual orientation and gender identity among ""underserved populations""; increasing the cap on U-Visas, a visa that grants nonimmigrant status to immigrant victims of domestic violence who assist police in prosecuting their attackers; allowing non-American Indian residents on tribal land to be prosecuted by tribal courts for domestic violence. The 2012 Senate bill died in the House, but the 2013 version passed Congress and was signed by Obama. Both years, Republicans offered their own versions of the Violence Against Women Act. Those measures, McConnell’s campaign said, included provisions that made them ""stronger"" than the bill Obama signed into law. What were those provisions? For starters, Republicans proposed mandatory minimum sentences — ranging from 5 to 15 years — on certain sexual assault crimes. However, advocates of domestic violence awareness were specifically against the inclusion of these provisions. The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women, an umbrella group for many stakeholders advocating on this issue, worried that long mandatory minimums would ""keep victims who were assaulted by someone they know from reporting"" and would create other issues in sentencing. ""These proposals are solutions in search of problems, and will only serve to exacerbate the already existing problem of prison overcrowding,"" the organization wrote. McConnell’s campaign also noted that the Republican amendments required that 30 percent of the grant money given to states and localities to train and assist law enforcement in combating violence against women must be set aside for sexual assault. The Democratic bill put the figure at 20 percent. But this was more a shift in priorities than anything. It wasn’t allocating extra money to combat violence against women, just mandating how much of the pot must be spent on a specific type of violence. Advocates of the Democratic bill said the Republican bill was weaker because it did not include the additional protections for LGBT, immigrants and American Indian women who are abused on tribal land by non-natives. While there were may have been considerable political differences on whether those provisions should be part of the Violence Against Women Act, it’s hard to claim that bills that didn’t include them — the ones McConnell supported — had ""stronger protections."" Our ruling McConnell’s ad claimed that he ""voted for even stronger protections than Obama’s agenda will allow."" Perhaps McConnell could argue that the mandatory minimum sentences Republicans required in their alternative made for a ""stronger"" bill, but advocates of domestic abuse awareness opposed this measure as unnecessary. And the Republican measure was absent several protections for certain groups that were included in the bill Obama signed.

Snopes spoke with Victoria Price, who confirmed in an email that this claim is true. The broadcast journalist also shared her story in a Twitter post on July 23, 2020, that read: As a journalist, it’s been full throttle since the pandemic began. Never-ending shifts in a never-ending news cycle. Adjusting to remote workflows and in my case, taking on a new investigative role. We were covering the most important health story in a century, but my own health was the farthest thing from my mind. Until a viewer emailed me last month. She saw a lump on my neck. Said it reminded her of her own. Hers was cancer. Turns out, mine is too. Price went on to say that COVID-19 responses created some “diagnostic delays,” but that she will have undergone surgery by mid-July 2020 to remove the tumor, thyroid, and a couple of nearby lymph nodes. Price’s doctor told her that the cancer is spreading, but “not too much,” and they are both hopeful that this will be the journalist’s “first and last procedure.” “Had I never received that email, I never would have called my doctor. The cancer would have continued to spread. It’s a scary and humbling thought,” wrote Price.

157,2584,Ireland to clarify abortion rules after woman's death.,"November 15, 2012",Ireland’s government pledged on Thursday to clarify its abortion laws after an Indian woman who was refused a termination died from blood poisoning in an Irish hospital.,"Conor Humphries, Lorraine Turner","Thousands took to the streets to protest on Wednesday after news broke of the death of Savita Halappanavar of septicemia following a miscarriage 17 weeks into her pregnancy. Activists in the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country, which has some of the world’s most restrictive laws on abortion, say the refusal by doctors to terminate the pregnancy earlier may have contributed to her death. “I was deeply disturbed yesterday by what Savita’s husband said. I don’t think as a country we should allow a situation where women’s rights are put at risk in this way,” Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore told parliament on Thursday. “There is no question of equivocation. We need to bring legal clarity to this issue and that is what we are going to do.”  Irish law does not specify under what circumstances the threat to the life or health of the mother is high enough to justify a termination, leaving doctors to decide. Critics say this means doctors’ personal beliefs can play a role. Halappanavar was admitted to hospital in severe pain on October 21 and asked for a termination after doctors told her the baby would not survive, according to her husband Praveen. The foetus was surgically removed when its heartbeat stopped days later, but her family believes the delay contributed to the blood poisoning that killed Halappanavar on October 28. Praveen said he would wait for the results of an investigation before deciding whether to sue, but that Ireland’s Roman Catholic tradition appeared to have been a factor in the decision to deny a termination. “I am still in shock. It is hard to believe that religion can mean somebody’s life,” Praveen Halappanavar told Reuters. He said he planned to return to Ireland from India, where he traveled with his wife’s body. The Irish health authority (HSE) has launched an inquiry which the health minister said must “stand up to the scrutiny of the world.” Irish media said Praveen would be interviewed. The Indian couple were resident and working in Ireland, he as an engineer and she as a dentist. Despite a dramatic waning of the influence of the Catholic Church, which dominated politics in Ireland until the 1980s, successive governments have been loath to legislate on an issue they fear could alienate conservative voters. Fine Gael, the senior partner in Ireland’s ruling coalition, told supporters before a recent election that it would not introduce new laws allowing abortion during its five-year term, despite pressure from its junior partner Labour to act. The government said it had received long-delayed recommendations from an expert panel on introducing new rules on abortion, and would report before the end of the month. Four out of five Irish voters support a change in the law to permit abortion in cases where a mother’s life is at risk, according to a recent opinion poll. But a vocal anti-abortion minority has dominated the debate on abortion in Ireland in the past, with campaigners arguing that the adoption of legislation or guidelines for medical terminations would bring in abortion through the back door. In 1992, when challenged in the “X-case” involving a 14-year-old rape victim, the Supreme Court ruled that abortion was permitted when the woman’s life was at risk, including from suicide. A European Court of Human Rights in 2010 ruled that Ireland must clarify what this means in practice. “This is exactly what the (European) court was complaining about ... The court has not said Ireland must or must not have abortion, they said they have to clarify circumstances,” said Ronan McCrea, a barrister and lecturer in law at University College London. “The vagueness ... gives excessive scope to doctors to follow their own personal views or it means even if they want to give the treatment, they’ll fall foul of the law,” he said. Halappanavar’s death has dominated debate in Ireland’s parliament since news of it broke on Wednesday. Her photograph was spread across front pages of all Ireland’s major newspapers on Thursday, while editorials demanded action from politicians. The fact that she is a foreign national has heightened the government’s embarrassment. The story was on the front of several large Indian newspapers and family members were featured on national television. The Indian government said on Thursday it deeply regretted Halappanavar’s death. “The death of an Indian national in such circumstances is a matter of concern,” a spokesman said.",true,Health News

Really, Trump wasn’t “ahead of the curve,” as Santorum said. He was following the advice of experts in his own administration – and the actions of the industry directly affected by the move. And about 45 nations restricted travel from China before the United States.",Jessica Calefati,"Former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum on Monday defended President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak in an interview with CNN anchor John King. ""The president looks like he was ahead of the curve – as you know, he talks about this all the time – on shutting down travel from China,"" said Santorum, a Republican from Pennsylvania who lost his bid for a third term in 2006. Santorum’s comments came one day after Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told CNN anchor Jake Tapper that earlier implementation of social-distancing and stay-at-home orders could have saved lives lost to the coronavirus. Santorum called Fauci’s remarks ""Monday morning quarterbacking"" and sought to redirect attention to other coronavirus mitigation strategies he believes the Trump administration embraced early on. Fauci, later on Monday, said his remarks were hypothetical. We wondered whether Trump’s decision to restrict travel from China was as prescient as Santorum described. The administration announced the restrictions on Jan. 31 and they took effect two days later. The policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens who had traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the country. Trump has repeatedly said he acted to restrict travel – first from China, then from Iran and finally from Europe – despite objections from experts. ""But we closed those borders very early, against the advice of a lot of professionals, and we turned out to be right. I took a lot of heat for that,"" Trump said on March 4. Later that same day, Trump spoke about the rationale behind his decision, telling Fox anchor Sean Hannity, ""Everybody said, it’s too early, it’s too soon, and good people, brilliant people, in many ways, doctors and lawyers and, frankly, a lot of people that work on this stuff almost exclusively. And they said, don’t do it."" Trump repeated the claim again at the Scranton town hall he held on March 5, saying he imposed the travel restrictions ""against the advice of almost everybody."" The World Health Organization did caution against the overuse of travel restrictions around the time the one imposed by the U.S. first took effect, but public health officials in this country and many airlines themselves agreed on the policy’s importance. Several airlines voluntarily halted flights between the U.S. and China a few days before the administration’s travel restrictions took effect. And Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said experts in his department all agreed that restricting travel from countries with coronavirus outbreaks was the right call. ""The travel restrictions that we put in place in consultation with the president were very measured and incremental,"" Azar told reporters on Feb. 7. ""These were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS."" What was the rest of the world thinking at the same time? We consulted Think Global Health, an initiative of the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations that is tracking travel restrictions on China due to COVID-19. By the group’s count, about 45 nations restricted travel from China before the United States. That number covers variations of travel restrictions in effect up to and including Feb. 1. Think Global Health’s tracker includes partial or total land border closures, suspension of flights to and from China, visa restrictions, such as a pause on visa-on-arrival programs, and entry restrictions (similar to what the United States implemented). ""While the United States was not one of the first countries to impose restrictions against travel from China, nor was it late to do so relative to the actions of others,"" said Samantha Kiernan, a research associate at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Rather, the United States acted around the same time that many other countries did."" Santorum said, ""The president looks like he was ahead of the curve – as you know, he talks about this all the time – on shutting down travel from China."" Trump wasn’t ""ahead of the curve,"" as Santorum said. He was following the advice of experts in his own administration – and the actions of the industry directly affected by the move.

The move marks the first time the company has recalled its iconic baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time U.S. regulators have announced a finding of asbestos in the product. Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma. The recall is the latest blow to the more than 130-year-old U.S. healthcare conglomerate that is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including baby powder, opioids, medical devices and the antipsychotic Risperdal. A jury last week ordered the company to pay $8 billion to a plaintiff in a case claiming J&J downplayed the risks of Risperdal. That award is not expected to stand, the company and legal experts have said. J&J faces more than 15,000 lawsuits from consumers claiming its talc products, including Johnson’s Baby Powder, caused their cancer. On a conference call with reporters on Friday, Dr. Susan Nicholson, head of Women’s Health in the company’s medical safety organization, called the asbestos finding “extremely unusual,” adding that it was “inconsistent with our testing to date.”  The voluntary recall announced on Friday is limited to one lot of Johnson’s Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, the company said. J&J in a news release said that testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as recently as a month ago found no asbestos in their talc. The FDA said in a statement that the latest sampling took place during its testing for asbestos in talc-containing cosmetics that it began reporting this year. A second Johnson’s Baby Powder sample from a different lot tested negative for asbestos, the agency said. The FDA said it stands by the quality of its testing and results and recommended consumers stop using the product if it comes from the affected lot. J&J said on the conference call that it received a report from the FDA on Oct. 17 alerting the company about the asbestos finding. It said it has started an investigation and is reviewing manufacturing records and collecting data on the distribution of the lot to determine where the product was shipped. J&J added that it is working with the FDA to determine the integrity of the tested sample as well as the validity of test results. The type of asbestos discovered by FDA testing has not been found in the mine where the company sources its talc, J&J’s Nicholson said. She described it as an environmental contaminant most commonly found in building materials and industrial applications. J&J said it was too early to confirm whether cross-contamination of the sample had caused a false positive, whether the sample was taken from a bottle with an intact seal or whether the it was prepared in a controlled environment. It added that it could not confirm whether the tested product was authentic or counterfeit. “It is so critical that we perform a thorough investigation of the sample to determine the source of contamination,” Nicholson said. Since 2003, talc in Johnson’s Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys Talc America, a unit of Paris-based Imerys SA and a co-defendant in much of the talc litigation. Imerys and J&J said the Chinese talc is safe. J&J has known for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc, Reuters reported last year. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. Company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it, while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public, Reuters found. J&J has repeatedly said that its talc products are safe, and that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer. The FDA test indicated the presence of no greater than 0.00002% of chrysotile asbestos in the tested sample, J&J said. The World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later. Thousands of the lawsuits against J&J have been consolidated before a New Jersey federal judge, who is currently weighing company motions to disqualify plaintiffs’ expert witnesses, including the head of an asbestos testing lab who has testified in earlier trials that he found the contaminant in J&J powders. Leigh O’Dell, one of the lead plaintiff attorneys, on Friday said the recall “vindicates the position we’ve been taking for months.”  Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said in a research note that the recall could encourage additional lawsuits and prompt the company to pursue a broader settlement. Jefferies healthcare strategist Jared Holz said J&J has already lost close to $10 billion in market value due to the talc issue over the past year. He said further downside to J&J stock is likely to be limited because legal concerns over talc are well known and have already taken a toll on the share price. “This is one single bottle within one lot with barely a trace here,” he said. J&J said in February that it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission for documents related to the asbestos contamination allegations. A Bloomberg report, which Reuters has confirmed, said those inquiries include a criminal grand jury investigation into how forthright J&J has been in its statements about the safety of its powders. While talc products make up less than 1% of J&J sales expected by analysts to reach $82 billion in 2019, the New Jersey-based healthcare-products maker considers its Baby Powder to be an essential facet of a carefully tended image as a caring company.",true,Health News
166,9289,Definitive tests for irritable bowel syndrome developed at Cedars-Sinai: New blood tests will speed up diagnosis for the most common GI disorder,"May 21, 2015","Image from ibschek.com The release states that two “simple” new blood tests can be used to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by detecting antibodies that signal the presence of toxins that can cause IBS. This diagnosis, in turn, would allow patients to receive treatment more quickly. But the release has many problems that start with the headline, which claims there is now a “definitive” test for IBS. That’s an exaggeration, as the findings need further validation and they apply only to a subset of patients with diarrhea as their main symptom — something the release never explains. The release also glosses over some significant points — such as the fact that there were only 43 control patients (too small a group to draw “definitive” conclusions), and that there’s no evidence that treating patients based on these test results will actually improve their outcomes. The cost of the test and its potential harms — e.g. false-positive results that lead to unnecessary or misguided treatment — also aren’t explored in any way. [Editor’s note: We’ve also published a review of a CBS News story about the test that shares many of the same shortcomings as this release.] While it’s not clear how many people suffer from IBS, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDKD) reports that IBS affects at least 3 percent of the adult population — and probably closer to 10 or 15 percent of the adult population. The term “IBS” refers to a range of bowel symptoms including pain, constipation, and/or diarrhea. IBS is not meant to represent a single underlying cause, but in fact may represent a number of different conditions that result in functional bowel symptoms. This news release refers to an attempt to develop a test to better categorize certain patients with IBS. Though the news release implies the test is for all patients with IBS, in fact it evaluated two tests for individuals with IBS who had diarrhea as the predominant symptom. The implication that these tests may provide a diagnosis for IBS more broadly is not correct. Whether these tests hold up as being accurate when applied more broadly to patients with IBS and other related bowel conditions remains to be proven. It would also be important to see how common the test is positive in individuals without chronic bowel symptoms. Finally, even if these tests are specific for individuals with diarrhea-predominant IBS, it’s unclear if it would make any difference in their treatment or lead to a reduction in the severity of symptoms. That’s a premise that still needs to be tested.","Matt Shipman,Steven J. Atlas, MD, MPH,Kevin Lomangino","The story does not address the cost of the IBS diagnostic tests at all. A consumer website for the tests, which are sold by Commonwealth Laboratories Inc., also did not include information about the cost of the tests. The benefits of these tests would be a clear and early diagnosis, allowing patients to receive relevant treatment earlier. But the release’s statement that the blood tests identify these antibodies with 90% certainty is at best misleading. The story never points out that only 33% to 44% of patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS tested positive — suggesting that most people with IBS will test negative (even though they do, in fact, have IBS). Any release about a new test should explain both the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Moreover, the release doesn’t tell readers that there is no cure for IBS. Instead, as the NIDDKD notes on its site, doctors “can manage the [IBS] symptoms with a combination of diet, medicines, probiotics, and therapies for mental health problems. You may have to try a few treatments to see what works best for you.” Or, as the Mayo Clinic summarizes, “treatment focuses on the relief of symptoms so that you can live as normally as possible.” Even without a confirmed diagnosis of IBS, patients would be able to share symptoms with their doctors. As a result, the physical health benefit here may be negligible. No test is 100% accurate. A wrong test result may lead doctors to causes that may not actually be the problem. As such it may lead to inappropriate treatments. That’s a harm that should have been mentioned. While the release does note the overall size (“nearly 3,000 people”) and general outlines of the study, it’s characterization of the evidence is misleading. First, this isn’t a test for IBS in general. It is a test for patients with chronic diarrhea – or IBS with diarrhea as the primary component. The release is simply wrong to use the general term “IBS” to describe this subgroup of IBS patients. Second, the release doesn’t describe that while the IBS population is large, there were only 43 control patients. It is hard to know how specific the test is without testing in more controls. In addition, the study reported (but the release didn’t mention) that the test wasn’t as good for differentiating IBS from celiac disease, and that 10-15% of inflammatory bowel disease patients (especially Crohn’s disease) also have IBS, so there’s no perfect test for these patients. Finally, such a study needs to be repeated in a new population. Tests and their thresholds are never quite as good when applied to new populations — something that wasn’t done here. The release says IBS affects “nearly 40 million people” in the U.S., and “an estimated 10 percent of the world’s population.” But this isn’t a test for IBS — it’s a test for those with the diarrhea predominant version. It’s not clear how many people we’re talking about, but according to this study, less than half of the people with IBS meet the criteria for the diarrhea-predominant version. The release exaggerates the potential impact of the test in a way that promotes a commercial interest, so we’ll flag it for disease mongering. We give the release credit here. It clearly notes that the lead author receives consulting fees from Commonwealth Laboratories — which is the company marketing these tests. And that Cedars-Sinai has a license agreement with the company for patent applications covering the blood tests, The release says that IBS has been “nearly impossible to diagnose until now.” But the release also says IBS “is the most common gastroenterological disorder in the United States.” There’s a clear disconnect between these two statements. IBS may not be easy to diagnose, but it is diagnosed. Often, an IBS diagnosis is reached after other conditions have been ruled out. A diagnosis may also come after extensive additional testing. In other words, the new blood tests would be a significantly quicker and easier way to reach diagnosis. But the release should have simply said that. The release clearly states that the tests are already on the market. These are the first blood tests for diagnosing IBS caused by food poisoning, and the release says so. This is a big one. The headline of the release states that “Definitive tests for irritable bowel syndrome developed…”. However, it would be far more accurate to say that “Reasonably accurate tests for diagnosing diarrhea-predominant IBS caused by food poisoning developed…”. The tests are a significant advance, but are still far from foolproof — after all, “more than 90 percent accurate” is also “almost 10 percent inaccurate.” Further, it’s not clear how many cases of IBS are caused by food poisoning, or whether identifying such patients with this test will improve their outcomes. All in all, not nearly as “simple” as the release suggests.",false,"Cedars-Sinai,irritable bowel syndrome,news release spin"

James Crane worked on the 101st of Tower 1 of the World Trade Center. He is blind so he has a golden retriever named Daisy. After the plane hit 20 stories below, James knew that he was doomed, so he let Daisy go out as an act of love. With tears in her eyes she darted away into the darkened hallway. Choking on the fumes of the jet fuel and the smoke he was just waiting to die … About 30 minutes later, Daisy comes back along with James’ boss, who Daisy just happened to pick up on floor 112. On her first run of the building, she leads James, James’ boss and about 300 more people out of the doomed building. But she wasn’t through yet, she knew there were others who were trapped. So, highly against James’ wishes she ran back in the building. On her second run, she saved 392 lives. Again she went back in. During this run, the building collapses. James hears about this and falls on his knees into tears. Against all known odds, Daisy makes it out alive, but this time she is carried by a firefighter. “She lead us right to the people, before she got injured” the fireman explained. Her final run saved other 273 lives. She suffered acute smoke inhalation, severe burns on all four paws, and a broken leg, but she saved 967 lives. The next week, Mayor Guilaini rewards Daisy with the Canine medal of Honor of New York. Daisy is the first civilian Canine to win such an honor. This is a case of the heroic rescue that wasn’t: This widely circulated Internet tale of canine courage is pure fiction. No dog, of any type or name, rescued several hundred people from the World Trade Center towers on 9/11. One of this fictional item’s more obvious tipoffs was the claim that the imaginary dog went to the 112th floor of the damaged tower to retrieve more victims in need of rescuing — an impossibility, as both World Trade Center towers topped out at 110 floors. One version of the Internet forward concluded with “copied from NEW YORK TIMES 9-19-01.” That claim is as fake as the rest of the piece: no such article ran in the New York Times or in any other publication, on that date or any other. At least two men were guided to safety from the World Trade Center buildings by their guide dogs: Michael Hingson from the 78th floor by Roselle, and Omar Rivera from the 71st floor by Salty. Neither dog returned to those buildings to rescue others, though. Roselle and Salty received a joint Dickin Medal for their actions on 9/11, as did a NYPD Search and Rescue dog named Appollo, but no dog was given the “Canine Medal of Honor of New York” (an award that does not exist) by New York mayor Rudy Guilaini in connect with the 9/11 attacks.",false,"September 11th, 9/11, animals, dogs"
173,9009,"Brain scans may help diagnose neurological, psychiatric disorders","April 23, 2018","This news release reports findings from a study of functional MRI (fcMRI) scans in which researchers analyzed data from more than 10 hours of fcMRI scans on each of nine people. During the scans, each person performed a variety of tasks to determine the extent to which their behaviors altered the picture of their brain activity. The researchers found that each person’s brain imaging changed little from day-to-day or task-to-task. That is, the brain scans appeared to reflect fundamental, stable features of the brain. The release suggests that, based on these findings, its possible to use this type of brain scan to diagnose individual traits or diseases. That is very premature. Diagnostic tests have yet to be developed. The release headline promises more than the news release delivers, and there’s a real question as to whether this information is useful to the public, or just misleading. The heading of this news release proclaims hopefully that “Brain scans may help diagnose neurological, psychiatric disorders.”  Whereas at present depression, bipolar disorder, and many other mental illnesses can only be diagnosed based on self-reported symptoms or observations of behavior, this release suggests we are on the verge of being able to diagnose these conditions via a particular type of MRI. However, the study referred to simply laid the groundwork for research testing whether functional networks in individuals’ brains are relatively stable over time. Diagnostic applications remain to be developed.","Ann Miller, PhD,Susan Molchan, MD, MA,Kathlyn Stone","No mention is made of the cost of functional MRIs, or how likely it is that insurance companies might cover that cost. Some numbers would have been helpful here to put the findings in context. Consistency of the brain scans for the various mental tasks is not quantified in the news release. Furthermore, contrary to the implications of the headline, this study didn’t actually develop any diagnostic tools for depression, migraines, or other brain ailments. It simply laid the groundwork for research about these issues by testing whether functional networks in individuals’ brains are relatively stable over time. That’s a preliminary step that is needed, but it’s still preliminary. No mention is made of discomforts or potential dangers associated with MRIs. The news release goes into some detail about the number of people and hours of brain activity that were measured, with 333 different areas of participants’ brains identified and compared. A sample of nine people is small, but 10 hours of data per volunteer provided researchers with 90 hours of fcMRI data to analyze.

175,2107,"Ban trans fats and cut salt, demands UK health body.","June 21, 2010",Britain’s influential health cost watchdog called on Tuesday for major changes in food production and marketing and said drastic cuts in fat and salt levels were needed to halt the scourge of heart disease.,Kate Kelland,"The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) said trans fats, which do little more than prolong shelf life, should be banned from all food, saturated fat levels cut drastically and average salt intake more than halved by 2025. If these changes were implemented, around 40,000 early deaths could be prevented each year in Britain alone and millions of people could spared the suffering of living with the effects of heart disease and stroke, NICE said. Mike Kelly, NICE’s director for public health, said the financial costs of heart disease added up to around 30 billion pounds ($44.5 billion) a year in Britain, taking in treatment costs, lost productivity, care and other social costs. “This is a big ticket item. And it is something that is eminently within our power to do something about,” he told a briefing. “This isn’t some mystery virus which we don’t understand ... this is something where we know precisely what the causes are and we know precisely what we can do about it.”   NICE does not produce legislation but it is asked by the government to draw up health policy guidelines. NICE said policymakers should aim to reduce average adult salt intake in Britain to 3 grams a day by 2025 from around 8.5 grams now and introduce laws on cuts if necessary. Politicians were also urged to negotiate at European Union and national level to ensure agricultural policy took account of public health issues. Kelly said this meant encouraging farmers to concentrate on producing high quality food such as fruits and vegetables, low fat dairy products, lean meats and whole grains. It also urged the government to tighten planning laws to stop fast-food outlets setting up too close to schools, and said legislation should be considered to force the food industry to cut saturated fat levels if they would not do so voluntarily. The European Society of Cardiology praised NICE for setting out “a range of evidence-based recommendations for effective action” to help reduce levels of heart disease and said its guidelines also had “important messages for the rest of Europe.”   “This is an extremely strong document that clearly underlines how much can be gained ... by introducing legislative changes protecting the content of diets,” said ESC spokesman Lars Ryden from the Sweden’s Karolinska Institute. NICE, which produced its guidelines on preventing heart disease after two years of work, cited scientific research showing that in countries such as Japan, the United States, Denmark and Finland — where some laws are in place banning certain fats and forcing lower in salt levels — dramatic health benefits swiftly follow. “The benefits of doing this will be seen remarkably quickly, within 2-3 years,” said Simon Capewell, a member of NICE’s panel and a professor of epidemiology at Liverpool University. He said that if salt levels in food were gradually reduced by between 5 and 10 percent a year, most consumers would not notice any difference in taste. This suggests the food industry, which has sometimes argued that consumers complain if it cuts food salt levels too far, has little to back such claims. Cutting salt intake substantially reduces blood pressure, helping to lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

178,33407,"The opening line of the Christmas carol ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" means ""God make you mighty, gentlemen.","December 5, 2013",The opening line of the Christmas carol 'God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen' is not a reference to the Lord's bestowing might upon Christians.,David Mikkelson,"In recent years every Christmas season has been accompanied a number of stories about the so-called “War on Christmas,” a term which refers to supposed efforts by government, businesses, and non-religious groups and organizations to disassociate the celebration of Christmas from Christianity and instead focus on its secular aspects (or to replace the celebration of Christmas with a generic winter “holiday”). Although it is much less common and it doesn’t have a catchy name, the reverse phenomenon also occurs: attempts are made by Christians to infuse secular elements of Christmas with religious symbolism and meaning they did not originally possess. Thus every Christmas season also brings the circulation of apocryphal tales about how candy canes were created to symbolize Jesus, and how persecuted Catholics secretly encoded tenets of their faith into the song “The Twelve Days of Christmas.”  Another example in the latter vein is the claim that the Christmas carol “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” originated in the 15th century as a reaction to  the “dark, somber [Christmas] songs usually written in Latin” of the time, and that its title phrase would more meaningfully be rendered in modern English as “God make you mighty, gentlemen”:  One of the best loved Christmas music is the song “God rest ye merry, gentlemen.” The lyrics are quite odd as we study it. God rest ye merry, gentlemen Let nothing you dismay Remember, Christ, our Saviour Was born on Christmas day To save us all from Satan’s power When we were gone astray O tidings of comfort and joy,  It is a song that depicts the gospel — Christ came, destroy the works of the devil and now we can rest and have comfort and joy — thus we say MERRY CHRISTMAS, right? Wrong if you trace the real meaning of the word merry in old english. In Old English the word merry could mean happy but it is also used in place of the word mighty. Examples would be Robin Hood’s merry (mighty) men. The merry men were not some happy go lucky bunch but were men that King Richards fear. The nation of Great Britain was called “Merry Old England” — which was a powerful nation back then. The sentence EAT, DRINK and BE MERRY was used during war times when soldiers would have to eat and drink because tomorrow they conquer. Thus knowing the origin of the words would make our Christmas different. Knowing the true meaning of Christmas is pretty much huge. Merry is not Santa Clause and all things cute about Christmas Merry is MIGHTY. It is when Jesus came down on earth, born in a manger, grew up as a carpenter and was laser focused on his mission — to destroy the works of the devil and to save mankind from sin. Now that is Merry Mighty Christmas!!!! You have heard it said, “Things aren’t always what they appear to be.” Well, when we sing the Christmas carol, God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen, this saying is certainly true. With the changing of word meanings and difference in cultures, it is hard for Americans today to understand what the English peasants were singing about 500 years ago — unless you know the story behind the song. The 15th century church sang only dark, somber songs usually written in Latin. When Christmas rolled around each year, songs of joy and happiness were not allowed in the church. To overcome this problem, the people took the singing of Christmas songs to the streets of jolly old London town. Soon, the waites, the night watchmen of that time, would be singing God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen as they walked the streets of London. Even Charles Dickens would include the song in his classic A Christmas Carol. This song was popular with the people because of a very strong message — one we desperately need today. Each Christmas, we greet each other with the word merry, meaning happy. Back in the Middle Ages, the word “merry” meant great and mighty. For example, Robin Hood’s merry men might be better understood as mighty men. Then, there’s the word “rest.” The meaning back then was keep or make. These original meanings would be clearer today with the addition of a modern comma. Thus, the true meaning of the song is “God make you mighty, gentlemen,” which is a message for back then and a message for today. So many, at Christmas time, will never hear or see the true reason for this holiday which is Christ’s birth. The activities, the distractions, the lack of time and money, will rob most of this important message. They will be deceived into thinking it’s just another Merry Christmas, and the New Year will bring more heartache and pain. We, as mighty men and women, can make a difference this Christmas by living our faith before them. Amid the holly and the tinsel, we can tell them that Christ was born to die and that, in Him, we might live forever. God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen is more than just a Christmas carol. It’s our rallying song to show the world that, at Christmas time, things aren’t always what they appear to be. Although “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” has always been an undeniably religious (rather than secular) Christmas carol, the additional elements that are now claimed of it are not supported by textual and linguistic analysis:     o England was not known as “Merry England” (or “Merrie Old England”) because England was mighty or powerful; that term refers to an idealized conception of pastoral English life in which the word “merry” meant “bountiful” or “prosperous.” o Robin Hood’s “Merry Men” did not come by that title because they were a band of mighty adventurers (nor because they were a happy and upbeat group), but rather because “merry man” was a late 14th century term used to refer to a companion in arms, such as someone who followed a knight or an outlaw. o The phrase “eat, drink, and be merry” derives from the Old Testament book of Ecclesiastes (8:15) and the New Testament book of Luke (12:19), not from an exhortation to soldiers heading off to war, and it is clear from the contexts in which the phrase appears (regardless of which English translation of the Bible one chooses) that the word “merry” is intended to convey a sense of joyfulness, not might:  Ecclesiastes 8:15: “Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.” Luke 12:19: “And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.”  The notion that this phrase applied to soldiers stems from the form “Let us eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,” which derives from Isaiah 22:13. However, that Biblical verse refers only to eating and drinking; it includes no mention of being merry (or any other synonym of merriment):   Isaiah 22:13: “And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we shall die.”      There is at least one small element of truth to these otherwise inaccurate claims, though: The song’s titular phrase is often mispunctuated as “God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen” rather than “God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen” thereby mistakenly implying that the gentlemen of note have made so much merry that God need ease them to sleep:  First of all, “God rest you merry, gentlemen” is correct, not “God rest you, merry gentlemen.”  The verb “rest” is used here in the way now most familiar from the phrase “rest assured”. In earlier English it was used with a variety of other complements:  the OED has “rest thee merry” from 1400; “rest you well” from 1420; “God rest you merry”, “rest you fair”, and “rest you happy”, and “rest myself content” from Shakespeare; “rest thee tranquil” from Shelley, and “rest thee sure” from Tennyson. The song is now widely misunderstood as being addressed to “merry gentlemen”, first because this use of “rest” is now obsolete except in the phrases “rest assured” and “rest easy”, and secondly because the [melody now commonly used with these lyrics] supports that stress pattern.",false,"Holidays, christmas"
179,8967,"Scans cut heart attack rates and save lives, major study finds","August 28, 2018","This brief news release describes a single positive finding from the 4,000-patient SCOT-HEART study:  roughly half of patients with stable chest pain who were randomized to receive computed tomography angiogram (CTA) and standard care had fewer heart attacks over 5 years than those who received standard care alone. But there’s a flaw in the headline and first sentence of the release. This study shows zero difference in deaths, and as the authors acknowledge in the published study, the entire difference between the groups was driven by non-fatal heart attacks. Another problem with the news release is that these benefits are expressed in dramatic relative terms, instead of the much more modest (and helpful) absolute terms. Readers are left with little guidance regarding what may account for the slight drop, and if this really represents a “major” reduction as claimed by the lead author. Finally, readers would have been better served if a discussion of alternative screening methods, conflicts of interest, and potential downstream costs and risks had been included. As a positive, the release mentions the potential to avoid invasive testing via angiogram, which has a very real death rate. What may really be at issue here is whether roughly $1 million scanners are truly better than the non-invasive tests we already have. It remains unclear which patients benefit most from these tests, whether the scans provide actionable information (or simply lead to further confirmatory tests), and what will be their true costs.","Michael Joyce, MD,Virginia A. Moyer, MD,Kathlyn Stone","The news release mentions that a computed tomographic angiogram (CTA) is cheaper than traditional angiograms but neither a cost or a rough cost comparison of the procedures is given. There are also other costs to consider since a positive CTA will often lead to further testing. The study (but not the release) explained that further testing was examined as part of the analysis but no difference was observed — that’s one of the strengths of this study. We’re told the diagnostic procedure: Supporting data from the study are not provided. It appears the release misinterpreted the results. As noted above, it would have been preferable to include absolute and not just relative numbers. The release notes that CTA scans are “safer” than angiograms because CTAs don’t require the insertion of tubes into the body. But no other harms are mentioned and many readers may want to know about radiation exposure and allergic responses to the contrast dye used. According to the study,  those who did have a CTA scan ended up having more invasive coronary angiograms and coronary opening procedures in the months following the scan. These procedures carry considerable risks. The lead author is quoted as saying the study shows a “major” reduction in the future risk of heart attacks, and this has “major” implications for the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected heart disease. But the 40% drop in heart attacks noted in the 5-year follow-up period is a relative reduction. The absolute decrease measured was from 3.9% to 2.3%, or an absolute drop of 1.6%. That is quite modest. Also, as mentioned in an editorial accompanying the study, “the benefit seen in the CTA group might be attributable mostly to changes in medical management that were made on the basis of the testing results.” There is no disease mongering. Some information on the prevalence of heart attacks among the patient population would put the problem in context. National funding sources of the study are mentioned. What’s not mentioned is that the lead author quoted in the release receives grant funding from Siemens, a major manufacturer of CTA scanners. No mention is made of other non-invasive tests used to screen for coronary artery disease, such as calcium scans, exercise ECG’s, echocardiography, and nuclear heart scans to name a few. These alternatives are named in the published study. It’s not clear from the release just how available CTA scanners are. The lead author is quoted as saying: This is the first time the CT-guided management has been shown to improve patient outcomes with a major reduction in the future risk of heart attacks. There are other studies — most notably the PROMISE trial — which followed patients for just 2 years and found no changes in patient outcomes when comparing CTA with other noninvasive screening tests. This study followed patients for 5 years to see if the differences persisted and they didn’t. The title is misleading because it implies it’s the scan itself that cuts heart attack risk and save lives. But the study cannot account for whether this risk reduction — which was quite modest — may be attributable to lifestyle changes subsequent to the scan, or that the findings from the scan lead to more aggressive pharmaceutical management of risk factors. The published study notes that this is likely the case — and that’s the whole point — having more accurate diagnoses may have the downstream effect of better management.",false,"heart disease,heart scans,University of Edinburgh'"
180,1744,Methamphetamine use soars in Iran as lifestyles speed up.,"December 8, 2014","Women in headscarves and men in tatty clothes puff on a glass pipe as smoke swirls around their faces. The pictures published by Iranian media and blogs in recent months are a sign of a new drug epidemic: shishe, or methamphetamine.",Babak Dehghanpisheh,"Shishe means “glass” in Farsi, a reference to the appearance of the drug in some of its purest forms. In less than a decade, methamphetamine use has skyrocketed in Iran to the point where now about 345,000 Iranians are considered addicts, according to official statistics. Seizures of methamphetamine soared 128 percent between 2008 and 2012, topping all other countries in the region, according to figures compiled by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Last year alone, the government of Iran confiscated 3.6 tonnes of shishe. A top official from the Iran Drug Control Headquarters said last year that shishe could be found in Tehran in “less than five minutes,” according to the Iranian Students’ News Agency. Shishe addicts in Iran are mostly urban, middle class and young, experts say. Notably, there are a large number of women who abuse shishe, too. One of the main reasons why shishe use has spread quickly in Iran is a lack of information about the drug, which has led casual users to believe, erroneously, that it is not addictive, experts say. Struggling university students have begun abusing it to stay up longer and try to boost their performance in school. Women have been sold the drug in beauty salons with the promise that it will help them lose weight, according to local media reports. “We really had a hard time convincing people that this is addiction,” said Azaraksh Mokri, a psychiatrist who teaches at the Tehran University of Medical Sciences and has dealt extensively with the issue of shishe addiction. Opium addiction has long been a problem in Iran partly because of a tolerance for its use even in conservative rural areas, and also because of the country’s long border with Afghanistan, for decades one of the top opium producers. Opium is still the most abused drug in Iran, according to official statistics. Shishe began to make inroads in the country about a decade ago, luring users who preferred its effects as a stimulant to  the more soporific opium, which was seen as a drug of the poor and elderly. That shift has been characterized as a change between drugs which are known as sonati, or traditional, and those that are sanaati, or manufactured, according to local media. The use of shishe was partly driven by increased development in the country and more complicated and faster-paced lifestyles, experts say. Initially, the drug was imported but it later began to be produced locally. UNODC figures show that the domestic use of pseudoephedrine, one of the key ingredients for making shishe, jumped from five tonnes in 2006 to 55 tonnes in 2012. Drug use and addiction is so prevalent in Iran that it is the second highest cause of death in the country after traffic accidents, a senior official from the Iran Drug Control Headquarters said in early November, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. Iran has some of the harshest drug laws in the region, regularly executing smugglers and drug peddlers. At the same time, the country has had a degree of success in the treatment of addiction, experts say. “Shishe is something that in a short time, in comparison to other things, has very severe effects on behavior,” said Said Kafrashi, an advisory physician and therapist at the Aayandeh addiction rehabilitation clinic in Tehran. The clinic often tries to bring families of shishe addicts into the rehabilitation process in order to examine all the social factors that may have led to the drug use. “The family plays a role here,” said Kafrashi. “In light of the individual’s behavior, the family needs to change their behavior too.”  Still, despite some success in the treatment of shishe addiction, Iran’s battle with the drug is far from over. “We need to do something so that they don’t die, don’t kill themselves, don’t kill others, and don’t get psychosis so they can mature out and get out,” said Mokri.",true,Health News
181,31622,Bill Gates has openly admitted that vaccinations are designed so that governments can depopulate the world.,"March 10, 2017","This is obviously a far cry from, as YourNewsWire.com puts it, having Bill Gates tell us “how we must all consent to a ‘kill the humans’ strategy, to ‘save the planet’ from the carbon dioxide we make.”",Alex Kasprak,"On 21 January 2016, dubious news and conspiracy theory site YourNewsWire.com published a story with the headline “Bill Gates Admits ‘Vaccines Are Best Way To Depopulate’”. The article opens with a damning claim: Bill Gates has openly admitted that vaccinations are designed so that governments can depopulate the world. To support this claim, the site presented a February 2011 clip of Bill Gates being interviewed by CNN’s Sanjay Gupta about his foundation’s vaccination efforts: Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Ten billion dollars over the next 10 years to make it “the year of the vaccines.” What does that mean exactly? Bill Gates: Over this decade, we believe unbelievable progress can be made, in both inventing new vaccines and making sure they get out to all the children who need them. […] we only need about six or seven more — and then you would have all the tools to reduce childhood death, reduce population growth, and everything — the stability, the environment — benefits from that. To make sure the point was not lost on the reader, YNW repeated the “reduce population growth”, emphasized above, numerous times at a variety of different playback speeds, as if to suggest this was a slip of the tongue revealing some nefarious secret. This narrative is reinforced with another video that opens with this text: Next are two short excerpts from a recently filmed TED presentation (Feb 2010) by none other than Bill “Microsoft” Gates. […] As Gates casually addresses the issue [of reducing carbon emissions], he goes on to state that one way to accomplish this goal is to reduce the global human population. In the first clip you will hear him state in plain language that he considers VACCINES to be desirable to that end. You will also casually hear him promoting HEALTH CARE and REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, to accomplish that same goal. In the second excerpt you will hear Gates again confirming his profound affection for vaccines. The damming moment, according to YourNewsWire.com, was the following statement from Gates: First, we’ve got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent […]. The suggestion, hinted at by both of these clips and argued later in the article, is that Gates knows vaccines are dangerous — and he is using this information to kill children in the developing world to stem population growth. In reality, however, Gates’ statements regarding vaccines and population growth were neither an accidental slip nor a nefarious admission of plans for a new world order. As discussed in a 21 November 2011 Forbes cover story profiling the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, reducing population growth has always been integral to their stated mission of “improving people’s health and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty”: In 1997, when he and Melinda first ventured into public health […] they focused on birth control, funding a Johns Hopkins effort to use computers to help women in the developing world learn about contraception. The logic was crisp and Bill Gates-friendly. Health = resources ÷ people. And since resources, as Gates noted, are relatively fixed, the answer lay in population control. As further discussed in this piece, Gates later came to the conclusion that birth control was not the best approach to achieve the goal of slower population growth, instead realizing that — counterintuitively — a reduction in childhood mortality was the best way to limit population growth: In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. This is a point Gates has made repeatedly, and his views were clearly articulated in the 2009 Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Annual Letter: A surprising but critical fact we learned was that reducing the number of deaths actually reduces population growth. […] Contrary to the Malthusian view that population will grow to the limit of however many kids can be fed, in fact parents choose to have enough kids to give them a high chance that several will survive to support them as they grow old. As the number of kids who survive to adulthood goes up, parents can achieve this goal without having as many children. In other words, Gates is not interested in using vaccines to reduce the population by using them as an agent of death or a tool to sterilize unsuspecting masses. Rather, Gates is interested in keeping more children alive in order to reduce the need for parents to have more children, thus limiting the overall population growth rate. As evidenced in a 2014 paper in Science that attempted to calculate future population growth, not everyone is convinced childhood mortality is the smoking gun to quell population growth: Among the most robust empirical findings in the literature on fertility transitions are that higher contraceptive use and higher female education are associated with faster fertility decline. These suggest that the projected rapid population growth could be moderated by greater investments in family planning programs to satisfy the unmet need for contraception and in girls’ education. But Gates’ view on childhood mortality contribution to population growth is increasingly discussed in the scientific literature and is still subject to debate. What is not up to debate are the intentions of the Bill and Melinda Gate’s Foundation with regard to vaccines and population growth, as articulated by Bill and Melinda Gates in their Foundation’s 2017 Annual Letter: Melinda: Saving children’s lives is the goal that launched our global work. It’s an end in itself. But then we learned it has all these other benefits as well. If parents believe their children will survive—and if they have the power to time and space their pregnancies—they choose to have fewer children. Bill: When a mother can choose how many children to have, her children are healthier, they’re better nourished, their mental capacities are higher—and parents have more time and money to spend on each child’s health and schooling. That’s how families and countries get out of poverty. This link between saving lives, a lower birthrate, and ending poverty was the most important early lesson Melinda and I learned about global health.",false,"Medical, bill gates, childhood mortality, gates foundation"

Still, experts said Clinton’s claim is close to accurate.",Louis Jacobson,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton recently announced a $10 billion proposal for treating drug and alcohol addiction. While addiction and treatment has not traditionally been a top-tier issue in presidential races, it has attracted concern in key caucus and primary states this year, including New Hampshire, where Clinton announced her proposal in an op-ed in the New Hampshire Union-Leader. In explaining why an assertive policy response was necessary, Clinton wrote in the op-ed, among other claims, that ""23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get treatment."" We wondered if her figures are accurate. On the ratio, Clinton is close. The most recent data from the federally sponsored National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated that 22.7 million Americans needed treatment for a drug alcohol problem but only about 2.5 million received treatment ""at a specialty facility."" That means 11 percent of people who conceivably could have needed treatment at a specialty facility received it, or one out of every nine. This ratio has held steady over the years, said Arthur Robinson Williams, a fellow in the division on substance abuse in Columbia University’s Department of Psychiatry. ""The 2013 survey was consistent with prior findings and estimates,"" Williams said. Still, we wondered about the survey’s use of the term ""specialty facility."" What does that mean? We found the definition: It refers to ""treatment received at drug or alcohol rehabilitation facilities (inpatient or outpatient), hospitals (inpatient services only), and mental health centers; it excludes treatment received in an emergency room, private doctor's office, self-help group, prison or jail, or hospital as an outpatient."" Among the forms of treatment not counted are groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Not everyone agrees that AA is effective (or effective for everyone), and it is perhaps most helpful as reinforcement to other types of treatment led by clinicians. Still, the number of participants is hardly trivial: AA counted 1,283,704 members in the United States as of Jan. 1, 2015, plus an additional 35,349 in correctional facilities. Thousands more attended Narcotics Anonymous and other 12-step groups.

""Treatment in doctor’s offices is a relatively recent development, as medication-assisted addiction treatment through the medical care system has achieved regulatory approval.""

Boston Scientific is still forging ahead with plans to develop its own blood-pressure-lowering device, called a renal denervation system, for sale in the United States, Mahoney said in an interview. Renal denervation devices create tiny scars along nerves in the kidneys, which play a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure by sending signals to the brain that can cause blood vessels to constrict. The procedure currently is intended as an alternative to drug therapy for patients whose blood pressure is not well controlled by traditional medications. Boston Scientific will examine data from Medtronic’s halted study, in which the company’s device failed to prove effective, as it designs the U.S. clinical trial for its own product, Mahoney said. “Right now it’s going to be a slower market until BSC or another company delivers on a trial. When that happens, the market will open up, and it has the potential to be a multi-billion-dollar market,” he said. Medtronic had a jump start on the U.S. market in the development of a treatment, but the failure of its Symplicity device in the study, announced in January, caught many observers by surprise. Less than two weeks later, Covidien Plc said it would stop making its hypertension device, which was approved for sale in Europe in February 2012, due to weak demand. Mahoney said repercussions from Medtronic’s failed U.S. study will be felt in Europe, where cardiologists will be less inclined to recommend the treatment until more evidence of its effectiveness can be demonstrated in more clinical trials. Medtronic continues to sell its device there, and Boston Scientific in December launched its own offering. St. Jude Medical Inc is also rolling out a hypertension device in Europe. But Boston Scientific remains optimistic about the technology’s potential to help the millions of people struggling to control their blood pressure, Mahoney said. High blood pressure increases the risk for heart disease and stroke but often has no symptoms. “There’s clearly a huge patient unmet need,” he said. Mahoney said Boston Scientific’s device has features that differentiate it from Medtronic’s product, making it more consistent, faster to use and less painful for the patient. “We do feel the platform we have is a superior platform,” he said. Medtronic has said it will form an independent panel of medical experts to make recommendations on the future of its renal denervation product. Boston Scientific acquired its renal denervation system through the purchase of Vessix Vascular Inc in November 2012.",true,Health News

Block that kick. First of all, lawmakers signed off on in-state tuition for undocumented students in 2001--before Dewhurst became lieutenant governor--while the 2005 legislation cited by Patrick largely left the 2001 law intact while focusing on all students getting in-state tuition even if parents move out of state. The proposal regarding free health care for illegal immigrants didn’t launch a program for immigrants, which is what Patrick’s statement seems to suggest. Rather, local governing bodies were permitted to provide (or, it appears, resume providing) non-emergency services to residents regardless of immigration status, an action projected to improve outcomes and head off costly emergency care to which all residents were already entitled per federal law. The Senate proposal also envisioned patients sharing costs.",W. Gardner Selby,"Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst has presided over Texas Senate approval of numerous changes in law including, his Republican challenger says, proposals benefiting illegal immigrants. State Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, who faces Dewhurst in a primary runoff for the party’s lieutenant governor nomination, said in a TV ad posted online April 28, 2014, that under Dewhurst’s leadership, the ""Senate passed an expansion of in-state tuition and free health care to illegal immigrants."" A follow-up ad, posted online May 13, 2014, is more dramatic, saying Dewhurst ""gave illegal immigrants free Obama-style health care."" This claim by Patrick, who has hammered his intent to secure the Texas-Mexico border, misreads Senate actions. Let's plow the parts--on tuition, then health care--back to back. An ‘expansion of in-state tuition … to illegal immigrants’ Dewhurst assumed his gavel-wielding post in 2003. That was two years after lawmakers and Gov. Rick Perry agreed to make it possible for undocumented residents to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. Patrick, in a backup document for his tuition claim, said he was referring to a 2005 Senate-approved measure; his campaign manager, Logan Spence, sent us emails pointing out news stories and a University of Texas at Austin web page stating  the proposal ""expanded"" the benefits of the 2001 law permitting undocumented students to qualify for in-state tuition. Best we could tell, though, Senate Bill 1528, which was signed into law by Perry in 2005, simply preserved the 2001 law while otherwise making it possible for all students to qualify for in-state tuition even if their parents have moved out of state. Wondering if we missed something, we turned to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and the University of Texas. Dominic Chavez, a board staff spokesman, responded by emailing us a May 31, 2005, staff analysis of the final version of the 2005 proposal. The analysis states that international students (doubling as legal U.S. nonresidents) who had previously been accustomed to paying in-state tuition would be required to pay nonresident rates, at least temporarily, narrowing access for those students, Chavez told us. Those changes were then projected to save the state more than $2.8 million a year. More broadly, according to the analysis, the proposal defined terms such as tuition, mandatory fees and residency toward ensuring consistency in what institutions charged students. Finally, the analysis said, the measure would allow citizens and legal permanent residents to establish residency in the state on the same basis afforded students coming to Texas universities from abroad. This was described as simplifying the ""residency determination of students whose parents have recently moved out of state, while the student stayed behind and completed secondary education. At present, a student who has never lived anywhere but Texas becomes a nonresident if his or her parent moves out of state prior to the student’s enrollment in a public institution of higher education,"" the analysis said. Chavez, asked if the proposal expanded benefits for illegal immigrants, said that possibility wasn’t explored as lawmakers finished drafting the law. He said the agency has no data to gauge if the law delivered new benefits to undocumented students. Dewhurst campaign spokeswoman Eliza Vielma responded to our inquiry by pointing out an October 2013 ""overview"" document of the 2005 law issued by the coordinating board stating the law focused on tuition for U.S. citizens. The 2013 summary said: ""Prior to these amendments, many U.S. citizens were inadvertently prevented from attaining Texas residency status because of unanticipated circumstances. For example, students born and raised in Texas but whose parents moved out of state before they had enrolled in college were previously classified as nonresidents unless they had enrolled in college prior to their parents’ departure. Additionally,"" the agency wrote, ""students raised by grandparents or other family members who had never gone to court to acquire legal custody were considered residents of the state in which their parents lived. Current statutes allow students in both of these cases, and other similar circumstances, to qualify for Texas resident status."" The UT-Austin web page cited by Patrick as supporting his declaration about the 2005 law is vague, first describing the effect of the 2001 law enabling undocumented students to attain in-state tuition and then turning to the 2005 changes: ""In 2005, the Texas Legislature approved Senate Bill 1528, which expanded the benefits of House Bill 1403,"" the 2001 measure, the web page says. But UT's page doesn’t say how the changes widened benefits of the 2001 law. And when we followed up with UT, admissions official Deana Williams said by phone that any interpretation of the law as expanding any tuition benefit for undocumented residents would be incorrect. She said the legislation simply made it so any student--a U.S. citizen, legal resident or unauthorized resident--could pay in-state tuition even if their parents moved out of state. An ‘expansion of… free health care to illegal immigrants’ Patrick tied his claim that Dewhurst presided over Senate approval of an expansion of free health care to illegal immigrants to the Senate’s 2003 voice-vote passage of Senate Bill 309, which a May 5, 2003, Senate Journal entry summarized as ""providing health care services without regard to a person's immigration status."" The proposal said a city, county or public hospital ""may use money from  local sources to provide health care services to a person without regard to the person's immigration status and shall establish a cost-share system for persons receiving health care services."" At an April 2003 committee hearing on the proposal, authoring Sen. Mario Gallegos, D-Houston, said it permitted hospitals to draw on local revenue to provide preventive services to residents regardless of a patient’s immigration standing. Sylvia Garcia, then a Harris County commissioner, testified the proposal would hasten outpatient services, heading off health problems early and saving money thanks to fewer emergency-room visits. Proponents described the legislation as vital after the then-Texas attorney general, John Cornyn, issued an advisory opinion in July 2001 stating that unless lawmakers allowed the Harris County Hospital District (and others, presumably) to deliver preventive services to patients regardless of immigration status, the district couldn’t give such care without violating the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which required state legislatures to intervene if states wanted hospitals to go ahead and do so. Notably, Cornyn’s letter made it clear some health services already were provided patients regardless of immigration status--as mandated by federal law. Cornyn’s letter said the district was required by law to provide emergency care to residents regardless of their legal status. By email, spokesman Lance Lunsford of the Texas Hospital Association, which describes itself as the political and educational advocate for more than 430 hospitals and health systems statewide, told us a federal law from the 1980s, the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, made free emergency care available to illegal immigrants. According to a federal website, that act required Medicare-participating hospitals that offer emergency services to provide a medical exam when a request is made for an emergency condition, including active labor, regardless of an individual's ability to pay. Cornyn’s letter also said federal law permitted public health services including immunizations and testing and treatment of symptoms of communicable diseases. Still, he wrote, the 1996 law specified that any other state or local health benefit could be provided only if a state law ""affirmatively provides for such eligibility."" Mike Stafford, the Harris County attorney, reacted to Cornyn’s letter by advising the local hospital district to stop giving discounted preventive care because it violates federal law, according to a July 12, 2001, Associated Press news story. ""It's up to the Texas Legislature to step in now and, if they want to create an exception for this, it's allowable,"" Stafford said.. In 2003, SB 309 died in the House, though advocates including Lunsford said the permission to provide such services ended up in House Bill 2292, a major 2003 overhaul of health care agencies. Section 285.201 of the Texas Health and Safety code ""affirmatively establishes"" the eligibility of undocumented residents to receive non-emergency public health benefits funded locally by public hospital districts. And in the end, did the legislation expand free health care for illegal immigrants? When we inquired, King Hillier, a vice president of the Harris County Hospital District, said by phone that ""basically"" the district had already been providing non-emergency services when the issue reached lawmakers. Hillier stressed the permissive quality of the proposal; funding and delivery of services was left up to local governments. Finally, Hillier noted the Senate version of the law envisioned a system of patients sharing costs, which has resulted, he said. Our ruling Patrick said the Dewhurst-led Senate ""passed an expansion of in-state tuition and free health care to illegal immigrants."" Block that kick.

195,2683,Depressed? You must like chocolate.,"April 26, 2010","People who are depressed eat more chocolate than people who are not, U.S. researchers said on Monday, in a study that puts numbers behind the link between mood and chocolate.",Julie Steenhuysen,"Chocolates are pictured in Broc near Fribourg September 7, 2009. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse They said people who were depressed ate an average of 8.4 servings of chocolate per month, compared with 5.4 servings among those who were not. And people who had major depression based on results of a screening test ate even more — 11.8 servings per month. A serving was considered to be one small bar, or 1 ounce (28 grams), of chocolate. “Depressed mood was significantly related to higher chocolate consumption,” Dr. Natalie Rose of the University of California, Davis, and University of California, San Diego, and colleagues wrote in the Archives of Internal Medicine. Many people consider chocolate a mood-booster but few studies have actually confirmed the connection between the confection and mood. And most studies have looked only at women. Rose and colleagues studied the relationship between chocolate and mood among 931 women and men who were not using antidepressants. People in the study reported how much chocolate they consumed and most also completed a food frequency questionnaire about their overall diet. Their moods were assessed using a commonly used depression scale. What they found was a marked association between chocolate consumption and depression. And unlike other studies that looked only at women, the link was true of both men and women. What the study could not say was why people who are depressed eat more chocolate. It could be that depression stimulates chocolate cravings, and people eat chocolate as a sort of self treatment, confirming some studies on rats that suggest chocolate can improve mood, the authors said. Or, it could be that depression may stimulate chocolate cravings for some other reason without providing any mood benefit. People in the study did not have any such “treatment benefit” from chocolate, the team said. And they said it may be that eating a lot of chocolate actually causes people to feel depressed, another possible explanation for the association they saw in the study. It may be something physiological about chocolate, such as providing additional antioxidants. Or the mood-boosting effect of chocolate could be fleeting, like the temporary euphoria from drinking alcohol, leaving people feeling even lower after the brief euphoria has passed. “Distinguishing among these possibilities will require different study designs,” the team said. They said future studies will be needed to determine whether chocolate is a cause of depression, or a temporary salve.",true,Health News

In its guidelines to member states, the WHO said children between one and four years old should spend at least three hours in a variety of physical activities spread throughout the day. Infants under one should interact in floor-based play and avoid all screens, it said. Being inactive is fueling a rise in the numbers of obese or overweight people worldwide, the WHO said. Excessive weight can lead to premature death from heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and some forms of cancer. “Preventing these deaths needs to start in very early life,” Bull said. One in three adults today are overweight or obese, and one in four adults does not do enough physical activity, she said. “In this age group of under 5s, it is currently 40 million children around the world (who) are overweight. Of that (figure) 50 percent are in Africa and the southeast Asia region,” Bull said. That translates into 5.9 percent of children globally. Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development during which habits are formed and family lifestyle routines are adaptable, said the WHO guidelines, drawn from evidence in hundreds of studies, many from Australia, Canada, South Africa and the United States. “Sedentary behaviors, whether riding motorized transport rather than walking or cycling, sitting at a desk in school, watching TV or playing inactive screen-based games are increasingly prevalent and associated with poor health outcomes,” the WHO said. Chronic insufficient sleep in children has been associated with increased excessive fat accumulation as measured by body mass index (BMI), it said. Shorter sleep duration has been associated with more TV viewing and time spent playing computer games, it added.",true,Health News

With EU leaders due to meet next week to discuss the recovery plan, a group of 180 political decision-makers, business leaders, trade unions, campaign groups and think tanks urged the bloc to adopt green stimulus measures. “After the crisis, the time will come to rebuild,” they said in a letter. “The transition to a climate-neutral economy, the protection of biodiversity and the transformation of agri-food systems have the potential to rapidly deliver jobs, growth ... and to contribute to building more resilient societies.”  Signatories included ministers from 10 countries from Italy to Luxembourg, 79 EU lawmakers, and chief executives from L’Oreal’s (OREP.PA) Jean-Paul Agon to IKEA’s Jesper Brodin and Danone’s (DANO.PA) Emmanuel Faber. Calling fallout from the coronavirus pandemic a shock worse than the 2008 financial crisis, the signatories said rescue measures should advance the EU’s landmark Green Deal policy package, which aims to bring the 27-nation bloc to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Calls for a green EU recovery have grown louder in recent days, after European finance ministers on Thursday agreed support for their coronavirus-battered economies but left open the question of how to finance the bloc’s recovery. Ten EU countries, joined by Germany, France and Greece over the weekend, have signed a separate open letter urging the EU to ensure its rescue package supports the Green Deal. Poland and Czech Republic are among countries asking the EU to ease climate policies amid the pandemic. Some asset managers are also urging governments to design economic rescue packages to accelerate a low-carbon transition. “Investors are definitely becoming bolder at wanting to now pivot the debate on post-COVID rebuilding towards broader sustainability and resilience,” said Michael Hugman, portfolio manager at asset manager NinetyOne in London.

The truck originated in the Tamaulipas state capital of Ciudad Victoria bound for Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas; and it remains unseen if it belongs to a Cartel or how they acquired the vehicle if that were the case. There will be an ongoing investigation involving both United States Federal Agencies and Mexican authorities to determine whether anyone from inside either nation’s disaster programs was involved in the trafficking or even the theft of the vehicle.

REUTERS/FDA/Handout The “graphic health warnings,” unveiled on Wednesday, aim to depict the negative effects of smoking, and they will be required on all cigarette packages and advertisements as of October 2012. The FDA will accept comments on its proposed warnings until January 9. In June, the agency will choose nine graphic images from the 36 it has proposed. More prominent warnings on cigarette packages, including larger text labels, were mandated in a June 2009 law putting the multibillion-dollar tobacco industry under the control of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The proposal offers the most significant and important change in public health warnings since the release of the surgeon general’s landmark report on smoking in the 1960s, said Matt Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “These warnings are based on the best evidence about how to raise awareness and concern about the health effects of smoking with at-risk youth and smokers thinking about quitting,” Myers said. A 1964 surgeon general’s report concluded that smoking was linked to lung cancer and other diseases, spurring a broad anti-smoking campaign and new health warnings on cigarette packages. The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act called for cigarette packages to include new warning statements in large type covering half of the front and back of each package and graphic images showing adverse health effects from smoking. The warnings will also occupy the top 20 percent of every tobacco advertisement. “For the first time ever, they will say that tobacco products are addictive, and they will say in the bluntest of terms that tobacco can kill,” FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said. “We need to make sure that anyone who is considering smoking fully appreciates the consequences of cigarette use.”   But investors are skeptical that the warnings will have much impact on sales of cigarettes. Charles Norton, a portfolio manager with GNI Capital Inc, said similar efforts in other markets around the world have had little effect. “I think it will ultimately have very limited impact on consumption,” Norton said. Altria Group Inc’s Philip Morris unit, the largest U.S. cigarette maker, supported the overall bill, while some smaller rivals, such Reynolds American Inc’s R.J. Reynolds Tobacco unit and Lorillard Inc’s Lorillard Tobacco Co, opposed it. A spokesman for R.J. Reynolds declined to comment before reviewing the 140-page proposal, but noted that the company had challenged the legality of larger and graphic warnings in a pending federal lawsuit in the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.

204,9225,Saturated fat could be good for you,"December 8, 2016","A single, brief study from Norway claims to demonstrate that saturated fats are generally beneficial for most people, in contrast to much research that suggests potential heart risks are associated with higher saturated fat intake. The study of 38 men with abdominal obesity took place over a 12-week period and compared the effects of either a high carbohydrate or a high fat diet. This study, though randomized, only measured markers of risk such as blood pressure and triglycerides (not actual heart disease) for a short period of time. Current recommendations regarding fat intake are based on actual rates of heart disease found in large groups of people followed for years. It’s not unreasonable to raise questions about the role of saturated fat in heart disease. Researchers readily acknowledge that existing studies on the issue have important limitations. However, this release goes too far in describing the significance of this single small study, and gives no acknowledgment to evidence that cuts the other way. The release also lacks information expected of a solid account of a new nutrition study — such as a measurable benefit, harms, and details of the diet’s contents. Substantial claims require substantial evidence. This release claims to present data that upends the conventional wisdom on dietary fat, but it doesn’t acknowledge that the study has important limitations. Nor does it acknowledge the many other studies that have addressed the same questions examined by this research. People are already confused enough about what they should be eating. The last thing they need are sweeping claims, like “Saturated fat could be good for you,” that aren’t backed up by definitive evidence.","Sally James,Kathleen Fairfield, MD, DrPH,Kathlyn Stone","The release does not mention costs but we won’t fault it for this. We rate this Not Applicable since it would be very difficult to estimate the cost of shifting eating patterns that incorporate more foods laden with saturated fats. The release did not use many numbers to quantify the benefits of consuming one diet over another. For example, it states: “In the randomized controlled trial, 38 men with abdominal obesity followed a dietary pattern high in either carbohydrates or fat, of which about half was saturated. Fat mass in the abdominal region, liver and heart was measured with accurate analyses, along with a number of key risk factors for cardiovascular disease. “The very high intake of total and saturated fat did not increase the calculated risk of cardiovascular diseases,” says professor and cardiologist Ottar Nygård who contributed to the study.” The italicized words reflect where some quantification would have helped the release. What does “high” refer to? Which measuring tools were used to assess fat mass in the abdomen, liver and heart? The release did not go into any detail on the potential downsides of a very-high-saturated fat diet. For example: Would most people enjoy and be able to adhere to a diet that includes lots of butter, cream, and cold-pressed oils? Some would no doubt savor such a diet, but others might be turned off. This release doesn’t caution that this small study only lasted for 12 weeks and looked only at markers of risk. The results are presented as being much more definitive than they are. The release does not engage in disease mongering. The release does not list funding sources or provide any statement regarding potential conflicts for the principal investigators. The release is about comparing two diets — one high in “lowly” processed fats (butter, cream and cold-pressed oils) and another high in carbohydrates. The release does not give us details of the diets (what to consume and how much) so it’s almost impossible to compare them. Both high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods are widely available. The release does not establish any novelty for this research. There are a number of studies looking at cardiometabolic markers in response to higher fat diets. Unjustifiable language is present in the release, beginning with the headline —  “Saturated fat could be good for you.” This tiny study provides little if any evidence for that claim, and the statement contradicts substantial amounts of conflicting research. Moreover, the release later says that a high saturated fat diet “did not increase the calculated risk of cardiovascular diseases” — it doesn’t say that it “lowered” risk. So it seems that the best one could conclude, even in a generous interpretation, is that “saturated fat might not be bad for you.”",false,"saturated fats,University of Bergen"

","January 4, 2016",Cabela's Takes a Stand on Medical Excise Tax on Sporting Goods,  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"Obamacare’s medical excise tax doesn’t apply to sporting goods, and Cabela’s isn’t applying it to transactions there. The rumor started with a social media post that showed a Cabela’s receipt with a $5.82 charge for what’s identified as a “medical excise tax” back in 2013. According to the post, the 2.3% medical excise tax was supposed to be “hidden” from customers, but Cabela’s had taken a stand by including the charge as a separate line item on receipts. But Obamacare’s medical excise tax does not apply to sporting goods. Cabela’s mistakenly included the surcharge on customer receipts for one day — January 1, 2013 — and issued refunds to customers within a week. Joe Arterburn, a Cabela’s spokesperson, said that the 2.3% medical excise tax was applied to customer transactions because of a “glitch in the system.” Aterburn said the mistake came to light when customers notified the company that the medical excise tax surcharge had appeared on their sales receipts. The medical excise tax was established under Obamacare to help supplement the cost of providing insurance to the uninsured. Medical professionals pay the excise tax when they purchase medical devices defined under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA): Medical devices range from simple tongue depressors and bedpans to complex programmable pacemakers with micro-chip technology and laser surgical devices. In addition, medical devices include in vitro diagnostic products, such as general purpose lab equipment, reagents, and test kits, which may include monoclonal antibody technology. Certain electronic radiation emitting products with medical application and claims meet the definition of medical device. Examples include diagnostic ultrasound products, x-ray machines and medical lasers. If a product is labeled, promoted or used in a manner that meets the following definition in section 201(h) of the Federal Food Drug & Cosmetic (FD&C) Act it will be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)as a medical device and is subject to premarketing and postmarketing regulatory controls. So, the medical excise tax does not apply to sporting goods, and consumers do not directly pay it. There are excise taxes on sporting goods, but they aren’t new and they weren’t established under the Affordable Care Act. These pre-existing taxes on manufacturers for things like fishing poles, tackle boxes, outboard motors and bows are defined under IRS Publication 510, which is not the same as the medical excise tax.

In the filing, a former coworker accused DePetro of allegedly making sexual advances to her, showing her images of women that he said he was attracted to, and ultimately asking her if she would engage in group sex with him. DePetro has denied the allegations. (WPRO officials were also named in the suit. DePetro's supervisor was accused of not properly acting against the alleged infractions. However, there is no record in Superior Court that, in the 15 months since the suit was filed, any of the defendants have been officially notified that they're being sued.) We called Maureen Martin, chairwoman of For Our Daughters RI, to ask about the sexual-assault allegation. Martin is also political activities director of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals, a labor union. Martin confirmed that the allegation in the petition referred to the 2012 sexual harassment suit. She asked to get back to us. By that night, the petition had been altered. The year had been changed to 2012. As of 2 p.m. Friday, the total was 6,671. However, the allegation of sexual assault was not modified. In a statement emailed that evening, Martin said that in the harassment complaint, DePetro's accuser ""alleges that Mr. DePetro made multiple 'sexual advances' toward her. These advances were unwelcome and 'inappropriate,' the complaint contends."" ""The United States Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women defines sexual assault, in part, as: 'any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient,'"" Martin said. ""We believe the alleged, unwelcome 'sexual advances' referenced in the aforementioned court filing fall under the classification of 'behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient.'"" We checked the Justice Department's definition. The other half of the definition, which Martin did not quote, says: ""Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape."" Sexual harassment is not mentioned. Our ruling For Our Daughters RI, in its petition calling for the removal of talk-radio host John DePetro, said, ""Earlier this year, he was accused of sexually assaulting a female co-worker."" DePetro was accused of sexual harassment in a lawsuit filed in 2012, not 2013. The suit, which has laid dormant according to court records, never alleges sexual assault. Both sexual harassment and sexual assault are serious allegations. But the former is a civil matter and the latter can send you to prison, and relegate an ex-convict to a life of a registered sex offender. We would expect a group devoted to protecting women to know the difference. Yet For Our Daughters RI is standing by its allegation, selectively quoting from a federal definition of sexual assault and neglecting the fact that the definition does not include sexual harassment. We rate its statement ! (With research by Providence Journal reporter Katie Mulvaney.

211,623,WHO hails 'triumph' as Merck's Ebola vaccine gets European green light.,"March 17, 2015",The world’s first Ebola vaccine was recommended for approval by European drugs regulators on Friday in a move hailed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a “triumph for public health” that would save many lives.,Kate Kelland,"The vaccine, developed by U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co, is already being used under emergency guidelines to try to protect people against the spread of a deadly Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo. It protects against the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus - the one that most commonly causes outbreaks. The shot is also being reviewed under a fast-track system by regulators in the United States, with a decision expected in the first quarter of next year. “This vaccine has already saved many lives in the current Ebola outbreak, and the decision by European regulators will help it to eventually save many more,” the WHO’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. The Congo Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,100 people since the middle of last year. It is the second-largest Ebola outbreak in history, after a 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,300. The Merck vaccine, which the company has now brand-named Ervebo, is likely to get a full marketing license from the European Commission in a few weeks. Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said the company’s priority now was to get regulatory approval of its Ervebo manufacturing site in Germany so that licensed supply of the vaccine “can be used to support global public health preparedness”. Merck’s vaccine is being used in Congo in a so-called “ring vaccination” approach, in which people who may have been in contact with someone newly infected with Ebola are traced and offered the shot to protect them. Charlie Weller, head of vaccines at the Wellcome Trust global heath charity said the Merck shot had already saved “countless lives” in the country. “Having this vaccine available under research conditions has been key in preventing the ongoing outbreak in the DRC spiraling into a repeat of the 2014-16 epidemic, where 11,000 people died,” she told Reuters. Health authorities in Kinshasa said last week they planned to introduce an experimental second Ebola vaccine, developed by  drugmaker Johnson & Johnson, in the country’s eastern provinces in November. The Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever and spreads from person to person through direct contact with body fluids. It kills around half of those it infects. There are currently no licensed treatments for the deadly infection, but scientists said in August they were a step closer to being able to cure it after two experimental drugs showed survival rates of as much as 90% in a clinical trial in Congo.",true,Health News
213,1943,"After Fukushima, mother fights to get her life back.","September 12, 2011","Even before the March 11 earthquake and tsunami struck knocking out the Fukushima nuclear plant, Aya’s life was a struggle.",Antoni Slodkowski,"She had divorced her abusive husband and was left on her own to care and provide for her two daughters. Now, six months after she fled her home just 9 km (6 miles) away from the radiation-spewing plant, the 26-year old single mother is barely surviving. She has no job, languishes in hiding from her violent ex-husband in temporary housing and will probably never see her home again. “It feels like a hole has opened inside me. My home was so important to me and I felt safe there,” said Aya who would not give her family name or disclose her exact location out of fear her ex-husband could find her. “It’s like time has just stopped. Ever since March 11, the time has stopped for me.”   The tsunami left 20,000 dead or missing, set off the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl a quarter of a century ago and forced 80,000 to evacuate. It hit particularly hard those who were already down on their luck. There were reports of lone deaths in temporary housing and suicide rates jumped in the quake-battered regions. After the disaster Aya was evacuated to a nearby gymnasium, but could not stay there as Noa - her younger four-year-old daughter - cannot walk because of a split spine and needs special care. The older, six-year-old Kurea has no disabilities and goes to school. “Noa’s father then called and we went to Saitama (north of Tokyo). He said the hospitals were up and running there, so I decided to do it for Noa’s sake,” says Aya as she puts braces around her younger daughter’s legs as they prepare for a trip to the kindergarten. “He soon started beating us up. It was so insane, I just had to flee again. Ignoring the risk of radiation I came back up to Fukushima prefecture,” says Aya, zipping her daughter’s backpack. She now lives in a modest apartment in one of the prefecture’s bigger cities sharing the fate of the tens of thousands that six months after the disaster still do not have a permanent home. About 10,000 still live in evacuation shelters, 34,000 stay in hotels or with relatives or friends and 40,000 live in temporary housing. “I also lost my job as an insurance agent as my company moved to a different town,” says Aya. With her daughter in kindergarten, she goes job hunting and says any job that would let her check on Noa from time to time will do. Landing a job is tough, though, as the influx of evacuees from the tsunami-hit areas doubled the number of job-seekers in the Fukushima prefecture. Like other evacuees, she blames the government for dragging its feet on mapping out the area’s future. Only last week, Tokyo said it would aim to halve radiation over two years in places contaminated by the nuclear disaster, removing soil, plants and trees in an area spanning thousands of square km. But it is not clear when, if ever, the evacuees will be able to return home. “I want them to come out into the open and to say it clearly: you will or will not be able to go back to your place. If not, I want them to tell me what am I, and thousands of other people, supposed to do,” says Aya in a trembling voice. “I have to wonder if I’ll be able to build my life here. I just can’t even begin to think about what to do in the future.”",true,Health News
221,10642,UAB Recruiting for Clinical Trial to Determine Therapies for Eradication of Multiple Myeloma –University of Alabama at Birmingham,"May 18, 2018","This news release about a test of combination drug therapy in people newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma blood cancer slathers on hopes and promises, while neglecting caveats, potential harms and essential context. The release neglects to point out that even after this phase 2 trial has been completed, researchers won’t know if the experimental drug cocktail is better or worse than standard treatments, because it does not include any direct comparison. The release puffs up the threat of multiple myeloma, which accounts for less than 2 percent of cancer cases in the US. It does not explain that patients would be responsible for many of the costs of this treatment, in part because of overlaps with standard care. The release does report support from pharmaceutical companies that make two of the drugs to be used. The lead investigator of this trial, Luciano Costa, MD, gave an interview in which he clearly pointed out much of the important information that is missing from the news release. The interview shows that the researchers are aware of the limitations of the evidence and of their trial. Costa pointed out that patients considering enrolling would be responsible for a share of the costs of treatment. Researchers have a responsibility to ensure that news releases issued about their work give readers a fair summary, not the kind of rosy depiction in this release. It’s also important to point out that this is a phase 2 trial, which identifies safety and effectiveness of a treatment. The primary endpoint is a surrogate that is not clearly associated with overall survival for this disease.","Andrew Holtz, MPH,Andrae Vandross, MD,Kathlyn Stone","In some experiments, it may be too early to discuss treatment costs, but this trial involves drugs that are all already approved for other uses, which means their prices are known. Also, while trial participants typically are not charged for experimental drugs, in this case it appears they will be billed for many treatment costs… and there would likely be costs for some (including travel and  lodging) that insurance would not cover. In fact, the lead investigator acknowledged the costs when asked in an interview about what patients should know about the trial: “[T]he study, like any other clinical trials, that our components are considered standard of care and they are charged to the patient or to the insurance. For example, the costs of seeing the doctor, the cost of doing the main test for a traditional disease assessment, the cost of stem cell transplant, but there are components that are considered experimental and are covered by the study, in this case, the daratumumab, the carfilzomib and the MRD testing by itself.” The release should have also noted these costs. By definition, the benefits of an experimental treatment are unknown. The release should not dangle the potential of unproven benefits, including eradicating multiple myeloma, without acknowledging that this experimental treatment may turn out to be no better, or even less beneficial, than standard treatments. In the interview mentioned above, the lead investigator noted, “There is no proof that a new therapy is better, otherwise would be no need for the clinical trial.” The release should have included that fundamental caveat. We think it’s important to stress that a trial to determine the best therapy would ideally compare  National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommended treatments such as revlimid, dexamethasone and velcade with a proposed therapy. There is no mention of risks or harms of the experimental approach, but part of the function of a phase 2 trial is to evaluate harms. Not only does each drug in the experimental cocktail include its own risks (including increased risk of heart attack and stroke, nerve damage, blood clots, low white blood cell and platelet counts, fatal spikes in blood pressure), but the effect of the combination of drugs could exacerbate the harms or even create new ones. While multiple myeloma patients may be aware of and acknowledge the risks of individual drugs as part of standard treatment, the unknowns of the experimental drug combination should have been pointed out in the release. Although the news release notes that this is a phase 2 clinical trial, it should have pointed out that because the trial does not directly compare the experimental treatment to standard care, another (phase 3) trial will be needed to test whether the experimental approach is better (or worse) than standard care. The release cites an accurate number of new multiple myeloma cases (more than 25,000/year), but the lead phrase “Multiple myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer in the United States” creates an exaggerated impression. The American Cancer Society calls multiple myeloma “a relatively uncommon cancer.” The ACS estimates it accounts for about 2 percent of all cancer cases and deaths. The release reports that this trial is supported by Amgen and Janssen, makers of two of the drugs it uses. (Executives at Janssen may not be happy that the release misspelled the company’s name as “Janseen”.) The disclosure would have been more complete if it had noted that the lead investigator, Luciano Costa, MD, PhD, has also received speaking fees and other personal payments from Amgen and Celgene (which sells another one of the drugs being tested). The release repeatedly touts the promise that this experimental therapy will prove to be superior to standard treatments, without clearly stating that even after this trial is done the answer to that fundamental question won’t be known, because there is no direct comparison. What’s more, the release highlights problems with and risks of standard care, even as it neglects the potential risks of the experimental treatment. The release notes that the trial uses drugs that are already available, though some are approved for only patients who have relapsed after initial treatment. It makes clear that the “minimal residual disease” testing regime to be used is not routinely available. Most readers of this release will get the impression that this trial is unique, when actually several groups are testing the same drug combination. The release highlights the researchers’ plan to use “next generation sequencing technology to detect minimal residual disease” (MRD) and to use those MRD results to guide treatment. There is much discussion of using MRD to monitor response to therapy but it is certainly not ready for widespread use. Some of the other similar trials also track minimal residual disease, though a quick review of trial descriptions on www.ClinicalTrials.gov does not make clear whether this trial is unique in using the MRD test results to guide treatment decisions or whether this feature is important. Similar trials include: A Study of Daratumumab in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Daratumumab, Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide and Low Dose Dexamethasone (DKRd) in Newly Diagnosed, Multiple Myeloma Selinexor and Backbone Treatments of Multiple Myeloma Patients Aggressive Smoldering Curative Approach Evaluating Novel Therapies and Transplant 2015-12: A Study Exploring the Use of Early and Late Consolidation/Maintenance Therapy A quote from the lead investigator captures how this release dangles promises that go well beyond the evidence: “I believe for the first time that we have treatments that are effective enough to make it possible to eradicate multiple myeloma definitively in a substantial proportion of patients, along with having the technology to detect that the disease has been targeted and that treatment can be stopped,” said Luciano Costa, M.D., Ph.D. In the interview noted above, Costa was careful to note that there is no proof this approach is better than existing treatments. The release should have highlighted similar basic caveats.",false,"Cancer,University news release"
224,78,China's tobacco monopoly means big risks for e-cigarette startups.,"December 2, 2016","In a glass-walled laboratory, chemists puff on vaping devices as they test liquid nicotine flavors. Nearby, staffers with cartons of instant noodles on their desks tap away at laptops, messaging suppliers and customers.",Josh Horwitz,"Here at the Shenzhen offices of e-cigarette start-up RELX Technology, workers scramble to keep pace with the rush of firms vying for sales in the world’s biggest tobacco market. Their potential-customer base starts with 300 million Chinese smokers of traditional cigarettes – about nine times the number in the United States. Founded by former employees of Didi Chuxing, China’s answer to Uber, RELX aims to become China’s answer to Juul Labs Inc, the San Francisco startup that captured a huge share of the U.S. vaping market with a sleek and addictive e-cigarette. RELX makes an almost identical product: a stick-shaped device that burns high-nicotine liquids packaged in plug-in “pods.” But it won’t have to compete with the U.S. e-cigarette giant. Juul has yet to crack China’s market even as it aggressively expands elsewhere in Asia and faces a regulatory crisis in the United States here over a surge in youth vaping. Juul’s delayed entry into China – potentially its most lucrative market – underscores the complexity and risk of operating here. E-cigarette sales have grown slowly in China compared to other industrialized nations. Its market is about one-ninth the size of the United States, according to market research firm Euromonitor. One main reason: China Tobacco, which is both the government-owned cigarette company and the national tobacco regulator. The state monopoly has not clearly signaled how it will regulate e-cigarettes – or whether it will sell them. If it does, it has the power to regulate its competitors out of the business. One investor in a Chinese e-cigarette startup likened the combined regulatory and competitive threat to “a knife on the neck.”  China Tobacco did not respond to written questions from Reuters. The cigarette giant’s power stems in part from its contribution to the national purse - accounting for 5.45% of China’s tax revenue in 2018. That amounts to 10.8 trillion yuan ($1.5 trillion), according to calculations by Professor Rose Zheng of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. Still, China Tobacco sells cigarettes for a fraction of what they cost in most nations – as little as 3 yuan per pack, or less than half a U.S. dollar. RELX sells a device and one pod for between 299 yuan to 399 yuan. Foreign firms, particularly U.S. firms, face the additional obstacles of the U.S.-China trade war, cultural challenges in marketing and distributing, and competition from a host of new Chinese e-cigarette startups including RELX, which was valued at $2.4 billion based on recent investments. In September, Juul briefly started selling devices on two popular online commerce sites, Tmall and JD.com Inc. But the products were pulled from the websites days later for unknown reasons. Juul, Tmall parent company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, and JD.com declined to comment on the Juul product removals or China’s regulatory environment. China Tobacco issued a notice Nov. 1 urging e-commerce platforms and e-cigarette companies to shut online stores offering vaping products, a move aimed at stopping youth sales. Juul declined to comment on its China strategy. RELX CEO Kate Wang said she’s “not worried” about the government’s impact on the sector. The products will continue to remain available, she said, “as long as there’s proof that this is a good solution for smokers.”  Many e-cigarette startups still see boundless opportunity in China. Nearly half of Chinese men smoke cigarettes, according to the World Health Organization. Chinese factories make 95% of the world’s e-cigarettes, according to Electronic Cigarette Industry Committee, a Chinese trade association. But almost all of that production is exported. Juul’s explosive U.S. growth only recently convinced Chinese e-cigarette firms of the viability of small, high-nicotine vaping devices in China. They had focused on larger, box-shaped devices that spew vast clouds of vapor and spawned a subculture in the Chinese hip-hop community. The box vapes were less effective in delivering nicotine but offered better profit margins, said Michael Gao, founder of Chinese e-cigarette company Moti. “The old box-style models, you could sell for $100,” compared to about $30 for a Juul-like device, Gao said. “So everyone had doubts about the pod model.”  Juul’s success quelled those doubts. Dozens of Chinese startups released pod-style vapes starting in 2018. Many had roots in China’s technology industry. Shenzhen-based Laan, for instance, was founded by former employees at WeChat, the messaging app owned by Tencent. YOOZ, based in Beijing, was launched by Cai Yuedong, an online media entrepreneur. Samuel Liu, who launched the Evove brand of e-cigarettes, envisions a mass market. “It’s a legal drug; it’s a fast-moving consumer good; and it’s an electronic product,” he said. “Electronic cigarettes will be the second item you carry in your pocket, after your phone.”   And yet Liu and others acknowledge the risk posed by China Tobacco. “When VC’s come to me, I always tell them they shouldn’t get too excited,” he said. “You don’t know when the government will come in and just claim this market for itself.”  Some VCs are embracing the risk. In April, RELX closed on $75 million in venture capital funding from high-profile investors including Sequoia China and Yuri Milner. In addition to e-commerce sites, RELX sells its products through bars, cafes and smartphone repair shops, and says it has more than 900 branded storefronts as franchise partners. The company also plans to soon open flagship stores in Southeast Asia and London. The company’s most popular flavors are mung bean, a common ingredient in Chinese desserts, and laobinggun, a type of popsicle popular in the nineties in China. “We search for flavors that are pretty familiar to people over 30, things that are old-fashioned and inspire emotion,” says Wang. China Tobacco dominates the nation’s tobacco supply from manufacturing to retailing. The same entity controls regulation under a different name – the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration. The administration has at times worked against efforts to limit smoking. In Hangzhou, for example, the local government in 2018 attempted to ban indoor public smoking. The movement lost momentum after the tobacco administration pushed for lighter measures including more designated smoking areas, which it said allowed for “civilized smoking” in a statement to Reuters at the time. In May 2017, the regulator claimed jurisdiction over heat-not-burn smoking devices - an alternative type of e-cigarette that creates a vapor from raw tobacco leaves. The decision effectively barred Phillip Morris International Inc from Chinese sales of its IQOS device, a heat-not-burn e-cigarette popular in Japan. China Tobacco subsidiaries have since begun testing their own heat-not-burn devices and selling them in limited quantities. Phillip Morris said in a statement it had no current plans to sell IQOS in China but did not comment on the nation’s regulation of the heat-not-burn sector. The government has sent conflicting messages on whether it intends to regulate e-cigarettes that vaporize liquid nicotine blends - or sell them itself. In March, state broadcaster CCTV aired a segment highlighting the potential health risks from inhaling nicotine and other chemicals in e-cigarette liquids. The spot was part of a program - broadcast annually on China’s national “Consumer Day” - that targets industries the government alleges have wronged the public. Industry players say they struggled to interpret the government’s message in the segment. They hoped it signaled that the tobacco monopoly would continue allowing e-cigarette sales but start regulating their quality and safety. They had the same hopes in May, when a government regulator submitted draft regulations for exported Chinese e-cigarettes to the World Trade Organization. Many industry observers, however, continue to believe China Tobacco will eventually enter the e-cigarette market itself. State-owned enterprises such as China Tobacco are “bloated and slow to take action,” said Maggie Chen of ESun, a Shenzhen-based consulting firm that helps companies comply with import and export regulations. “But they are definitely paying attention to this sector.”",true,Health News
226,7702,"In Chilean desert, global thirst for lithium is fueling a 'water war'.","August 29, 2018","On Chilean water regulator Oscar Cristi’s desk, a small white espresso cup teeters atop piles of documents and loose folders that appear on the point of collapse, perhaps an apt metaphor for the growing water crisis in parts of the Andean country.",Dave Sherwood,"Sitting in his eighth-floor office adjacent to the presidential palace, Cristi, a PhD economist, lays out a map of Chile showing key watersheds for mining. Swaths of the mineral-rich north are colored blue, denoting areas where aquifers are over-exploited. Soon, if Cristi gets his way, they will be red, meaning new water rights will be banned. Reams of water rights were granted by Chilean governments over decades with little consideration for their cumulative impact as miners scrambled to stake claims on the small pockets of water available in the salt flats of the Salar de Atacama. The Salar sits in the world’s driest desert. The water trapped beneath the salt pan feeds the world’s biggest copper mine and holds in suspension more than one-third of the world’s current supply of lithium, the ultra-light metal used in electric car batteries, mobile phones and lap-tops. With demand for water growing in a region economically vital to the country, Cristi is now taking steps to rein in usage. But there is a problem. No one really knows how much water is there. Cristi said Chilean development agency Corfo, which helps oversee lithium extraction in the Salar, hopes to provide a better picture in a study due in December. “The state has been very reluctant to draw up bans on water extraction,” said Cristi, who was only recently appointed head of the water authority. “We want to take much more diligent approach in decreeing prohibited areas.”  Cristi did not say why past governments had been hesitant to declare bans. In Chile, threats of a government crackdown on over-usage of water often ring hollow. Mines need water, and the country´s copper-driven economy needs mines. A sweeping overhaul of Chile’s dictatorship-era water code proposed in 2014 has languished in Congress, slowed by intense lobbying by industry. Now though, the mining industry is paying close attention to  Cristi. Earlier this month his agency imposed a rare ban on new permits to extract water from an aquifer that is a critical water supply for BHP´s Escondida, the world´s largest copper mine. The agency is also preparing to create a drinking water reserve nearer the operations of top lithium producers SQM and Albemarle that would allow the government to further restrict water use there. SQM and Albemarle say they have all the water rights they need and do not expect new restrictions to impact their current or future production of lithium. A global boom in demand for lithium has set off a scramble in Chile, which is home to nearly 50 percent of the world’s reserves of the metal. Local indigenous groups, SQM and Albemarle, regional copper miners and newcomers to the region are all competing for water. “What we have is a water war in the salt pan. There’s a huge crush on water and nowhere to get it from,” said Alonso Barros, an attorney with the Atacama Desert Foundation, an NGO that works with indigenous groups in the region. SQM and Albemarle both recently signed deals with the government to sharply increase their quotas for extracting lithium from the Salar, although they say they will not use any more water than they have already been granted. Newcomers like Wealth Minerals, New Energy Metals, and Lithium Chile have also announced projects in the salt flats. Wealth Minerals, New Energy Metals and Lithium Chile did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On a computer screen, Cristi scrolls through a spreadsheet showing row upon row of water rights granted decades ago in the southernmost sector of the Salar - totaling six times more than the government now believes available - with little more than each company’s own data to support their sustainability. Past governments did not adequately map how much water is available, says Cristi. Now monitoring wells are being installed in some areas, but base line data is still lacking. “Our (understanding) continues to be limited now, but back then, it was very limited,” he said. The cumulative impact of water rights granted over the years to copper and lithium miners in the world’s most arid desert has never been considered, according to Ingrid Garces, a professor who studies salt flats at Chile’s University of Antofagasta. “We’re managing lithium as though it were a type of hard-rock mining,” said Garces. “But we’re mining water, not rock. This is a watershed.”   Take too much water from one place, she says, and it may impact another, comparing it to sucking water from a glass with a syringe. “Even if you’re drawing from just one area, the whole is still reduced,” she said. Sorting out the water crisis at Atacama is complicated by a lack of data, but also a jurisdiction issue. The brine from which miners extract lithium is water, but in Chile, it is regulated as a mineral like copper or iron. Environmental regulators handle permits for brine, while the water authority permits freshwater pumping. A lack of communication between the two, combined with a lack of understanding about how freshwater and brine interact beneath the Salar, has left authorities hamstrung, says Cristi. “There may be an imbalance that we’re not accounting for,” he said.

230,8211,"In Nagoya, scramble for hospital beds shows coronavirus challenge for aging Japan.","March 16, 2020","Hospitals in Nagoya city in Japan’s industrial heartland have more coronavirus patients than they can treat, forcing transfers to nearby areas and offering a glimpse of the challenges the outbreak poses for a country with a huge elderly population.","Linda Sieg, Rocky Swift","Japan has closed schools and canceled public events, which experts say has helped prevent an explosive spread of the virus. But because testing hasn’t been widespread, some medical experts say the extent of infection is understated, and a surge could yet happen. That would put more of the country under the strain now being felt in Nagoya, and force a nationwide scramble to shift patients, many of them elderly, to hospitals in areas with capacity. “If the numbers rise further, we won’t be able to cope, so we will either have to ask nearby prefectures to help, or tell those with lighter symptoms to stay at home,” a prefecture  official in Nagoya told Reuters. Confirmed coronavirus cases in Nagoya, the capital of Aichi prefecture, totaled 98 as of Sunday, the official said, far exceeding the city’s 27 beds at hospitals that meet conditions for patients with the highly contagious disease. Aichi, home to Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), is Japan’s second-hardest hit prefecture, with 121 confirmed coronavirus cases so far. It has a total of 161 beds capable of handling patients with such a disease. Of those, 105 were in use as of Sunday, the official said. Elderly people are especially vulnerable to serious effects the virus. Japan has the world’s oldest population, with more than 28% aged 65 or over. Italy, which has Europe’s oldest population, is facing growing concerns about the ability of its strained health system to cope with a relentless increase in new cases. “If we allow the epidemic to continue, it’s a matter of time,” said Hokkaido University professor Hiroshi Nishiura when asked if Japan could face a situation similar to Italy’s. He added that the trajectory of the epidemic was hard to predict. Japan has been hospitalizing all patients who test positive for the virus, even if symptoms are slight, in line with its law on infectious diseases. But now, in some areas, patients with lighter symptoms are being asked to isolate at home. To free up more hospital beds, patients with non-urgent surgery will likely be asked to wait, and others may be discharged earlier than is usual in Japan, experts said. Hospitals are being asked to prepare plans for transferring patients to places that can treat them, given how the speed of the spread has varied by region, said Takuma Kato, a health ministry official. Japan’s health ministry has issued guidelines on handling an influx of coronavirus patients based on estimates of what peak numbers might look like. “Potentially, there will be a surge of new cases if Japan is not successful in containment, which I think will happen,” said  Kenji Shibuya, director of the Institute of Population Health, King’s College, London. “Japan is not yet at the level of what Italy is experiencing in terms of outbreak phase, but that gives us a very important lesson - we have to be prepared,” he said. The death toll in Italy rose to 1,809 by Sunday after a 25% jump in just 24 hours. The number of cases hit 24,747. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said there were 12,000 beds nationwide that could take serious virus cases and 3,000 respirators, but Shibuya said that didn’t mean there were trained medical staff to handle all of those cases. A national action plan based on a 2012 law calls for hospitalizing severe cases and treating mild cases at home. Parliament on Friday revised that law to allow the government to declare a state of emergency to cover the coronavirus. Abe has said conditions didn’t warrant such a declaration yet. A shortage of cutting-edge equipment to treat the most severe cases also poses a risk, and could force tough decisions about whom to treat if cases rise fast, as in Italy.

The death toll could have been much greater if not for the massive evacuation in the days before the storm made landfall, officials said. The seaside temple town of Puri, which lay directly in the path of Fani, suffered extensive damage as winds gusting up to 200 kph (124 mph) tore off tin roofs, snapped power lines, and uprooted trees on Friday. “The cyclone has killed 21 people in Puri and about 300 people are injured,” Brajabandhu Dash, medical officer at Puri, told Reuters. Earlier, 12 deaths were reported from other parts of the state. The depression over the Western Meghalaya and adjoining Bangladesh has weakened, and will become insignificant in the next 24 hours, India’s met department said on Twitter early on Sunday. According to preliminary reports, Fani damaged power infrastructure worth more than 12 billion rupees ($173.7 million) and the authorities are trying to restore electricity supply for emergency services, another official said. More than 60,000 people including officials and volunteers were involved in relief operations, said special relief commissioner Bishnupada Sethi, who monitored the evacuation. The relief effort used sirens, loudspeakers and sent more than 20 million mobile messages to the targeted people, he said. The cyclone season in the Bay of Bengal can last from April to December, and storms can be deadly. In 1999, a super-cyclone battered the coast of Odisha for 30 hours, killing 10,000 people. Fani was the strongest summer cyclone in 43 years to hit Odisha, disrupting water supplies and transport links, the state’s chief minister Naveen Patnaik said in a statement. “We are in the process of restoring physical infrastructure,” he told reporters. Relief agencies were trying to provide food and medicine to victims in other parts of the state, while hundreds of thousands were still not accessible due to roadblocks and disruption in the communication network, officials said. The town of Puri was littered with tree branches, the debris of damaged houses and broken glass. Relief teams were trying to clear the roads. “There was no wind at night (before landfall). We thought nothing will happen,” P. Chittmma, 45, told Reuters while laying on a bed at a government hospital, showing her fractured leg.",true,Environment

House Speaker Mike Turzai argued that children are largely protected from the ravages of the coronavirus because of their youth and would be safe if they return to school in the fall. A new study published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics found that roughly one in five children with serious cases of coronavirus had no underlying medical conditions. In New York City, 52 children sickened with the coronavirus have developed a serious condition called pediatric multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome.",Jessica Calefati,"Arguing that Pennsylvania should move quickly to reopen its economy even as coronavirus cases surge in some areas, the state House’s Republican leader said this weekend that reopening schools in the fall should be a top priority. Not only do students deserve a chance to perform experiments in science labs and play instruments in recitals, House Speaker Mike Turzai said children are largely protected from the ravages of the virus because of their youth and would be safe if they go back to school. ""Guess what, they’re not at risk unless they have an underlying medical issue,"" said Turzai, whose comments came in a video he recorded from his Allegheny County home and later shared on social media. We wondered whether school-age children are as safe as the house speaker says. Turzai was on the right track when he said that children in poor health who contract the coronavirus are at risk of becoming seriously ill. And it’s true that children are far less susceptible than adults. But his claim that other children are totally safe is incorrect, according to a study published recently in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics. Turzai declined to provide any evidence he relied on when he made this claim. Testifying before the Senate this week, Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease doctor, warned Americans not to be ""cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects."" The study followed 48 children and young adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in the U.S. and Canada in March and April. Roughly one out of every five children studied had no underlying conditions. The others suffered from immune suppression, obesity, diabetes, seizures, or chronic lung disease. In some cases, the impact of the virus was devastating. The Rutgers University researchers who authored the study found that more than 20% of children experienced failure of two or more organ systems and almost 40% required a breathing tube and ventilator. At the end of the study period, a third of the children the researchers tracked were still hospitalized. Two of the children had died. ""Children without chronic illness are also at risk,"" the study authors wrote. ""Parents need to continue to take the virus seriously."" Publication of the study came the same day New York City officials announced that a growing cluster of children sickened with the coronavirus have developed a serious condition called pediatric multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome. So far, at least 52 children have been diagnosed with the syndrome, which causes high fever and swelling and may cause heart and kidney failure. Most are between the ages of 5 and 9. New York City officials said symptoms of the syndrome vary from patient to patient but include fever, rash, bright red lips, swollen hands and feet and abdominal pain. One five-year-old has died. ""This was not something that the health care community saw on their radar,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday at his daily coronavirus briefing. ""Then in the last week or two, suddenly, we’re seeing something that’s very troubling."" In other parts of New York state, 21 additional children with coronavirus symptoms have become seriously ill. It’s unclear whether any of the children sickened by pediatric multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome had underlying medical conditions. Half of the children in New York City who were diagnosed with the syndrome tested positive for COVID-19, meaning their bodies are battling an active infection and the syndrome simultaneously. Almost  two dozen other children with the syndrome tested positive for antibodies against the disease, meaning they had previously contracted the virus and recovered before they developed symptoms of the syndrome. It’s not known how many Pennsylvania children may have developed pediatric multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome. According to data from the state Department of Health, fewer than 3% of the almost 60,000 known coronavirus cases across the state are among children and teenagers. Speaking about the coronavirus, Turzai said children are ""not at risk unless they have an underlying medical issue.""

A March 24, 2017, story posted on Liberty-Courier.com carried the headline, ""Breaking: Autopsy results from Vince Foster’s exhumed body — Cause of death to be changed!"" The site, which is registered to an address in Utah, uses a name that evokes a newspaper, but is filled with fake news stories and has no immediately apparent contact information. The Foster story was flagged by Facebook users, who reported it as potentially being fake as part of the website’s efforts to push fabricated stories out of its news feeds. Foster, who was deputy counsel to President Bill Clinton and a former Arkansas law colleague of Hillary Clinton, committed suicide in 1993 at age 48, after suffering from depression. He was buried in his hometown of Hope, Ark. Conspiracy theories have raged for years that the Clintons actually had Foster killed for his knowledge of the Whitewater real estate deal or some other insight. President Donald Trump is among those who have questioned whether Foster actually committed suicide, despite five different investigations concluding he suffered a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound. The post, meanwhile, is fake, and has ended up on other fake news websites. It says that U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., had ordered Foster’s body exhumed. It cited a U.S. Navy officer as saying the forensics lab at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Va., determined Foster suffered two gunshot wounds, and his death should be reclassified as a homicide. Foster’s body has not been exhumed, and there is no Naval Hospital in Norfolk — although there is a Naval Medical Center across the Elizabeth River in Portsmouth, which used to be known as Naval Hospital Portsmouth. The post is accompanied by a photo that purports to be of naval forensics specialists, but actually is a handout photo from the Sacramento County (Calif.) Coroner’s Office. The story first appeared on March 22 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. Their posts often end up being repurposed by many other websites that don’t credit its origin, as is the case here. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t indicate this story or any other post is fake, but its About Us link notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."" TheLastLineOfDefense.org has developed a regular cottage industry of writing about Foster’s death. The site has previously written posts that said Gowdy had Foster’s body exhumed, then that it went missing from the morgue in Norfolk, or that WikiLeaks has proof of a conspiracy surrounding Foster’s death. The assertion that Foster’s body has been dug up, autopsied again and his death ruled a homicide is completely made up. We rate this statement",false,"Fake news, PunditFact, Bloggers, "

A seven-year-old child and his 44-year old father were among those who were killed in the North Cotabato province after they were struck by a boulder, disaster officials said. Authorities said the death toll could rise further because many injured were not immediately brought to hospitals. “It was depressing to see the damage left by the earthquake,” Abril Espadera, a disaster official in North Cotabato, told Reuters, as he recalled seeing collapsed homes and demolished buildings in the province, including schools. Smaller tremors rattled nervous residents throughout the day and those who were afraid to return to their homes set up tents to shelter near school yards, Espadera said. In Magsaysay town in Davao del Sur province, rescuers were trying to recover three bodies after landslides in two separate towns swallowed parts of agricultural areas, police said. The quake, whose magnitude was initially put at 6.7 by the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre, was the second powerful quake to strike Mindanao in two weeks. Authorities had flagged the risk of landslides after the 6.3 quake on Oct. 16 in central Mindanao that killed seven and injured more than 200. Earthquakes are common in the Philippines, which is on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire.

249,7766,Profit-hungry tiger breeders behind push to lift China’s trading ban.,"January 7, 2019","At the Siberia Tiger Park in the frigid Chinese city of Harbin, visitors can learn about the facility’s successful breeding programme and buy chicken carcasses to toss to around 20 tigers pacing the snow flecked ground of their enclosure.","Farah Master, Joyce Zhou","At the park gates, a shop sells liquor soaked with tiger bones for up to $1,000 a bottle. China has made significant strides in wildlife protection in recent years, including a total ban on ivory and plans to open one of the world’s largest reserves for wild tigers in northeast China in 2020. But it also has formidable, profit-driven wildlife business interests that risk undermining progress on protecting the endangered big cats, conservationists say. “The industry occupies a strategic position which concentrates in the country’s less developed regions where poverty reduction remains a top priority of the local authorities,” said Houston-based Peter Li, a China Policy Specialist at Humane Society International. Operators of tiger breeding farms have told state media that without the ability to sell bones, skins and meat they are not be able to cover the high costs of running their parks and carry out key conservation plans endorsed by the national government. After pressure from some breeders, China’s State Council said in October it would replace a 1993 ban on the trade of tiger bones and rhino horn, opening up exceptions under “special circumstances”, including medical research. But in November, Beijing postponed the move following widespread protests from conservation groups who worry any resumption in the legal trade of tiger parts will be a death knell for the species by enabling the laundering of wild animal parts into farmed supplies. Conservationists also argue that no captive Chinese bred tigers have been released into the wild and there is no scientific or medical need to use rhino horn and tiger bone in traditional Chinese medicine. Still, lifting the ban is backed by China’s powerful State Forestry and Grassland Administration. “If rhino horns and tiger bones can be used for medicinal purposes, and their use causes zero harm to the two endangered species in the wild, why should we oppose it?” Tang Xiaoping, an executive at the administration was quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper. The Forestry and Grasslands administration did not respond to multiple requests for comment. PROFIT-DRIVEN BUSINESS  At the Siberia Tiger Park, tiger bone wine is sold openly and is recognized by the Forestry Bureau and Commerce Ministry, according to a sales representative in the store. However, the park is not allowed to publicly promote it due to the sensitivity of the situation, the sales rep said. Officials at the park declined to comment on the record. The wine, which ranges in price from 280 yuan-6,888 yuan,  ($40-$1,003) is displayed in large glass cabinets and also sold on China’s Twitter-like WeChat. Park executives, officials and conservation experts say tiger parks have been accumulating stocks of animal skin and bone in freezers, with the aim of selling it for medicinal use in the future. Conservation groups estimate there are now over 6,500 farmed tigers at some 200 facilities in China and around 40 farmed rhinos. Chinese media say tiger bone can fetch 5,000-9,000 yuan ($727-$1,308) per kg - tens of thousands of dollars per animal. The World Wildlife Fund believes there are only around 40-50 wild tigers left in China out of around 3,900 globally. Debate over lifting the ban on tiger trade comes as China seeks to develop its traditional medicine industry, worth some $50 billion annually, and position it as a key pillar of its ‘One Belt One Road’ strategy. The World Health Organization is set to recognize traditional Chinese medicine for the first time next year in its global medical compendium according to Nature International Journal of Science, citing the governing body. The Siberian Tiger Park has more than 1,300 tigers spread across three locations. Selling tiger bone wine is a way to subsidize the daily expenses of the park, said one of the park’s tour guides. Currently, visitor fees are the parks’ main source of income, along with government subsidies. Ticket prices are 100 yuan and visitors can pay extra to feed the tigers. A menu of meat displays prices for a live chicken at 120 yuan while a raw cutlet is 10 yuan. In a CCTV documentary shown in November, Liu Dan, the chief engineer of the Northeast Tiger Forest park, near China’s border with Russia, says his 1,000-plus tigers each eat around 3,000 yuan ($435) worth of chicken per month. Liu, who has raised tigers for over 30 years and has repeatedly called for the ban on trading tiger parts to be lifted, told state media that government tax breaks are not enough for the park to be financially viable. Currently, parks make most of their money from visitors. Liu and the park declined to comment for this article. Chinese medicine experts say there is no need to use tiger bone and rhino horn in treatments as substitutes are readily available. Tiger bone, for example, is often used to treat arthritis and joint pain, but there are dozens of other herbs with similar properties, said Eric Karchmer, chief medicine officer at Dao Labs. Lixin Huang, the president of the American College of Traditional medicine, said a reversal of the ban would create a huge challenge for the Chinese medicine community. “We stopped using it 25 years ago. We don’t understand. I don’t think the Chinese medicine community and medical professionals would understand.”",true,Environment
250,9720,Talk Therapy Found to Ease Schizophrenia,"October 22, 2015","Update: The Times has issued a correction to this story. The correction states that the story erroneously claimed that the experimental approach in the study used lower drug dosages. “Though it studied a program intended to reduce medication dosages, the researchers do not yet know for sure if dosages were lowered or by how much,” the correction notes.”Therefore, the study did not conclude ‘that schizophrenia patients who received smaller doses of antipsychotic medication and a bigger emphasis on one-on-one talk therapy and family support made greater strides in recovery.’ (The study did conclude that the alternative treatment program as a whole led to better outcomes. )” We changed the headline of our review from “Times captures impact of new, less drug-intensive schizophrenia treatment” to “Times explores impact of integrated care model for schizophrenia treatment.” The correction does not affect our ratings for the story, but the references we made in the review to the lowered drug dosages are no longer appropriate and have been stricken. In addition, the tone of the review would have been more circumspect had we known that the intended reduction in drug dosages had not been confirmed by the researchers. In a large randomized controlled trial in 34 community clinics across the U.S., researchers compared usual care for first episode psychosis with a program of integrated care that included not only drugs, but also help with school and work, family education about the problems and how best to help, as well as one-on-one talk therapy. The government (National Institute of Mental Health)-funded study found that those receiving the integrated program of care experienced more symptom relief and functioned better than those in the treatment-as-usual group. Their doses of medication were also 20-50% lower. Those receiving treatment earlier on in their psychotic episodes also did better. The story overall does a solid job of covering the study and its implications. But we wish it had pushed a bit harder to quantify the benefits shown in the 2-year trial with some hard numbers. We applaud the discussion of federal policy and financing, but also wish there had been some discussion of the costs of therapy itself. The inclusion of a variety of perspectives on the research brings depth and nuance to the coverage. Psychiatric treatment in the U.S. has become very drug focused. Other countries are ahead of us on using more integrated care models like the one described in this story, so it’s great to see its success “proven” with a randomized trial. With solid evidence to back it, this model will hopefully become a more accepted approach to practice in the U.S.","Sally James,Susan Molchan, MD, MA,Kevin Lomangino","The story does not touch on costs for the more comprehensive treatment — including educating families and providing more counseling for patients. True costs and potential savings would be very hard to quantify, and would accrue over time as people hopefully stay in school and jobs, and have fewer admissions to the hospital etc. Even if the story couldn’t address these issues precisely, some mention of them would have been helpful. We do applaud the story for exploring the political and reimbursement context. This was especially good: Its [study] findings have already trickled out to government agencies: On Friday, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services published in its influential guidelines a strong endorsement of the combined-therapy approach.Mental health reform bills now being circulated in Congress “mention the study by name,” said Dr. Robert K. Heinssen, the director of services and intervention research at the centers, who oversaw the research. The story says drug doses were 20-50% lower, which is a very big deal considering the side effects of these drugs. But overall it leaves us hungry for numbers. It says patients in the therapy group, who received more one-on-one talk therapy and family counseling “made greater strides in recovery over the first two years of treatment than patients who got the usual drug-focused care.” But nowhere in the story does it tell us how “strides” were measured or give us a percentage by which they exceeded those for the control group. It would have taken some additional legwork to find these numbers, which were not reported in plain English in the study itself. But the paper did report some numbers that were very easy to understand and were not mentioned in the story: “Over the 2 years, 34% of the NAVIGATE group and 37% of the community care group (adjusted for length of exposure) had been hospitalized for psychiatric indications (not significant).” We wished the story had pressed the study authors more about this. It’s conceivable that changing the standard of care for patients by reducing drug doses may carry some risk. Could some patients’ symptoms be less-well controlled? Then again, drugs are very much overused in this area. And on average the study showed better symptom relief with the lower doses. No harms were documented in the study–no increase in hospitalizations at least. So while we can’t give credit here, we won’t ding the story either. We’ll rate it Not Applicable. While we would have liked a few more numbers, the story does explain that the comprehensive study included many clinics nationwide and two years of follow up on 404 patients. Since schizophrenia is a chronic condition, studies going beyond two years would help solidify these results — and the study itself mentioned that the researchers plan to follow patients out to five years. Overall, however, we think the description of the evidence is sufficient to warrant a Satisfactory rating. There was no disease mongering. The story quotes experts who were not authors on the study. There were good explanations of the two alternatives being compared by the research itself — the drug-focused standard and the more comprehensive integrated care. The story touches on availability when it says, “In 2014, Congress awarded $25 million in block grants to the states to be set aside for early-intervention mental health programs. So far, 32 states have begun using those grants to fund combined-treatment services, Dr. Heinssen said.” That doesn’t provide as much detail as readers might like as to when and where they might find these services, but it gives a general idea of where things stand. The story makes it clear that this was the most rigorous trial of this particular version of treatment in the United States. It notes that such treatment has been more widely used in Europe. The story shows original reporting and does not rely on a news release.",true,"anti-psychotic drugs,mental illness,schizophrenia,talk therapy"
252,26524,"John Bel Edwards Says of the coronavirus threat, “there was not a single suggestion by anyone, a doctor, a scientist, a political figure, that we needed to cancel Mardi Gras.”","April 8, 2020","The Carnival season in New Orleans kicked off early January and ended Feb. 25. There were few coronavirus cases in the United States at the time, and health officials then said there was no community spread. The earliest indication we found from a federal agency saying that large events may need to be canceled came Feb. 26, after Mardi Gras celebrations.",Miriam Valverde,"Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards on CNN was asked whether Mardi Gras celebrations in his state should have been called off earlier this year, in light of Louisiana now being considered a hotspot in the coronavirus pandemic. In New Orleans, the Carnival parades and celebrations started early January and ended Feb. 25 on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday). It’s estimated that more than 1 million people go to New Orleans annually for the Carnival season and experts now believe the festivities fueled the outbreak. ""The biggest Mardi Gras parades in Louisiana took place on Feb. 25, just as the national outbreak was starting. In retrospect, if you knew then what you know now, would you have canceled Mardi Gras?"" CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Edwards on April 5. ""Well, you know you don't get a do-over like that, Jake,"" Edwards said. ""There was not a single suggestion by anyone, a doctor, a scientist, a political figure, that we needed to cancel Mardi Gras. And, you know, in February, we had a Super Bowl, and it wasn't canceled and so forth."" Edwards’ comments echoed a similar statement from New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell 10 days earlier on CNN that there were ""no red flags"" from federal officials to suggest the festivities should be aborted. PolitiFact wondered if it’s  that there were no suggestions back in January or February that mass gatherings like Mardi Gras be canceled. We reviewed statements from President Donald Trump, and guidance from federal and state public health agencies and found that Edwards was right. Public health professors in Louisiana also told PolitiFact that there was no suggestion, prior to Mardi Gras, of community spread in the United States, much less New Orleans. The earliest suggestion we found from a federal agency saying that large events may need to be canceled came Feb. 26, after Mardi Gras celebrations. On Twitter and in public remarks, Trump did not suggest that large public events be canceled. In India on Feb. 25 and before leaving for India on Feb. 23, Trump said the coronavirus was very ""under control"" in the United States. Trump tweeted about the virus at least eight times from January to Feb. 25. His tweets generally said that his administration was in contact with China and others about the coronavirus, offered praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s handling of the outbreak, and said that his administration was monitoring developments and had it under control. On Lundi Gras, the day before Mardi Gras, he tweeted: The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me! When the U.S. declared the coronavirus a public health emergency on Jan. 31, the government did not say that mass gatherings be canceled. Throughout January and most of February, U.S. officials said that the coronavirus risk to the American public was low and that they were not seeing community spread of the virus. By Feb. 25, there were 53 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States and no deaths, according to data compiled by the World Health Organization. On Feb. 26, the day after Mardi Gras, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doctor told reporters that the coronavirus situation was rapidly evolving and that the virus was spreading worldwide. There were still only a few cases in the United States and no reports of community spread, but that would eventually change, said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. She said there were mitigation guidelines that people and communities could take during a pandemic when there wasn’t a vaccine or proven medical treatment for the disease. ""On a larger scale, communities and cities may need to modify, postpone, or cancel mass gatherings,"" Messonnier said. Local communities would need to figure out which guidelines to implement and when, she said, based on the severity and the transmission of the disease and what could be done locally. On Feb. 28, Messonnier said it was possible that a reported case in California ""could be the first instance of community spread — meaning the illness was acquired through an unknown exposure in the community."" But it could also be that the patient was exposed through contact to a traveler who was infected, Messonnier said. The immediate risk to the general American public remained low, she said. On Feb. 29, a health official from Washington state, where there were four presumptive cases of COVID-19, joined a CDC press briefing and said the state was ""starting to see some spread in the community"" and the public risk was increasing. ""Should we start to see more spread in Washington, we might consider recommending measures like cancelling large public events,"" said Kathy Lofy, the state health officer at the Washington state department of health. There were no reported cases of coronavirus in Louisiana during the weeks-long Carnival celebrations. The state’s department of health in blog posts as late as Feb. 21 said that the coronavirus threat to Louisiana was very low and that people should be more worried about the flu. It recommended that people wash their hands and get a flu shot, since it was still flu season. Louisiana’s first presumptive case of coronavirus was reported March 9, two days before the World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus a pandemic. On March 13, when Louisiana had 33 presumptive positive cases of COVID-19, Edwards signed a proclamation to stop gatherings of more than 250 people and close all K-12 public schools statewide to slow the spread of the disease. Based on models created mid-March, it’s assumed that infections silently spread in crowded parades during Mardi Gras, said Susanne Straif-Bourgeois, an associate professor of epidemiology at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans. Soon after Mardi Gras, epidemiologists from nearby states began reporting confirmed cases of coronavirus in people who had traveled to New Orleans for the festivities. But at the time that parade-goers gathered in streets with family and friends, it was not known that the virus was in the state, Straif-Bourgeois said. In his CNN interview with Edwards, Tapper said the Washington Post reported that governors had a gala in Washington, D.C. in early February, and that a group of governors met with federal experts who gave ""the same dire warning that they’re giving now."" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told the Washington Post, ""The doctors and the scientists, they were telling us then exactly what they are saying now."" Edwards told Tapper that in that Feb. 9 briefing, ""we spoke generally about the novel coronavirus"" and that it was ""not accurate to say that they gave the same sort of information that they are providing right now,"" since a lot more is now known about the virus. Edwards’ deputy chief of staff, Christina Stephens, told PolitiFact that at that briefing, the virus was described as low risk and there was no suggestion that large gatherings be canceled. In a Feb. 9 press release about the briefing, the U.S. Health and Human Services department said the task force ""reiterated that while this is a serious public health matter, the risk to the American public remains low at this time, and that the federal government will continue working in close coordination with state and local governments to keep it that way."" Edwards said of the coronavirus threat, ""there was not a single suggestion by anyone, a doctor, a scientist, a political figure, that we needed to cancel Mardi Gras."" New Orleans Mardi Gras celebrations began early January and ended Feb. 25. PolitiFact reviewed public comments from Trump, federal and state health officials on and before Feb. 25 and did not find suggestions that large public events be cancelled.

We offer a variety of suggestions below in this review for how the story could have been more accurate and informative.

They make it harder to reach readers with potentially useful, evidence-based information that could improve health.",Kevin Lomangino,"The spice aisle can get pricey, but we won’t ding the story for not discussing the cost of cardamom. The story is peppered with references to the cancer-fighting properties of spices. Tumeric is “a great antioxidant, it’s got great anti-cancer properties.” And “garlic, onions, shallots and leeks can also act as cancer preventers. Freshly ground pepper can “even help prevent breast cancer tumors from growing.”  But nothing in the story is quantified. Whatever studies these claims are based on are not described in any way. We won’t penalize the story for not delving into the potential downsides of too much spicy food. The story does contain a warning “not to overdo it.” The claim about pepper “prevent[ing] breast cancer tumors from growing” seems to be based on this petri dish study from 2009. But the news release for that study warned, “Note: This work has not been tested in patients, and patients are not encouraged to add curcumin or piperine supplements to their diet at this time.” The story contained no such caveat. We’re not sure where the story gets the idea that a fennel-ginger broth  “can help to fight off harmful cancer cells.” Neither this nor any of the other claims are adequately sourced and no description of the underlying evidence is provided. The story refers vaguely to “studies.” What studies? By whom? Providing links to the underlying studies would at least have allowed readers to see where this evidence came from and what kind of research we’re talking about. The story doesn’t exaggerate the impact of cancer. Nor does it provide any context about the disease. We’ll rate this Not Applicable. The only source quoted is the celebrity chef, who also happens to be hawking a book with spicy recipes. Consulting a physician or someone else with nutrition or cancer expertise would have boosted the credibility of this information. The story missed an opportunity to discuss which diet and lifestyle factors are actually associated with reduced cancer risk and might be worth adopting. For instance, maintaining a healthy bodyweight, regular physical activity, avoiding excessive alcohol, etc. Merely adding spice to unhealthy foods will not reduce the risk of cancer — something the story could have been clearer about. The availability of spicy food is not in question. Is there anything new here besides the chef’s forthcoming cookbook, which will be publishing this year according to his website? If so, the story doesn’t establish what that is. This promotional-themed story seems like it could have been prompted by a news release. But the video accompanying the story seems to provide evidence of an actual interview that forms the basis for the quotes in the story. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here.",false,"Cancer,Diet studies,Fox News"
256,28230,Cocoa mulch contains a chemical (theobromine) that can be harmful to pets.,"May 25, 2003",Veterinarians have warned that cacao shells contain the same ingredient that makes chocolate toxic to dogs.,Snopes Staff,"This warning about the potential danger to pets posed by cocoa mulch began appearing in our inbox in May 2003. Example:  Cocoa Mulch, which is sold by Home Depot, Foreman’s Garden Supply and other Garden supply stores, contains a lethal ingredient called “Theobromine”. It is lethal to dogs and cats. It smells like chocolate and it really attracts dogs. They will ingest this stuff and die. Several deaths already occurred in the last 2-3 weeks. Just a word of caution — check what you are using in your gardens and be aware of what your gardeners are using in your gardens. Theobromine is the ingredient that is used to make all chocolate — especially dark or baker’s chocolate — which is toxic to dogs. Cocoa bean shells contain potentially toxic quantities of theobromine, a xanthine compound similar in effects to caffeine and theophylline. A dog that ingested a lethal quantity of garden mulch made from cacao bean shells developed severe convulsions and died 17 hours later. Analysis of the stomach contents and the ingested cacao bean shells revealed the presence of lethal amounts of theobromine. Although there is at least some truth to this one, the dangers it warns about are by now somewhat outdated and exaggerated: most dogs aren’t really interested in eating cocoa mulch, some brands of that product have been reformulated to reduce or eliminate the potentially dog-dangerous substance it contains (theobromine), and we know of only one substantiated case of a pet death caused by ingestion of the substance. (In July 2007, “Moose,” a 3-year-old Labrador belonging to a Minneapolis couple, died after eating cocoa mulch purchased at a local store. His owners had a veterinarian at the University of Minnesota perform a necropsy to determine the likely cause of death of their young and previously healthy pet. The vet found cocoa shells in Moose’s stomach and evidence of theobromine in the shells.) Cocoa mulch, made of cacao shells, is popular with gardeners and landscapers for a number of reasons: it has an aromatic scent, it repels garden pests, it retains moisture well, and it has a rich brown color that darkens (rather than fades) over time. However, veterinarians have warned pet owners that cacao shells also naturally contain theobromine, the same ingredient that makes chocolate toxic to dogs:  “Cocoa mulch is a risk, especially to dogs,” said Dr. Larry Family of Aqueduct Animal Hospital. Found in most home garden centers, cocoa mulch is known for its fine texture and the sweet smell the fresh mulch gives off. But getting past the scent, Family says cocoa mulch can be dangerous if a dog starts eating it. It contains two key ingredients found in chocolate: theobromine and caffeine. Similar to eating chocolate, he says a dog that eats just a few ounces of cocoa mulch could starting having stomach problems and it could get worse if it eats more. “As time goes on they might act restless, excited, it can produce tremors and seriously seizures,” Family explained. “Puppies are very curious animals. So they’re going to be attracted to various things around the yard and [the effect of eating cocoa mulch] seems to be more severe in the small breeds, and it depends on the amount they actually ingest,” Family said. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) confirms the potential effects of theobromine and caffeine on dogs:  Cocoa beans contain the stimulants caffeine and theobromine. Dogs are highly sensitive to these chemicals, called methylxanthines. In dogs, low doses of methylxanthine can cause mild gastrointestinal upset (vomiting, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain); higher doses can cause rapid heart rate, muscle tremors, seizures, and death. Eaten by a 50-pound dog, about 2 ounces of cocoa bean mulch may cause gastrointestinal upset; about 4.5 ounces, increased heart rate; about 5.3 ounces, seizures; and over 9 ounces, death. (In contrast, a 50-pound dog can eat up to about 7.5 ounces of milk chocolate without gastrointestinal upset and up to about a pound of milk chocolate without increased heart rate.) According to tables we’ve examined, cocoa mulch contains  300-1200 mg. of theobromine per ounce, making cocoa mulch one of the strongest concentrations of theobromine a pet is likely to encounter in any chocolate product. However, the question of the gravity of the risk presented by this type of gardening mulch remains a matter of debate. According to Hershey‘s, for example:  It is true that studies have shown that 50% of the dogs that eat Cocoa Mulch can suffer physical harm to a variety of degrees (depending on each individual dog). However, 98% of all dogs won’t eat it. And some of those who vend cocoa mulch note that although they’re aware of the pet warnings, they’ve never encountered a case of a dog’s being sickened by the product:  “The weird thing is, it smells like a chocolate Pop Tart. That’s the best way I can describe it. It really does have a chocolate scent to it,” explained Shane Compton of Hewitt’s Garden Center. Compton says cocoa mulch is not that popular at his store, but says it has its regular customers who every now and then wonder about the rumors they hear and the effect it has on man’s best friend. “There’s always stories on the Internet, but in the 30 years we’ve been here we’ve actually never heard of any body’s dog getting sick,” Compton said. Some manufacturers of cocoa mulch (such as the Cocoa Mulch brand) now proclaim that their products are theobromine-free and pet safe. Responsible pet owners should take care in their selection of cocoa mulch brands; some might prefer  to choose another form of soil enhancement for their gardens, such as cedar-based products, rather than gamble their dogs won’t be attracted to or harmed by cocoa mulch. (Although Home Depot is named as a vendor of cocoa mulch in the example cited at the head of this page, the company told us in May 2006 that: “The Home Depot does not and will not sell mulch harmful to pets. The mulch sold by The Home Depot containing cocoa shells goes through several cleaning processes, including a high heat system in order to strip the cocoa fat from the shells without the use of any chemicals.”) The danger of canine theobromine poisoning does not begin and end with cocoa mulch, however: chocolate in any form poses substantial risks to some pets. This most beloved of foodstuffs contains theobromine and small amounts of caffeine, both of which can sicken and even kill cats and dogs. Chocolate’s toxicity to animals is directly related to three factors: the type of chocolate, the size of the animal, and the amount of chocolate ingested. Unsweetened baking chocolate presents the greatest danger to pets because it contains the highest amount of theobromine, approximately 390-450 mg. per ounce. White chocolate contains the least. As a general rule of thumb, one ounce of milk chocolate per pound of body weight can be lethal for dogs and cats. (Milk chocolate contains approximately 44-66 mg of theobromine per ounce.) Theobromine affects the heart, central nervous system, and kidneys, causing nausea and vomiting, restlessness, diarrhea, muscle tremors, and increased urination. Cardiac arrhythmia and seizures are symptoms of more advanced poisoning. Other than induced vomiting, vets have no treatment or antidote for theobromine poisoning. Death can occur in 12 to 24 hours. This type of poisoning is uncommon because it is rare that a dog, even a small dog, will eat enough chocolate to cause anything more than an upset stomach. Yet it can happen, especially if the animal gets into baking chocolate or powdered cocoa, two forms of the sweet particularly loaded with theobromine. Do not feed chocolate to dogs or cats. If you keep a pet, do not leave chocolate lying about lest your critter help himself to it and in so doing poison himself. If your animal begins exhibiting signs of distress and you believe he might have gotten into some chocolate, call your veterinarian immediately. (It will help if you can supply information about the approximate weight of your critter, what sort of chocolate was ingested — white, milk, dark, cocoa powder, baking — and roughly how much.) But time is of the essence if such a poisoning has indeed taken place, so make the call right away.",true,"Critter Country, Crusader Habit, dogs, gardening"
259,7978,Shortage of drugs and equipment: Brussels hospitals sound the alarm.,"April 1, 2020","Hospitals in the Belgian capital called on the federal government on Wednesday to address a shortage of medicines and equipment, as COVID-19 patients continue to arrive at intensive care units that are starting to fill up.",Marine Strauss,"“Federal authorities do not seem to see or hear that the reality is that hospitals are in a massive shortage of all protective gear and drugs needed to treat COVID-19 patients and other categories of equipment like syringes,” around 10 public and private hospitals said in a statement issued via the federation of hospitals and care homes for Belgium’s regions of Brussels and Wallonia known as Santhea. Belgium, with some 11.5 million people, is one of the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus in Europe. Some 4,995 people have been hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms in the country, meaning around half of the health services’ capacity has been taken up treating the disease. The health ministry says it expects the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 to peak in the coming days and weeks. Except for real emergencies, hospitals are focused on COVID-19 patients only. “The situation is really dramatic,” the statement said, adding that the hospitals are currently working with a three-day stock of medicines and fear they would soon no longer be able to offer adequate care. Belgium’s health ministry announced earlier on Wednesday that its stock of drugs such as curare, a drug to relax muscles of intubated patients, would last until mid-April. The reality on the ground seems different as “there is a real shortage of curare-type drugs and for other drugs, it becomes really very difficult,” said Valerie Victoor, general adviser at Santhea. Belgium reported its death toll rose by 123 to a total of 828 people on Wednesday, and its number of cases was up 1,189 to 13,964. Officials said the nation’s testing capacity would reach 10,000 daily by the end of the week.",true,Health News
261,13262,"Just like Donald Trump, David Jolly wants to outlaw a woman's right to choose.","October 24, 2016","An ad from the DCCC said, ""Just like Donald Trump, David Jolly wants to outlaw a woman's right to choose."" Trump and Jolly both favor restrictions on abortion, but their views cannot be directly equated to outlawing all instances of abortion. Moreover, the claim, and the overall theme of the ad — that Jolly would be an ally to Trump — is highly misleading. Jolly does not support Trump.",Allison Graves,"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a bizarre ad in October warning that a vote for Congressman David Jolly in the 13th Congressional District is a vote for Donald Trump's right-hand man. The ad ties Jolly and Trump together through photoshopped images and shared views on opposing abortion rights and defunding Planned Parenthood. ""Just like Donald Trump, David Jolly wants to outlaw a woman's right to choose,"" says the narrator in the ad. This remark stood out to us, so we wanted to take a look at each man’s view on abortions. Moreover, the goal of the ad and its methods have been widely criticized, so we’ll examine the relationship between Trump and Jolly. The evidence linking Trump and Jolly’s stances on abortion is hard to pinpoint, given the fact both have talked about abortion in different ways. What’s not hard to pinpoint is the relationship between Trump and Jolly, which just doesn’t exist. Jolly has never met Trump, nor is he supporting him for president. Trump and Jolly on abortion Trump and Jolly are are on the same side of the abortion spectrum, but their views are hard to lump together as one and the same. Jolly’s campaign told PolitiFact Florida he calls himself pro-life, but has never supported or voted to outlaw abortion entirely. At the congressional debate on Sept. 19, Jolly was asked if it's right for a woman to abort her baby if she finds out she has Zika in the early stages of pregnancy. Jolly responded: ""I think that is her choice, but for the health of the mother or the health of the baby, or the life of the mother, I think there should be exceptions permitted to terminate the pregnancy. Yes, I do."" There are other exceptions Jolly embraces, too, including instances of rape or incest. Jolly may say he doesn’t support outlawing abortion, but what does his voting record say? The DCCC points to the ""Life at Conception Act"" (H.R. 1091) that Jolly co-sponsored in 2014. This act would give a fetus the same rights as a human beings from the moment of fertilization. This is clearly an anti-abortion rights bill, but as PolitiFact concluded in 2014, there’s a lot of murkiness that courts would have to sort through before it would be clear if abortion would be outlawed. Whether or not Trump wants to outlaw abortion is hard to determine. In March, Trump stated women should be punished for having an abortion. (You can read the whole remark in context here.) But he backed off saying women should specifically be punished to stating general opposition to abortion. ""If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,"" the Trump statement says. ""The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed — like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions."" Recently at the third presidential debate, Trump was asked if he wants the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, which would essentially dissolve a woman’s right to abortions. Trump said: ""Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states."" Jolly does not support Trump This ad has been highly criticized for its bogus images showing Trump and Jolly photoshopped together. Like the claim, the ad attempts to paint Trump and Jolly as one in the same — and allies if both Jolly and Trump win. This association is not accurate. At the congressional debate, Jolly said he doesn’t support Trump and told the Tampa Bay Times he never met him. Jolly’s spokesperson reiterated that point to PolitiFact Florida on Oct. 20 and said Jolly will not be supporting Trump in this election. Jolly called on Trump to drop out of the presidential race in December after Trump called for a temporary ban on Muslims. At the time of the press release, Jolly was running for Marco Rubio’s seat in the U.S. Senate. ""While ISIS is beheading innocent people for their religious practices, Trump is betraying our freedoms,"" Jolly said in a statement. ""His brutal, bullying bigotry runs contrary to the very principles our forefathers fought so hard to defend. We are either a party of protecting the constitution and religious liberties or we're not. America should insist on a security test but never a religious test."" Our ruling An ad from the DCCC said, ""Just like Donald Trump, David Jolly wants to outlaw a woman's right to choose."" Trump and Jolly both favor restrictions on abortion, but their views cannot be directly equated to outlawing all instances of abortion. Moreover, the claim, and the overall theme of the ad — that Jolly would be an ally to Trump — is highly misleading. Jolly does not support Trump.

Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergencies expert, said the world was “moving to an uncertain future”. “You see many countries around the world are just beginning the cycle of this epidemic. Some have been through the cycle of the epidemic like Singapore and China and are now desperately trying not to have the disease re-emerge and cause another wave of infections because of disease importations,” he said. Elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions have been the hardest hit, but 10 to 15% of people under the age of 50 have moderate to severe infection, Ryan said. Asked about reports of infections in young adults, Ryan said: “For most people it is a very mild infection, most young people. But for a significant minority of people between the age of 20 and 60 this is a significant infection.”  “What is really emerging is a perception that this disease, while not fatal and not causing critical disease in a younger age group, is causing severe illness in many people,” Ryan said. Every infection of COVID-19 presents an opportunity for onward spread, said Dr. Maria van Kerkhove. “So even in younger populations, if you do have a mild disease and you think it’s no big deal, what the big deal is is that you may transmit to somebody else who may be part of that vulnerable population who may advance to severe disease and who may die,” she said. The data showed that “the majority of children that are infected are experiencing mild disease,” ver Kerkhove said. “But we do have reports, and there are some publications now that describe severe disease in children. We have reports of deaths in children. There is one in China, and I believe one in the United States as well,” she said.",true,Health News
263,9205,Progesterone may be key to preventing recurrent miscarriage,"January 18, 2017","This is a somewhat confusing news release that contained very few of the most important details from the study — effectiveness, safety and cost, for example — that anyone would want to know if they were interested in preventing miscarriage. The confusion arises around what is being tested: is it the progesterone, the nCyclinE molecular marker or the Endometrial Function Test (EFT) used in this experiment to identify a subset of women who would benefit from progesterone? Our reviewers were baffled and readers likely will be, too. Progesterone has been clinically used to prevent unexplained early miscarriage. Some early meta-analyses had suggested a reduction in miscarriages, but later trials showed no difference. If you are going to make a claim that progesterone prevents miscarriage, you should have more than a 116-person study to back up that claim. Preventing miscarriages could be a major public health advance and have a very profound effect on the lives of parents and families. If a cheap, safe and effective treatment could be prescribed to prevent untimely deaths of fetuses that would be welcome news. Potential mothers who have experienced the pain of miscarriage, however, should not be inadvertently led astray from headlines that promise miscarriage prevention without adequate study of the safety and effectiveness of that treatment. We’ve noted concerns with Yale’s PR communications previously, for example here and here.","Alan Cassels,Karen Carlson, MD,Kathlyn Stone","The release does not discuss costs. Cost for generic progesterone range from about $20 to $30 for 30 – 100mg capsules, according to GoodRx’s drug prices tracker. The release claims that progesterone prevents miscarriages. How many miscarriages did it help prevent and how was this assessed? There aren’t any numbers. With any drug treatment related to pregnancy it is absolutely essential to discuss the effects of the drug on both mother and child. This news release doesn’t address safety risks to either. The Mayo Clinic’s website for patients offers a long list of possible side effects from progesterone in adults. Much less information is available about progesterone’s risk to a developing fetus. There was no basic information provided about what kind of study this was, and few explanatory statements that would help readers to assess the quality of the evidence. At the end we receive this helpful quote — “The positive results show us that next we need to study progesterone as a treatment for recurrent pregnancy loss with a prospective randomized trial to validate the findings. — but it’s too late and insufficient to help readers evaluate the study. There is no obvious disease mongering here. The release does provide some context about miscarriages, stating that it “affects 30,000 women each year in the United States. About 25% of all women who become pregnant have a first-trimester loss.” The release doesn’t mention who funded the study, which is necessary to meet our standard. It does note that the “research team used the endometrial function test (EFT®), which was created by study co-author Harvey J. Kliman, M.D., director of the Reproductive and Placental Research Unit in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine.” However, the release doesn’t acknowledge an important conflict of interest that is addressed in the study manuscript itself: “H.J.K. is the inventor of a patent related to the monitoring of endometrial glandular development.” Are there alternative methods to determine the health of a fetus and other potential treatments to prevent miscarriage? The release doesn’t say. Progesterone is widely available, but what about the EFT? We don’t have any idea after reading this news release. We found no evidence relating to EFT in a review of clinical reproductive medicine guidelines. This release doesn’t establish the novelty of this approach. Other research studies have looked at the use of progesterone in preventing miscarriages. According to the reference site “UpToDate” by medical publishers Wolter Kluwer, more than 50 research studies have examined the use of progesterone in preventing miscarriage or pre-term birth, with mixed results. There is no obvious use of unjustified language, but the last paragraph contains some somewhat intemperate language from one of the co-investigators who said: “We are very pleased to find that these results reinforce the evidence that progesterone could be a very beneficial, inexpensive, and safe treatment for many women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss.” Beneficial? Inexpensive? Safe? None of these attributes were described adequately in this news release.",false,"miscarriage,progesterone,Yale University"
264,29256,Pepsi admitted that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients.,"February 26, 2018","The CEH was able to pressure PepsiCo into imposing strict guidelines on the manufacturing of the caramel color they use and to make a legal commitment to have 4-MEI levels in their soda regularly tested. They did not however, compel PepsiCo to admit, as claimed, that their sodas “contain cancer-causing ingredients.”",Alex Kasprak,"In 2016, the one-stop paranoia and supplement shop “Natural News” web site published an article, headlined “Pepsi Admits Its Soda Contains Cancer-Causing Ingredients,” that discussed a legal battle between the environmental health watchdog Center for Environmental Health (CEH) and PepsiCo which took place between 2011 and 2015. Clickbait websites have aggregated that story and ensured its continued virality by sharing it on highly followed Facebook accounts such as “March Against Monsanto.” The 2016 Natural News article documented the Center for Environmental Health’s effort to uncover levels of a chemical called 4-Methylimidazole (4-MEI) in cola products that were higher than the legal limits imposed by the state of California’s Proposition 65. 4-MEI is not directly added to colas, but it is a byproduct of processes that produce the caramel coloring that is typically added to such soft drinks: “4-methylimidazole (4-MEI) is a chemical compound that is not directly added to food; rather it is formed as a byproduct in some foods and beverages during the normal cooking process. [4-MEI] forms as a trace impurity during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring … that are used to color cola-type beverages and other foods.” To understand the legal challenge from the Center for Environmental Health and the claims made about this case by Natural News, though, one need first understand the regulatory history that culminated in efforts to reduce the chemical’s occurrence in soda. Is 4-Methylimidazole a Carcinogen? A number of international, national, and state or local governmental agencies evaluate the safety and possible carcinogenicity of various food or cosmetic products, and they don’t always reach the same conclusions. The first group that raised specific alarm about the carcinogenic potential of 4-MEI was the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP), which released a study in 2007 suggesting that massively high doses of 4-MEI may have given male and female mice lung cancer and may have given female rats Leukemia. The state of California has some of the strictest laws in the world regarding required warnings about chemicals that may produce carcinogenic or reproductive harm. This situation is due to Proposition 65, also called the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act, which since 1986 has mandated the publication of a list of chemicals that are “known to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity” and imposed labeling requirements on any product sold in California that includes relevant concentrations of these chemicals. When the 2007 National Toxicology Program study was published, the state of California was given their first legal rationale to include 4-MEI in the Proposition 65 list, because the National Toxicology Program is one of the organizations the act defines as a valid arbiter of carcinogenicity. In January 2011, after a period of review, 4-MEI was indeed added to California’s Proposition 65 list. While the National Toxicology Program and the State of California consider 4-MEI a potential carcinogen, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are far less concerned with it as a potential cancer risk in food products. In 2011, the EFSA re-evaluated 4-MEI and other byproducts of caramel color processing, finding that the levels Europeans were exposed to through food consumption were far lower than those that would raise any plausible carcinogenicity concerns. Currently, the FDA’s position on 4-MEI is that the National Toxicology Program study showing harm in rodents had limited relevance to humans, because it was performed on laboratory animals exposed to levels of 4-MEI higher than any human would reasonably be exposed to: “Based on the available information, FDA has no reason to believe that there is any immediate or short-term danger presented by 4-MEI at the levels expected in food from the use of caramel coloring.” However, the State of California, basing their decision on numbers derived from those animal studies, ruled that any product containing levels of 4-MEI exceeding a certain concentration would have to be labeled as a potential carcinogen. Did Pepsi “Admit” That Their Products Contain “Cancer-Causing Ingredients”? After 4-MEI was added to the Proposition 65 list, the Center for Environmental Health sampled cola products from California for compliance with that regulation and found that a number of Pepsi and Coca-Cola products contained levels of 4-MEI exceeding the allowable limits established by California’s Proposition 65. The CEH filed a legal complaint on 23 February 2012, whereupon both Coca-Cola and Pepsi announced their intent to bring 4-MEI levels in the sodas into compliance with California law, as reported in a 9 March 2012 Reuters article: Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc are making changes to the production of an ingredient in their namesake colas to avoid the need to label the packages with a cancer warning. The change is meant to reduce the amount of a chemical called 4-methylimidazole, or [4-MEI], which in January was added to the list of chemicals covered by California’s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, also known as Proposition 65 … Both companies said they started in California, and would expand the use of the reduced [4-MEI] caramel coloring over time. Subsequent to this announcement, the CEH once again tested a variety of colas from California and elsewhere around the country, finding that both Pepsi and Coca-Cola were now compliant in California, but that Pepsi had not changed their soft drink formulations outside of that state. As a result, the CEH continued their legal efforts against PepsiCo. On 17 September 2015, lawyers for PepsiCo and the CEH settled their dispute when they signed a consent judgement described thusly by the CEH: Under the settlement, finalized in Superior Court in Alameda County, Pepsi will require its ingredient suppliers to meet strict limits on the 4-MEI levels, which CEH found at high levels in 2012 in some colas made by Pepsi and other major companies. The settlement also requires Pepsi to test its cola products to ensure that the 4-MEI levels remain below the required level, and allows CEH to request further testing of Pepsi’s products. Although this agreement represented a major legal victory for the CEH (which was also awarded financial damages for their legal and scientific fees), it actually represented (legally, at least) the exact opposite of Pepsi’s “admitting its soda contains cancer-causing ingredients” as stated in viral headlines. This is clear in the section of the judgement labeled “NO ADMISSIONS”, which stipulates that PepsiCo never violated any law and that they were not required to admit or accept 4-MEI’s classification as a carcinogen: By executing this Consent Judgment and agreeing to provide the relief and remedies specified herein, [PepsiCo] does not admit (a) that it has violated, or threatened to violate Proposition 65 … or any other law or legal duty; or (b) that the chemical 4-MEI in [their colas] or in other foods or beverages poses any risk to human health or requires any disclosure or warning to consumers.",false,"Medical, carcinogens, coca-cola, pepsi"

Charles Boustany, R-La., a heart surgeon by profession, repeated a popular Republican talking point, saying the health care reform bill introduced in the House would  ""create 53 new government bureaucracies."" This claim originates with a detailed list complied by the House Republican Conference, which you can view  here  . Fifty-three new bureaucracies sounds like a lot, and the list is so specific, we decided to dig into it to see if it's legitimate. ""Bureaucracy"" can mean different things to different people, so we began with a trip to the Merriam-Webster dictionary to set some parameters. It defines it like this: ""a body of nonelective government officials; an administrative policy-making group; government characterized by specialization of functions, adherence to fixed rules, and a hierarchy of authority; a system of administration marked by officialism, red tape, and proliferation."" So, to the list... The first two are no-doubt-abouters. No. 1 is a Health Benefits Advisory Committee (Section 123, p. 30). This is a new panel of experts that will make recommendations to the secretary of Health and Human Services on covered health benefits. It's an advisory board, but a new entity nonetheless. New bureaucracy, check. No. 2 on the list is the creation of a Health Choices Administration (Section 141, p. 41). This is a biggie. The Health Choices Administration would be an independent executive branch agency charged with establishing qualified plan standards, creating the health insurance exchange and administering affordability credits for low-income people. New bureaucracy, check. After this, however, the list gets murkier. Consider No. 3, Qualified Health Benefits Plan Ombudsman. This person, or office, would be charged with helping people navigate the new health reform system and report to Congress on recommendations for improvements in administration of the program. It's part of the Health Choices Administration (No. 2 on the list). That sounds like double-counting to us. And that's true of a number of other items on the list as well. We're not going to detail all 53 items on the list. But here are a few general observations from our examination of them. Four of the items on the list include the creation of various trust funds. These are new funds, but they are to be created by existing agencies. These are essentially bank accounts. Those aren't new government bureaucracies in our book. The list also includes six pilot programs and three demonstration programs. These are small-scale demo programs. If the programs turn out to improve care and save money, the government will roll them out nationally. There's already an office in place in Medicare that runs demonstration programs. In fact, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act signed by President George W. Bush in 2003 included 14 new demonstration projects. It wouldn't be fair to call that 14 new bureaucracies then, and it's not fair to call these demonstration programs new bureaucracies now. ""The programs and demonstration projects they list aren't new agencies but rather new projects, and they're sensible ways to test new policies before more broadly implementing them,"" said Brian Cook, press secretary for Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., chair of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee. And, he said, ""many of the programs and demonstration projects are things that Republicans themselves have called for and supported."" The list also includes three new ombudsmen and a special inspector general for the Health Insurance Exchange. And again, these are individual offices in existing agencies — not bureaucracies. Three items on the list deal with comparative effectiveness research. Although the government already does such research, we think it's fair to count the creation of a new Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research on the list. But the next two items, a comparative effectiveness research commission and a patient ombudsman for comparative effectiveness research seems like triple-dipping. Ironically, said Stan Dorn, senior research associate at the left-leaning Urban Institute, those safeguards were put in to assure Republicans that the program would not be used to force insurers to comply with the council's research findings. ""Some of these things are new government bureaucracies,"" Dorn said. ""But a lot of these items are not new government agencies, they are new activities that existing agencies would be asked to perform."" By Dorn's count, 36 of the 53 items on the Republican list fall in that latter category. An example is an item on the list for a program of administrative simplification (Section 163, p. 57). It would be up to the department of Health and Human Services to implement the updated standards. ""That is not a new bureaucracy,"" Dorn said. ""That's an activity required of an existing government agency."" ""Just eyeballing this list,"" Dorn said, ""it is clearly way over the top."" We agree that there are lots of suspect items on the list and the Republicans' methodology in choosing them is inconsistent. But we also think it's fair for them to claim that the Democratic health plan would create new government bureaucracy. The plan would create new ways to subsidize health insurance for millions of low-income people. It would establish a health insurance exchange in which people not on plans provided by large companies could shop for competitive rates. That requires the creation of some new institutions. But they are wrong to cite 53 as the number. In fact, the number is clearly much smaller.",false,"National, Health Care, Charles Boustany, "

270,10139,New easy-to-use TB test achieves accuracy comparable to IGRAs in Phase III trials,"May 20, 2016","This news release summarizes the results of two clinical trials gauging the efficacy of a new test for tuberculosis — C-Tb. The study compared the new test with a more complex, and expensive, alternative and measures whether the new test works better in patients who are HIV-positive and/or who are vaccinated with the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine. The release provides adequate data for readers to trust its claims but doesn’t mention funding sources or address whether there was any potential for conflicts of interest. To its credit, however, the release includes a basic research abstract providing more detailed information on the results from the trials. Tuberculosis is a serious problem worldwide and the World Health Organization (WHO) has a stated goal of controlling, if not eradicating, the disease by 2035. As is noted, the most often used test (TST) is associated with a high false positive rate making inappropriate treatment more likely. Given the increasing resistance of the tuberculosis bacteria, a reduction in unnecessary antibiotic treatment is welcomed. Any new test that is more accurate, less expensive and convenient to use will certainly be an asset to that effort.","Earle Holland,Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Kathlyn Stone","This release provides a very good discussion of costs, stating, “There is also a dramatic price difference between the two diagnostic tests. According to Dr. Ruhwald, a TST costs about $2; an IGRA is 20 to 40 times more expensive depending on setting.” This gives readers a clear idea of the fiscal advantage of using the new test. The release provides information that the new test — the C-Tb — is almost as effective as the IGRA, or interferon gamma release assays, which are more expensive, require blood samples and complicated lab work. It also explains that C-Tb is less prone to produce false positives than the TST in BCG-vaccinated individuals. News releases on diagnostic tests should also address the balance between sensitivity — which is how good the test is at positively identifying people who actually have the problem – and specificity – how good the test is at ruling out people who don’t have the problem. This release addresses the specificity issue, stating “The specificity of C-Tb, unlike the TST, was not impacted by the BCG vaccine, the partially effective vaccine that many residents in the developing world receive. TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent. The sensitivity of C-Tb was comparable to the IGRA in confirmed TB cases (77 percent vs. 81 percent), indicating similar abilities to detect infection.” There is no mention of potential harms with this new test, leaving readers to assume its safety. Although relatively minor, side effects have been noted in previous clinical trials including: “Local adverse reactions following C-Tb injection included transient itching and discomfort as expected components of the immune response.” In addition, as with most diagnostic tests, there is a risk of false-positive (over-diagnosis) or false-negative (under-diagnosis) results. This should have been mentioned along with data on the test’s reliability. The release discusses the results of two phase-3 clinical trials comparing the new C-Tb test against existing tests for tuberculosis. It provides specific numerical data comparing the new and existing tests in several categories, and identifies both the number of sites where the trials were held and the number of participants in each trial — information that might give readers more confidence in the reported findings. The release does not commit disease mongering. Unfortunately, the release offers no information on either funding sources for these trials or on any possible conflicts of interest that might affect the researchers. Since the release is showing results of comparisons between existing tests for tuberculosis and the new C-Tb test, there clearly are alternatives, so we’ll give it a satisfactory grade in this category. The release informs readers that the test still faces a regulatory and commercial path, which strongly implies it is not yet available: “Regulatory approval for C-Tb is currently being sought and Statens Serum Institute is actively seeking a commercial partner for marketing of C-Tb. The cost of a C-Tb test is to be determined; however, it is expected to be significantly less than an IGRA.” The release basically says that this is a new test that’s cheaper and at least as effective, if not more effective, than existing diagnostic tools — and is less complicated to perform. That certainly qualifies as novel enough for a release. The release does not appear to use any unjustifiable language.",true,"Association/Society news release,Diagnostic tests"
271,29364,The U.S.'s leading group of pediatricians issued a strong statement condemning tolerance of gender dysphoria in children.,"May 20, 2016","What's true: The American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds), a small and politically-motivated group, issued a statement about their beliefs on children and gender identity. What's false: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) did not issue such a statement, nor do the United States' ""leading pediatricians"" (or even a majority of pediatricians) concur with the ACPeds' position.",Kim LaCapria,"On 16 May 2016, talk show host Glenn Beck published a tweet reporting that a pediatricians’ group had said that promoting or tolerating gender dysphoria (i.e., the condition of feeling one’s emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite of one’s biological sex) in children constitutes “child abuse”: American College of Pediatricians: Promoting Gender Dysphoria Ideology Is ‘Child Abuse’ https://t.co/5yoPFk2H2u — Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) May 16, 2016  Beck’s tweet led many viewers to believe that the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) had taken that stance on childhood gender dysphoria, but the tweet linked to an article containing quotes from the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) not the AAP: The American College of Pediatricians recently issued a temporary position statement on so-called gender identity disorder, or gender dysphoria. A full statement will be issued this summer. The temporary statement is prefaced with the following: The American College of Pediatricians urges educators and legislators to reject all policies that condition children to accept as normal a life of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex. Facts —  not ideology — determine reality. “They say human sexuality is an objective, biological, binary trait, XY and XX are genetic marks of health, not genetic markers of disorders,” Co-host Pat Gray said on The Glenn Beck Program. “Now that seems to fit in with what, kind of, the politically correct crowd is saying right now, that gender is just a state of mind.” ACPeds is a very small group formed relatively recently in response to political disagreements over same-sex parenting, not out of any specific focus on pediatrics or the wellness of children (and the organization is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center). By ACPeds’ own admission, their original aim was to promote parenting by heterosexual married couples: The Mission of the American College of Pediatricians is to enable all children to reach their optimal physical and emotional health and well-being. To this end, we recognize the basic father-mother family unit, within the context of marriage, to be the optimal setting for childhood development, but pledge our support to all children, regardless of their circumstances. The American College of Pediatricians promotes a society where all children, from the moment of their conception, are valued unselfishly. We encourage mothers, fathers and families to advance the needs of their children above their own. We expect societal forces to support the two-parent, father-mother family unit and provide for children role models of ethical character and responsible behavior. Beck’s material linked to a previous statement issued by ACPeds (“Gender Ideology Harms Children”) that some social media users confused with a study. The statement opened with the portion Beck excerpted before issuing an eight-point initial platform on gender identity in children, which stated (among other things) that human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait, puberty-blocking hormones can be dangerous, and that rates of suicide are twenty times greater among adults who use cross-sex hormones and undergo sex reassignment surgery. The statement provided citations for its claims, including references to seemingly conflicting information from the respected American Psychiatric Association’s “Gender Dysphoria Fact Sheet”: In the upcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with will be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. This diagnosis is a revision of DSM-IV’s criteria for gender identity disorder and is intended to better characterize the experiences of affected children, adolescents, and adults … DSM-5 aims to avoid stigma and ensure clinical care for individuals who see and feel themselves to be a different gender than their assigned gender. It replaces the diagnostic name “gender identity disorder” with “gender dysphoria,” as well as makes other important clarifications in the criteria. It is important to note that gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.” The APA’s position is that gender dysphoria is “not in itself a mental disorder,”  and that children are a demographic group at risk for compromised clinical care. A part of ACPeds’ citation that bordered on deceptive was the fact that the American Psychiatric Association’s fact sheet discussed changes to diagnostic criteria implemented around 2013, but ACPeds went on to cite studies that were typically more than a decade old and in direct conflict with medical science directives issued several years (and several studies) later. A September 2015 presentation from the American Academy of Pediatrics notes that treatment recommendations are based on the best available evidence. Their guidance defined three approaches to gender dysphoria in children: “corrective,” “supporting,” and “affirming,” with the AAP advising the “affirming” approach to gender dysphoria in children:    In February 2016, the AAP (not ACPeds) published a number of studies and articles about gender identity and pediatrics, including findings that acceptance of gender identity is associated with low risk of depression and anxiety in dysphoric pediatric patients. One AAP article referenced research indicating that familial support and acceptance correlates strongly with positive mental health outcomes: The study, “Mental Health of Transgender Children Who are Supported in Their Identities,” in the March 2016 issue of Pediatrics (published online on Feb. 26) presents new research on the positive mental health outcomes of prepubescent transgender children who socially transition, or begin to live expressing their gender identities. Researchers found that children allowed to exhibit their gender, by changing their names, clothing, pronoun use, and hairstyles, had normal levels of depression, and anxiety levels only slightly above their peers. The study compares a national sample of 73 transgender prepubescent children, ages 3 to 12, with 49 of their siblings and a control group of 73 “typically developing” children of the same ages. While previous research has shown that gender nonconforming youth often have elevated rates of depression and anxiety, this study suggests that familial support can be associated with good mental health outcomes among transgender children. The study authors suggest that further research will be important to evaluate the mental health of transgender children as they move into adolescence. The cited study’s conclusion [PDF] again demonstrated evidence in direct conflict with ACPeds’ assertions: Socially transitioned transgender children who are supported in their gender identity have developmentally normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations in anxiety, suggesting that psychopathology is not inevitable within this group. Especially striking is the comparison with reports of children with GID; socially transitioned transgender children have notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among children with GID living as their natal sex. On 20 April 2016, the AAP formally called for the repeal of recent bathroom bills aimed at preventing transgender individuals (including children) from using the facilities which matched their gender identity. A larger March 2016 study published by the AAP assessed best practices in treating dysphoric patients. ACPeds and the AAP are vastly different groups. The former has an estimated membership of between 60 and 200 pediatricians, while about 64,000 such physicians are aligned with the AAP. ACPeds also explicitly states a mission that is overtly political rather than medical in nature. The “gender ideology” statement wasn’t ACPeds’ first effort to mislead parents. In January 2016, the group issued a statement riddled with false and dangerous information about the HPV vaccine Gardasil.",false,"Medical, american college of pediatricians, gender dysphoria, not actually a study"
275,8984,Older patients with knee pain may benefit from allograft transplant technique,"July 10, 2018","The news release focuses on a small-scale study comparing the outcomes of osteochondral allograft transplantation — a technique that replaces damaged knee cartilage with healthy cartilage from a donor. The researchers used the technique to treat knee pain in two groups of patients: those over the age of forty and those under the age of forty. Specifically, the release reports that osteochondral allograft transplantation — sometimes in conjunction with additional surgery — can be an effective treatment for older adults. However, the release offers little detailed information. For example, it fails to address costs, potential harms, or quantified benefits related to the procedure. It also didn’t explain that the control group used in the study wasn’t really adequate to demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure. Knee pain is a common complaint that increases with age. In older individuals, symptoms are often related to arthritis due to “wear and tear” over time. Problems with the cartilage that covers the bone are thought to be a common factor that contributes to these arthritic changes. If the cartilage is lost in certain places, the result is bone on bone irritation without the protective surface that the cartilage provides. There are many causes for developing cartilage defects, but one is prior knee surgery, commonly arthroscopic (“scope”) procedures done to repair tears in the pad (meniscus) that cushion the knee bones. That is why most patients in this study had a history of prior surgery. Treatment for cartilage damage has focused on ways to regrow it so that the defects can be repaired. This study reports on one such procedure. The key issue evaluated here is the age of the patient. This is important because with increasing age the cartilage problems get worse and don’t respond to repair attempts. So studies demonstrating similar benefit in older compared to younger patients may be important. But it is also important to know that even in younger patients, such techniques haven’t been shown in high quality studies to really work, especially in longer-term follow-up studies. Thus saying that outcomes were similar in younger and older patients may mislead readers by overlooking the generally limited evidence of success, especially over time, in younger patients.","Matt Shipman,Steven J. Atlas, MD, MPH,Kevin Lomangino","Costs are not addressed at all. A 2007 article from Orthopedics Today estimated the cost of an allograft at approximately $10,000. The relevant cost may have gone up or down in the intervening years, but is likely still considerable — and well worth mentioning. Benefits are not quantified at all. The release refers only to “statistically significant improvement” for IKDC and “all five KOOS sub-scores.” The release does not tell readers what “statistically significant improvement” means, nor do they explain what IKDC or KOOS stand for — much less what the various sub-scores are. We assume from the language in the release that it is intended largely for an expert audience. However, news releases are ultimately aimed at reporters — that’s what makes them news releases. While some reporters may be familiar with IKDC or KOOS, many reporters (even very good ones) are not. It would be more than worthwhile to include a few additional sentences articulating what the scores are, what the relevant numerical benefits were, and why the researchers deemed the changes in these scores to be important. Potential harms are not discussed at all. No surgery is completely without risks, so this is not an acceptable oversight. For example, as of 2007, Orthopedics Today was still highlighting the fact that “Disease transmission also remains a worry for surgeons using allografts.” The release is so concise, we aren’t really sure what is being done. It appears that the genesis of the study is that this procedure works in younger patients and now the question is whether it works in older ones. But as noted above, the effectiveness of this procedure in younger patients hasn’t been conclusively demonstrated. So the control group of younger patients is problematic for making comparisons. Also left out is the real question of whether this treatment in older patients results in better outcomes compared to a sham or placebo treatment or another active treatment. That would be the control group that could allow for a meaningful assessment of benefit. For all intents and purposes, there is no real control group of similar patients (based upon age here) who were randomly assigned to receive a different treatment. Another problem is that the release misstates the number of patients involved. The release refers to 80 patients — 38 in the study group and 42 in the control group. The abstract for the relevant study says that there were 33 patients in the study group and 35 in the control group, for a total of 68 patients. A difference of 12 patients may not be hugely significant in a large study, but a cohort of 68 patients is 15 percent smaller than a cohort of 80. It’s problematic to make a mistake on a point as basic as this one. There was no disease mongering. However, the story also doesn’t provide any context on what this procedure is supposed to treat or the impact of that condition. We’ll rate this Not Applicable. The release does not say how the research was funded, nor does it address conflicts of interest. To be clear, the research may have been internally funded, and there may well be no conflicts of interest — but it’s important for a release to state that explicitly. Other techniques for addressing knee pain, including oral medications, injectable medications, physical therapy, and other surgical treatment options, are not mentioned. It is not clear from the release how or why osteochondral allograft transplantation may be more advantageous than other options. The release notes that “osteochondral allograft transplantation has traditionally been used in younger active patients with cartilage disorders.” Readers can infer from this that the technique is already available, although it may not be available everywhere and not all insurers will cover these procedures. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of journal articles out there regarding the use of osteochondral allograft transplantation to address knee problems. What sets this one apart? Presumably it is the first to directly compare outcomes between older and younger adults, but the release doesn’t explicitly tell readers that. The release is very careful to use cautious language, such as noting in the headline that “older patients with knee pain may benefit” [emphasis added] from the relevant treatment technique.",false,knee arthritis
276,9565,Babies Should Eat Eggs and Peanuts Early to Avoid Food Allergies,"September 23, 2016","This is a brief story looking at a systematic review of 146 other studies, concluding that there is likely some reduction in risk of allergy to eggs and peanuts if infants get those foods for the first time between 4-6 months, instead of later. The review lends more evidence to the theory that some allergies can be avoided, paradoxically, by exposing children earlier to the allergen, such as peanuts or eggs. But this is not the final word, and the researchers make that clear in their review, stating, “these systematic review findings should not automatically lead to new recommendations to feed egg and peanut to all infants.” This viewpoint is missing from the TIME story, which headlined this story with a very conclusive statement: “Babies Should Eat Eggs and Peanuts Early to Avoid Food Allergies.”   Food allergies are common and on the rise in the U.S. Parents deserve more context and some of the caveats behind why the researchers caution against a blanket recommendation.","Sally James,Edward Ward, MD,Joy Victory","Cost does not apply to in this example of eating habits. However, the story would have been stronger with some context about how much money is spent on treating child food allergies. Even in this short story, we need some metric for measuring the benefit. The story says there was evidence that introducing peanuts earlier to infant diets provided a “risk reduction” of later allergy. How much of a risk reduction? Was the reduction similar between eggs and peanuts? The journal article itself gives some absolute risk numbers. For egg allergy, the study shows a reduction of 24 cases per 1,000 children. For peanut allergy, the risk is reduced by 18 cases per 1,000 children. But the authors warn that the “certainty of the evidence” was downgraded due to some gray areas in how the studies were done. According to the news release, the study authors say that we need “a careful assessment of the safety and acceptability of early egg and peanut introduction in different populations” before rolling this out widely. What are these safety concerns? The story doesn’t say. The story tells us this was a review of past studies including 146 total. It would have been better to describe the systematic review in more detail, including key limitations. For example, while the reviewers looked at 146 studies, they only had five studies that yielded the evidence for eggs and only two studies that yielded the evidence for peanuts. And, we think this viewpoint stressed in the study’s discussion section didn’t quite make it into the news story, which it should have: “These systematic review findings should not automatically lead to new recommendations to feed egg and peanut to all infants.” As we point out in our summary, this seems in direct conflict with the headline on the story (“Babies Should Eat Eggs and Peanuts Early to Avoid Food Allergies”). There was no disease mongering. The story quotes only one scientist, and that is his written comment from an editorial accompanying the study, not an interview. This source, Dr. Matthew Greenhawt, has a potential conflict of interest that wasn’t disclosed: He’s a member of the scientific advisory council for the National Peanut Board, among other affiliations clearly stated in the study’s editorial. This story does not seem to require comparison of alternatives, since it isn’t about treatments. The food items are widely available. The story establishes the novelty of the research here: “This is relatively new thinking. Not so long ago, in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that allergenic foods be kept away from infants until they were at least a year old, and often older. ..That advice has been amended, and newer evidence has shown that introducing foods earlier is actually better for preventing food allergies.” The story doesn’t offer much beyond the news release, but it doesn’t appear to use verbatim phrases or quotes.",false,"allergies,diet"
277,2418,Kettlebells swing to a full body workout.,"November 25, 2013","Few workout tools are more versatile than kettlebells, the ancient market counterweights that were hoisted by Russian strongmen and now can be found in weight rooms at gyms across the country, fitness experts say.",Dorene Internicola,"But kettlebells, which come in varying weights, are often thought mistakenly to be the preserve of strongmen and extreme athletes. Steve Cotter, a former Kung Fu competitor and the founder and director of the International Kettlebell and Fitness Federation, said part of the problem was that the kettlebell was marketed as a hard-core tool that implied intensity. “It prevents beginners from giving it a shot,” said Cotter in an interview. But the San Diego-based author of “Kettlebell Training: 95 exercises for strength, toning, stamina and weight loss,” said novices should not be deterred. “If you only have 30 minutes a day to commit to exercise, the kettlebell is an all-in-one, hand-held gym,” he said. The key to kettlebell training, Cotter added, is incremental progression. He recommends starting off with light weights, using one or two basic moves like the swing, during which the exerciser moves the kettlebell between the legs like a pendulum, forward and up and then back and down. Normal, healthy women might begin with an eight-kilogram (17.6-pound) kettlebell, he said, while men can start with 16-kilograms (35.2 pounds). “It sounds pretty heavy, but it’s not the same approach as a dumbbell because you’re swinging it, relying on inertia,” Cotter explained. “It’s more on the endurance side.”  Because the center of mass extends beyond the hand, the kettlebell allows for ballistic, or fast, swinging motions that combine cardio-respiratory, strength, and flexibility training. The result is an all-around, functional fitness workout that mimics everyday activities such as shoveling snow or working in the garden, he said. Amy Dixon, who teaches Kettlebell Power, a group class at an Equinox Fitness center in Los Angeles, said the workout is beneficial because it puts the body through so many ranges of motion. “Your body is completely integrated, so you’re moving everything,” said Dixon, the creator of “Raise Some Bell - The Ultimate Kettlebell Core Workout” DVD. She calls it “one of the best pieces of equipment that’s been around for centuries.”  For Richard Cotton, spokesman for the American College of Sports Medicine, the appeal of the kettlebell is its practicality. “Kettlebells are inexpensive. They don’t take up a lot of space, and they enable a variety of exercises,” Cotton said. Unlike free weights, which tend to be linear, kettlebells work across all planes, he explained. “I think they’re here to stay among a wide population ... I could even see senior kettlebell workouts, so long as they take it easy,” said Cotton, who advises people to progress slowly, starting with light weights. Cotter stresses that there’s nothing mystical about working with kettlebells. But lifting with the back is incorrect, he said. The back should be flat, with creasing at the hips. “There’s no boredom to it,” he said. “Every workout can be different, and it feels almost like dancing.”",true,Health News

281,1856,Eagle center struggles to supply American Indians rituals.,"April 25, 2012",A wildlife specialist splays the wings of a dead golden eagle shipped in from New Mexico and is pleased by what he sees.,Keith Coffman,"Dennis Wiist, Wildlife Repository Specialist, inspects the feathers around an eagle's foot at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Eagle Repository in Commerce City, Colorado March 26, 2012. REUTERS/Rick Wilking “This one is an awfully good bird,” Dennis Wiist of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says. “There’s not too much damage, which is extremely rare.”   Wiist will bag the eagle, freeze it and then have it delivered to a waiting Native American Indian tribe. Eagles are sacrosanct for many tribes, and Wiist and his colleagues at the National Eagle Repository provide them with feathers, wings and talons - and in some cases whole carcasses - for religious rituals. But the Indians’ demand outstrips the repository’s supply. Each year the repository receives about 2,300 dead bald and golden eagles, gathered by wildlife agents and others. But it gets more than 3,000 requests a year for whole birds or parts. There are some 6,000 entries on the waiting list. “We just don’t have the supply. Our inventory is stretched,” said Bernadette Atencio, supervisor of the program for the Fish and Wildlife Service. The repository, located about 10 miles from downtown Denver, was established in the 1970s to meet the needs of American Indians but some don’t want to rely on it because it can take so long to get a bird, even as the population of bald eagles has largely recovered from the threat of imminent extinction. Quality is another issue. The eagles sent to the repository can arrive in poor shape, sometimes little more than carrion and not suitable for rituals. On this particular day, Wiist removes a decayed golden eagle from a bag with a note attached saying the bird had been found in a water tank, which Wiist says rendered it useless. An adult bald eagle he examines next is in relatively good condition, with just a fractured ankle and some head trauma. It qualifies as a complete bird. The Northern Arapaho tribe of Wyoming requires a “religiously pure eagle” for its summer sun dance but spiritual leader Nelson White has said the repository has sent unsuitable decomposed eagles. In November, the tribe filed a federal lawsuit saying its religious rights were being violated by the eagle regulations. Last month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approved a so-called “take” permit allowing the tribe to kill two bald eagles for spiritual purposes. The tribe has since said it wants to negotiate with the government to kill more. The repository tries to meet the need for eagles, and Wiist evaluates 25 to 30 dead bald and golden eagles a day, holding their plumes to the light and meticulously inspecting them from head to talon, jotting down notes on each raptor’s overall condition. Eagle carcasses waiting to be shipped hang on racks in a walk-in freezer adjacent to Wiist’s work station. Bags of usable feathers line the walls. “I always check the wing bones to see if they’re broken or damaged,” Wiist said. “Some (Indians) use the wing bones for whistles.”   Micah Loma’omvaya, a Hopi anthropologist who works for the tribal government in Arizona, said his people see the eagle as a benevolent being that allows them to communicate with other deities. It also represents their ancestors’ spirits, he said. “Eagles are integral to everything we do,” Loma’omvaya said. “Not just for ceremonies, but offerings with eagle feathers are made for fertility, rain, hunting - everything good in life.”   Loma’omvaya, who says his people have used feathers ceremoniously since “time immemorial,” said repository birds sometimes did arrive in rough condition but that his overall experience had been positive. He said that, while Hopis are allowed permits to “take” live golden eagles, not having items from the repository would limit his ability to participate in certain cultural events. U.S. eagle populations once numbered in the hundreds of thousands but were decimated by encroaching human development, unfettered hunting and the pesticide DDT. The bald eagle, the national bird of the United States, dwindled to a mere 400 breeding pairs by the early 1960s. The Bald Eagle Protection Act of 1940, amended in 1962 to include golden eagles, was enacted by Congress to save them from extinction. Since federal protections were imposed to protect bald eagles, their population has soared to some 9,000 pairs, prompting their removal from endangered and threatened lists in 2007. Other federal laws still make it mostly illegal to kill eagles, and it is also illegal for anyone to possess eagle parts without a permit, Native American or otherwise. Meanwhile, some animal-rights groups are unhappy that the Northern Arapaho were granted the kill permit. Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, said allowing the killing of bald eagles was “unsettling” and could lead to a flurry of kill permit applications. Peter Reshetniak, director of the Colorado-based Raptor Education Foundation, denounced last month’s eagle killings as a “barbaric act” and said tribes could use molted feathers from live eagles in captivity.",true,Environment
285,33343,Wedding guests should refrain from throwing rice at newly-wedded couples because the rice kills birds who eat it.,"May 14, 2000",An old rumor warns that discarded rice eaten by birds can expand in their tiny birdy stomachs and kill them.,David Mikkelson,"We’re cautioned not to throw rice at the bride and groom, because the grain will prove harmful to the birds who swoop down to eat it. The rice expands in those little birdy stomachs, causing our avian companions to explode, we’re warned. This rumor was so pervasive, that in 1985 a Connecticut state legislator introduced a bill (amusingly titled “An Act Prohibiting the Use of Uncooked Rice at Nuptial Affairs”) to outlaw the practice:  Saying it isn’t healthy for birds, a state legislator has proposed a bill that would ban the traditional showering of newlyweds with uncooked rice at weddings in Connecticut. “An Act Prohibiting The Use Of Uncooked Rice At Nuptial Affairs” would provide that “no person shall throw, fling, cast or hurl any uncooked rice at any time during the celebration of any marriage,” according to Rep. Mae S. Schmidle’s proposal. The “statement of purpose” of the Newtown Republican’s bill says it would “prevent injury and death of birds as a result of ingesting raw rice thrown at weddings.” “The rice that’s left, that’s not in your hair or on your suit or in your bouquet, you leave for the birds,” she explained. “Unfortunately, when the birds eat the raw rice, they cannot digest it. When it gets in their stomachs, it expands and causes them to have violent deaths. I’ve heard from several ministers who say that the next morning after a wedding, they see all these birds toppled over because they got poisoned by the rice,” Mrs. Schmidle said. Her bill would impose a $50 fine for anyone caught throwing rice at a wedding. However, local ornithologists said that they had never heard of or seen birds dying after consuming rice thrown at weddings:  Although she said the Audubon Society thinks the idea “is wonderful,” a check with three Connecticut Audubon members produced no such assessment of the idea. “It sounds crazy,” said Roland C. Clement of Norwalk, a past president of the Connecticut Audubon Society and currently president of the Connecticut Ornithological Association. “I have 50 years of professional experience as a practicing ornithologist and I’ve never heard of such a thing before. Of course, there can always be a first time, but I would have to see some evidence before I would promote the idea.” Asked if he thought it was possible that birds would be killed by raw rice, Clement said: “I personally doubt it.” Karl Wagener, a former top official with the Connecticut Audubon Society who now heads the state Council on Environmental Quality, also questioned the need for Mrs. Schmidle’s bill. “I’ve never heard of anything like that ever, and I read an awful lot of bird-oriented literature,” he said. David Emerson, assistant director of the Connecticut Audubon Society, said the topic had never come up in any discussions he knew of within the society. “This silly myth pops up periodically, and it is absolutely unfounded,” responded rice expert Mary Jo Cheesman at the USA Rice Federation. Many migrating ducks and geese depend on winter-flooded rice fields each year to fatten up and build strength for their return trek to northern nesting grounds. Uncooked, milled rice is no more harmful to birds than rice in the field, Cheesman said. The Curator of Ornithology at the University of California at Berkeley agrees. “It’s a myth. There is no reason why birds, including small songbirds, can’t eat rice,” said Ned Johnson, a professor of biology at Berkeley who lectures frequently on the food and feeding of birds. Ann printed a response from one New York ornithologist who took her to task for spreading misinformation:  I am writing in response to a letter and your answer that appeared in the Ithaca Journal recently. There is absolutely no truth to the belief that rice (even instant) can kill birds. This rumor received publicity because of a bill introduced into the Connecticut legislature in 1985 by Mae Schmidle. This wild story resulted in frightening thousands of brides into putting birdseed in little tulle and chiffon bags so the guests wouldn’t throw rice and “kill the birds.” Rice is no threat to birds. It must be boiled before it will expand. Furthermore, all the food that birds swallow is ground up by powerful muscles and grit in their gizzards. Many birds love rice, as any frustrated rice farmer will tell you. I hope you will print this information in your column and put an end to this myth. In the meantime, keep throwing rice, folks. Tradition will be served and the birds will eat well and be healthy. Steven C. Sibley, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, N.Y. Dear Steven Sibley: Your letter proves once again that if a story is repeated often enough, people will believe it, even though it is false and defies logic. We checked with an authority in the Bird House at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, and she verified your statement. Shame on me for going along with that crock. I feel like a birdbrain. As noted in those responses to Ann Landers’ spreading of this rumor, plenty of wild birds eat naturally growing, uncooked rice without suffering death or any other harmful effects. The notion that rice absorbs moisture, and would therefore swell up to many times its original size in the crop of a bird and thereby rupture avians from within, is a mistaken one based upon our  culinary experiences with rice. We typically boil rice prior to eating it, and rice grains do absorb a fair amount of moisture during that process. But otherwise rice absorbs moisture only very slowly, and the interior of birds is not nearly as hot nor as moisture-suffused as a pot of boiling water — any uncooked rice eaten by birds is digested or excreted long before it can pick up enough water to expand in size to the point of causing injury to them. Still, nothing satisfies curious minds like empirical evidence, so in 2002 University of Kentucky biology professor James Krupa put the matter to test with his students, conducting experiments that he eventually published in the April 2005 edition of the journal American Biology Teacher under the title “A CLASSROOM EXERCISE FOR TESTING URBAN MYTH: Does Wedding Rice Cause Birds to Explode or Were Ann Landers, Martha Stewart & Bart Simpson Wrong?” One factor Krupa and his students measured just how much rice actually expands when soaked in water. They found that soaked white rice expanded in volume by 33%, which might sound like a lot, but not so much when compared to ordinary bird seed, which they found increased in size by an even greater percentage (40%). If a 33% increase in volume of ingested rice could cause birds to explode, then bird seed should be turning even more of them into avian bombs. Krupa’s group found that instant rice, both the brown and white varieties, expanded considerably more (2.4 to 2.7 times its original volume) than plain white rice when soaked. Instant rice isn’t typically the sort that people throw at weddings (because it’s costlier and more difficult to buy in bulk), but nonetheless the experimenters tested the possibilities by constructing models of bird crops from thin plastic and wet paper and filling them with instant rice. Although a paper bag filled with soaked instant white rice ruptured in about 15 minutes, none of the avian crop models burst. Krupa’s students prevailed upon him to also test the exploding rice theory on real birds, an entreaty he finally acquiesced to because he felt their previous experiments had sufficiently demonstrated that no birds would come to harm through the process. He agreed to try some rice-feeding tests with flocks of doves and pigeons he kept at home, feeding 60 of his birds a diet of nothing other than instant rice and water for one day and monitoring them for any ill effects. He found that none of the birds showed any obvious signs of pain, discomfort, or distress; none of them exhibited ruptures or other injuries (including explosion), and none of them took ill or died. Many churches and reception halls still have rules prohibiting the throwing of rice, or require that thrown rice be enclosed in those “little tulle and chiffon bags.” This practice isn’t about protecting birds, however: these rules work to keep the properties clean so that subsequent happy couples don’t get their send-offs amid the leavings of a previous pair. Rice and confetti can be notoriously hard to clean up, and sometimes not even vacuuming a lawn will return the grass to its pristine condition. Rice also poses a unique danger, albeit it to people rather than birds: rice scattered on a hard surface (such as the steps of a church or a dance floor) puts anyone who walks across that surface at risk of taking a nasty spill. Far better to prohibit rice throwing at a wedding than to end up with an injured guest. Don’t do it for the birds, do it for the inlaws. Sightings:   In The Simpsons episode of 14 May 2000, Bart is warned not to throw rice at Otto’s wedding, lest he cause birds to explode. Also, in the 16 July 2001 episode of the TV soap opera Passions Charity told Tabitha that they don’t throw rice at weddings anymore, stating this legend’s premise as the reason. And in an episode of the TV sitcom Cybill (“Bachelor Party,” original air date 6 January 1997), Holly (Ira’s fiancée) dictates that rice won’t be thrown at her wedding because it “makes pigeons explode.”",false,"Critter Country, birds, Crusader Habit, Wild Inaccuracies"
287,2917,FDA approves AstraZeneca type 2 diabetes drug.,"January 8, 2014",U.S. health regulators on Wednesday approved an AstraZeneca drug from a new class of medicines to treat type 2 diabetes after previously rejecting it over safety concerns.,Bill Berkrot,"The Food and Drug Administration’s approval had been expected after an outside advisory panel of medical experts voted by a wide margin in December to recommend its approval, saying the benefits of the drug, dapagliflozin, outweighed its safety risks. It will be sold in the United States under the brand name Farxiga. The medicine was co-developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca late last year bought out Bristol’s stake in their diabetes joint venture for more than $4 billion, including upfront and sales-related milestone payments. Farxiga, which has already been available in Europe, belongs to a class of diabetes drugs called SGLT-2 inhibitors that work by blocking reabsorption of glucose by the kidney and increasing its excretion through urine to lower levels of blood sugar. It will compete with a similar drug from Johnson & Johnson called Invokana, as well as diabetes medicines from other classes. Other drugmakers, including Boehringer Ingelheim, are also developing SGLT2 inhibitors. “We’re big believers in SGLT-2 class. It’s going to be a pretty big product,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, who forecast Farxiga annual sales reaching about $1.5 billion by 2018. Conover said the new class was underappreciated by investors and sees those drugs taking market share from some older diabetes treatments that cause weight gain. SGLT-2 inhibitors led to weight loss in clinical trials, which can be an attractive advantage because type 2 diabetes is closely associated with obesity. The potential market for type 2 diabetes treatments is enormous despite a crowded field with many medicines from several different classes from which to choose. An estimated 90 percent to 95 percent of the more than 370 million people living with diabetes worldwide have type 2, according to the International Diabetes Federation. Many type 2 diabetes patients require two or more medications to get their blood sugar down to target levels. Farxiga was tested in combination with several other widely used medicines. “Farxiga provides an additional treatment option for millions of Americans with type 2 diabetes,” Curtis Rosebraugh, of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. The FDA had initially rejected the Astra and Bristol-Myers drug in early 2012 over concerns about possible cancer and heart risks. The companies provided additional data that addressed those concerns to the satisfaction of the advisory panel and the agency. Still, as a condition of approval, the FDA is requiring six post-marketing studies, including a cardiovascular outcomes trial to make sure the medicine does not increase the risk of heart attacks in patients deemed at high risk of heart disease, and a study to assess bladder cancer risk. The FDA-approved label for Farxiga says the drug should not be used in patients who also have kidney disease or who are being treated for bladder cancer.",true,Health News

That’s what we thought, anyway, going into Sunday’s Golden Globes. We tuned in for the pre-show, with a beverage in one hand and our phone in the other. Our only care was coming up with snarky tweets about the rich and famous. Then Today host Matt Lauer had to go and kill our vibe with an apparently researched question for Kevin Spacey, who plays the conniving House Majority Whip Frank Underwood on Netflix’s House of Cards. ""You know, we were sitting together at breakfast, and we saw a fact,"" Lauer said, ticking us off because now we had to put our beverage down and give him our full attention. ""Do you know that the name Frank has risen in popularity by 20 percent since this show debuted? What does that say about parents across America?"" ""Well,"" Spacey said, ""if the parents also have last names that start with a ‘u,’ then, F.U. as initials has risen dramatically as well."" ""We are live, Kevin,"" Lauer said, fearing an expletive. ""Where’s that seven-second delay when you need it?"" joked co-host Savannah Guthrie. Spacey went on to have a pretty great night, winning his first Globe for Best Actor in a TV Series (Drama) for his role as Underwood. We still had work to do. We wanted to know if Lauer was for real about the name Frank taking a leap into popularity since the world was introduced to House of Cards (the third season premieres Feb. 27, 2015). What the numbers say We turned first to a super glamorous source: the Social Security Administration. The agency, which maintains a list of baby names going back to 1880, receives information on names from parents when they apply for a child’s Social Security number at his or her birth. Frank, a form of Francis as you would know from watching the show, used to be a really big name near the turn of the 20th century. From 1880 to 1892, it was the sixth-most popular name of U.S. males. It remained in the top 10 of baby names for boys until 1923, the year it started its long, slow slide to the 327th spot in 2013. The chart shows Frank was never more unpopular than in 2013, the same year subscription-based Netflix released the first season of House of Cards (Feb. 1, 2013, to be exact). The greater the ranking number, the lower the popularity of the name. Ranking of the male name Frank 2013 327 2012 319 2011 308 2010 302 2009 291 2008 278 2007 262 2006 246 2005 231 2004 230 2003 230 2002 216 2001 213 2000 208 1999 187 Source: Social Security Administration So Frank had become pretty unpopular before House of Cards started running. And now? This is where we have to introduce a major plot twist to this fact-check: The Social Security Administration has not yet released its 2014 data. The agency releases that information on the Friday before Mother’s Day in May. Without the last year’s data, we can’t discern if there was a possible increase -- much less what really drove it. We do, however, have an idea of what Lauer is talking about. BabyCenter.com, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, is a popular pregnancy and parenting website that releases an annual Baby Names Survey and Top 100 Names list. The names list is based on 406,000 babies born in 2014 to mothers who are registered BabyCenter users. BabyCenter global editor in chief Linda Murray hailed 2014 as the ""year of the binge-watching baby name"" because of the influence of TV shows that about 20 percent of surveyed moms said had on their baby name choice. The press release doesn’t just single out Frank, which saw a 19-percent increase from the 352nd ranking to No. 297 among BabyCenter users, but also House of Cards characters Claire (Frank’s wife, up 14 percent), journalist Zoe (up 13 percent), and lobbyist Remy (up 11 percent). Another Netflix show, Orange is the New Black, inspired a rash of baby-naming after characters from its female-centric cast, including Galina (up 67 percent), Nicky (up 35 percent), Piper (up 28 percent) and Dayanara (up 19 percent), BabyCenter says. To be clear, these increases are just the percentage that the names moved up the list from the year before. The BabyCenter survey doesn’t include information on how many people named their children Frank (or any other name) year by year. The naming effect is similar for characters in the Shonda Rhimes-produced shows Scandal (Olivia), Grey’s Anatomy (Meredith) and How To Get Away with Murder (Annalise), BabyCenter said, as well as the movie Frozen and its star Elsa. Murray called the correlation between trending baby names and binge-worthy shows ""undeniable."" Other experts weigh in That doesn’t mean we should take the word of BabyCenter as gold. Some of its user-generated  information mirrors federal name data, but there are discrepancies. BabyCenter’s most popular male name in 2013 was Jackson, and the federal winner was Noah. Sophia remained the most popular girl name according to both sources. For instance, the popularity of the name Frank varied pretty significantly when you compared BabyCenter and Social Security information from years past. (We looked so you didn’t have to.) Basically, experts say we need to wait for the Social Security Administration list to know for sure. It isn’t inconceivable that Frank or Francis is turning a corner after the popularity of House of Cards, said Laura Wattenberg, author of Baby Name Wizard and the website of the name. But it may also have to do with parents who want to honor Pope Francis (but don’t want to call their children Francis). ""It’s hard for one use to really move the needle,"" Wattenberg said. ""Frank has been so unpopular for so long that you could get what looks like a really big jump just from a couple dozen names."" Echoing Social Security’s 2013 press release about hot baby names, Wattenberg said the reality is that ""obscure"" Spanish TV shows are more likely to have the hottest name of the year than a Netflix hit. In 2013, the girl’s name Daleyza, the name of a young woman’s character on the Spanish-language show Larrymania, increased in popularity by more than 3,000 places. Who would do this Then we got curious about the name Frank itself. As Lauer prodded, what does naming a child after the murderous, conniving character say about American parents? Parents are ""desperate for fresh name ideas"" these days, and are not choosy about the source, Wattenberg said. Gone are the days when all-American parents name their offspring in tribute to the new president. ""They just want something that sounds fresh and creative,"" she said. ""That includes villains, video game characters."" Albert Mehrabian, professor emeritus of psychology at UCLA, wrote the books The Name Game and Baby Name Report Card based on his studies of the attractiveness of names. His studies aimed to capture the impressions left by names isolated from any other factor, such as appearance or personality. Participants in his studies were asked to imagine themselves meeting someone for the first time knowing just their first name, its spelling and the person’s gender. The participants gave numerical scores on a range of adjectives describing the name, and their responses were averaged and categorized into four areas that defined the name’s attractiveness -- ethical/caring, popular/fun, success and femininity/masculinity. The name Frank scored a 65 of 100 overall, doing really well in terms of giving a successful, ambitious impression but lacking substantially in ethics, Mehrabian said. (Sounds a lot like Spacey’s character, don’t you think?) The given name Francis, meanwhile, scores higher at 78 overall. The increase comes from the stronger impression of ethics and compassion for people named Francis, a score of 99 versus 22 for Frank. ""So Frank, I would say, it’s a so-so name,"" Mehrabian said. ""But it does have high implications of success."" A spokeswoman for Lauer’s Today show did not get back to us. Our ruling Lauer asked Spacey if he knew that ""the name Frank has risen in popularity by 20 percent"" since the debut of House of Cards in 2013.

But McAuliffe went an extra step and put words in the mouths of his opponents.",Sean Gorman,"Members of the Democratic state ticket gathered recently in Richmond for their first campaign rally an immediately labeled their Republican opponents as extremists. ""The Tea Party ticket says their top priority is a career-long mission to outlaw abortion in all cases and ban some common forms of birth control,"" Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, told a crowd of about 150 at the Hippodrome Theater in Jackson Ward. The claim caught our attention. There’s no doubt that the members of the GOP slate -- gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, lieutenant governor candidate E.W. Jackson and attorney general candidate Mark Obenshain -- are strongly opposed to abortion. But have they really said their No. 1 goal is to ban abortion and some forms of contraception? We asked McAuliffe’s campaign for proof and spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed to a comment Cuccinelli made at a February 2012 rally to support personhood legislation. The bill, which defined life as beginning at conception, had passed the House when Cuccinelli spoke but would subsequently die in the Senate. ""It’s hard to believe we actually have to come and advocate for something as basic as life, but we’ve had to do it for decades and we’re going to have to do it for the rest of our lives,"" The Washington Times quoted Cuccinelli as saying. ""The fight for life is going to last for all of our lives."" Schwerin cited various press reports and other materials saying the personhood measure would lead to a ban on all abortions and forms of birth control that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. But this Truth-O-Meter is not about the consequences of personhood legislation. We are examining whether the GOP ticket has proclaimed that ending abortion and certain types of contraception is its top priority. So Cuccinelli’s comments at the rally are immaterial. There are plenty of instances when members of the GOP ticket opposed abortion. Cuccinelli helped muscle through controversial new regulations that require clinics performing abortions to comply with building code standards for hospitals -- an action that was criticized as a ruse to force clinics to close. In a May 18 speech at the Republican state convention accepting the gubernatorial nomination, Cuccinelli called for ""defending those at both ends of life -- protecting the elderly from abuse as well as the unborn."" Jackson, the lieutenant governor nominee, has called abortion ""genocide."" And Obenshain, running for attorney general, has consistently voted to restrict abortion rights during his nine years in the state Senate. But when it comes to identifying the most important issue facing voters this fall, Cuccinelli has said it’s the economy. He was asked in a Jan. 3 radio interview on The John Fredericks Show how a Cuccinelli administration would differ from current GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell. ""In some ways it would be very similar,"" Cuccinelli replied. ""Certainly the same top priority of focusing on economic opportunity would be the same in a Cuccinelli administration."" And in a May 7 news conference announcing his tax plan, Cuccinelli said ""as governor, job creation will be my top priority."" We asked McAuliffe’s spokesman if he had any other evidence that Cuccinelli and his running mates have stated that ending abortions and restricting birth control are their main reasons for running this year. Schwerin pointed to comments Cuccinelli made last September during a visit to Prison Fellowship, a Lansdowne-based ministry. ""Start with the priorities. Work your way down: life, family, community, world -- a lot of ways to affect the ones at the bottom,"" Cuccinelli said. ""It gets narrower and narrower as you get to the top. None of those other rights matter a whole lot if you don’t get born."" Schwerin provided another snippet of a clip, this one from Cuccinelli’s appearance at a June 2011 conference of homeschoolers in Herndon. ""And that’s where the candidate’s responsibility arises. You give a campaign purpose. My purpose was to fight abortion, to shrink government, to protect life and families,"" Cuccinelli said. That establishes once again that one of Cuccinelli’s key reasons for entering politics is to oppose abortion. But it falls short of a declaration by the GOP ticket of its No. 1 goal. Our ruling McAuliffe claimed the GOP ticket ""says their top priority is a career-long mission to outlaw abortion in all cases and ban some common forms of birth control."" A compelling argument can be made that members of the GOP ticket will do everything possible to restrict abortions and those actions could ban certain types of birth control.

And while Hillary Clinton can’t take full credit, outsiders said she did set the overall direction for how the program should move forward and intervened in specific ways to help it do more at a lower cost.",Jon Greenberg,"When Bill Clinton wasn’t retelling how he courted his wife, he filled his Democratic convention speech, later published on Medium, with a long list of Hillary Clinton’s achievements in public life. When he got to her time as secretary of state, he applauded her work on HIV/AIDS. ""She tripled the number of people with AIDS in four countries whose lives are being saved with your tax dollars,"" Clinton said. ""Most of them in Africa, going from 1.7 million lives to 5.1 million lives, and it did not cost you any more money. She just bought available FDA-approved generic drugs."" We decided to take a closer look at those treatment gains and the price tag that came with them. Clinton’s statement is a bit unclear, first referencing a tripling in four countries, then giving the top-line treatment numbers that span many nations. We reached out to Clinton’s office for clarification. His staff told us that Clinton was talking about the overall HIV/AIDS treatment activities of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. We took his essential claim to be that thanks to his wife, treatment tripled and costs held steady. That’s not perfectly accurate, but it's close. PEPFAR started under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama kept it going. Hillary Clinton can take some credit for PEPFAR’s achievements because it is a State Department program. One of PEPFAR’s major goals is to get as many people as possible into treatment, primarily in Africa but on other continents, too. There is no cure for AIDS, still, antiretroviral drugs can slow down the HIV virus in the body, sometimes for many years. In 2013, the Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress, looked at how efficiently PEPFAR was getting those antiretrovirals to people in need. That report backed up Clinton’s statement, but it only covered the years between 2005 and 2011. Here’s why that’s important. Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state from 2009 through January 2013. For a full view of what PEPFAR did on her watch, we got the numbers through 2012. Drawing on the GAO report, PEPFAR’s own reports, and numbers we got from PEPFAR staff, we found these trends: The charts tell us that the number of people in treatment rose from 2.1 million at the end of 2008 to 5.1 million by the end of 2012 (fiscal years). That number more than doubled, but it didn’t quite triple as Clinton said. However, that increase did come without additional tax dollars. Using constant 2009 dollars, treatment spending fell dramatically for two years, and then returned to the 2009 level. When you put the two trends together, the big picture is that the United States used the same amount of money to deliver about 250 percent more treatment. Eric Goosby, the head of PEPFAR during those years and now professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, said the George W. Bush administration laid the groundwork for those gains. ""It takes a lot time to find the places to set up treatment, and get all the pieces in place to deliver it,"" Goosby told us. ""We benefited from all of that."" But Goosby also points to the rapid shift to generic drugs after 2009. ""We went from buying 90 percent brand name antiretroviral drugs to less than 3 percent,"" Goosby said. The generic drugs were much cheaper. The program also cut costs by cutting out air delivery and moving goods by land and sea. ""This saved millions of dollars and allowed for an uninterrupted expansion of the number of patients on treatment,"" he said. The chart above shows that on Hillary Clinton’s watch, the costs per patient were driven down by more than half — from $673 when she took control to $338 when she left. The question is, does she deserve the credit? Mead Over, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a Washington policy center, urges a bit of caution. Over told us that while a lot of the work is done by State Department agencies, not all of it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health and other agencies also play a role. But at the end of the day, Over told us the secretary of state sets the priorities and in this case, the priority was to expand treatment at a lower cost per person. There's evidence that Clinton wasn't just phoning it in. AIDS activists counted her as an ally. Mark Harrington, executive director of the Treatment Action Group, a New York-based advocacy organization, said he would give Clinton a lot of credit for what happened. Harrington said she built stronger reporting ties with PEPFAR than her predecesor and had a clear picture of what was needed. Harrington gave one example of how that led to her direct involvement. ""She helped clear the way for the switch from using expensive international NGOs to deliver services, to working with in-country partners and ministries of health,"" Harrington said. ""There was a concern about corruption, and she made it very clear to foreign leaders that that could not happen. And it’s really surprising for a program this big that it hasn’t."" Harrington also noted that Clinton was engaged with HIV/AIDS before she became secretary. When she was in the Senate, she met with activists and advocated for the programs and funds they sought. Our ruling Bill Clinton said when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, she tripled the number of people with AIDS whose ""lives are being saved,"" and it didn’t cost taxpayers any more money. Clinton took some liberties with the numbers. Treatment rose rapidly by about 250 percent. That’s not quite triple. But Clinton was right that those gains came without additional spending in inflation-adjusted dollars. And while Hillary Clinton can’t take full credit, outsiders said she did set the overall direction for how the program should move forward and intervened in specific ways to help it do more at a lower cost.",true,"Global News Service, Foreign Policy, Public Health, Bill Clinton, "
299,35908,"U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden supports ""defunding"" police agencies.","September 29, 2020","No, I don’t. […] I don’t want to defund police departments. I think they need more help, they need more assistance.",Jessica Lee,"Following a series of high-profile deaths of Black Americans while in police custody, a civil rights movement to call attention to systemic racism in U.S. law enforcement emerged as a key issue in the presidential race between Republican U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In their public responses, both campaigns stripped the nuance from what was a deep-rooted reckoning over American racism and police brutality. Biden tried to align himself with protesters’ calls for reforming the country’s criminal justice system without going into specifics as to how. Meanwhile, Trump attempted to convince voters his opponent would turn America into a place of lawlessness and destruction by removing or completely eliminating police officers from streets. “Biden has vowed to defund the police,” Trump said in conference call with supporters on Aug. 12, 2020. We should note here: local governments, not the president’s office, decide specific budgets for city, county, and state law-enforcement agencies, though the federal government can levy funding for agencies that meet its chosen requirements. Weeks after the unsubstantiated claim alleging a promise by Biden, the president again suggested without specific evidence that his opponent was essentially a Trojan horse for progressive activists who want to downsize or completely abolish police agencies. “If you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund police departments all across America,” Trump claimed, while accepting the Republican Party’s nomination in the race. (See a transcript of the whole speech here.) Below, we focused on those allegations by the president, considering their frequent appearance in Trump campaign advertisements before the November 2020 election. Snopes relied on evidence to confirm or deny whether Trump was correct — that Biden at one point said he supports “defunding” U.S. law enforcement agencies nationwide. First, let us define what “defund the police” means. Per The Associated Press: Supporters say it isn’t about eliminating police departments or stripping agencies of all of their money. They say it is time for the country to address systemic problems in policing in America and spend more on what communities across the U.S. need, like housing and education. Additionally, a writer for the Washington Post explained: [Advocates] want to redirect some funds now spent on police forces to items such as education, public health, housing and youth services. The idea is that low-income communities would become stronger — and less in need of police — if root problems were addressed. Under this concept, some police officers would be replaced with trained social workers or specialized response teams in an effort to let police focus on violent crime, not drug overdoses or homelessness. The theory is that police would be better positioned to deal with rapes and murders if they were not required to deal with other social ills that sometimes lead to community confrontations with police. Next, we analyzed media interviews, social media posts, and other statements by Biden’s campaign for any reference to the above-described concept — that he said he agrees with “defunding” police departments, or protesters’ calls to redirect funding from U.S. law-enforcement agencies to social services. In June, Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden’s campaign, told news reporters in a statement: As his criminal justice proposal made clear months ago, Vice President Biden does not believe that police should be defunded. […] Biden supports the urgent need for reform, including funding for public schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment separate from funding for policing, so that officers can focus on the job of policing. Around the same time, Biden said in an interview with CBS News:  No, I don’t support defunding the police. […] I support conditioning federal aid to police, based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness. And, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community. Then, in a July interview with activist Ady Barkan, the question surfaced again. Barkan asked Biden if he was open to reducing responsibility on law-enforcement agencies to maintain public safety, and, as a result, redirect existing police funding into social services, mental health counseling, and programs to help people access affordable housing. An edited version of the exchange circulated widely on social media, showing Biden agreeing with Barkan and supposedly providing the proof Trump supporters were seeking. But according to the Washington Post, which obtained a full video of the interview, that shortened version of the interview was misleading. The news outlet reported: [The edited] video does not include Biden adding that his response was not the same as “defunding all the police.” He also speaks about increasing funding for mental health, which is different from saying he would fund mental health aid out of redirected funds from the police. In effect, Biden appears to say he would condition aid on police reforms as an incentive on the one hand, while simultaneously providing additional resources for mental health, homelessness and other kinds of community support. (A Biden campaign aide confirms this is Biden’s position.) Later, in an August interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Biden reiterated that stance. Co-anchor Robin Roberts asked, “President Trump says that you want to defund the police. Do you?” Biden responded:",false,"Politics, Election 2020"

The Observer referred to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine. The three lead researchers for that study declared the Observer's version was wholly inaccurate. They found signs of dead brain cells and cerebrospinal fluid where it shouldn’t be. They never said that the virus liquefied brain cells.,Jon Greenberg,"A claim moving on the Web paints a horrific image of how the Zika virus can damage a fetus. ""Evidence Shows Zika Virus Turns Fetus Brains to Liquid"" blared the headline on the website Weekly Observer, which is based in England. At least two other websites ran similar stories April 3 and 4, 2016. The claim is completely wrong, and has the barest connection to any actual research. Seeing as it showed up in quick succession in Australia and the United Kingdom, we thought we should move quickly to squash it. The Weekly Observer piece has the gloss of authentic reporting. A recent study published by the New England Journal of Medicine shows that the Zika virus kills developing fetal brain cells. According to the doctors, the study was performed on a woman who got infected by the virus while she was 3 months pregnant. Her fetus was monitored through blood tests and MRIs, and the doctors watched as the baby’s brain was basically liquefied within 9 weeks. The woman underwent an abortion at 21 weeks. The Australia Network website was equally somber. In a (sic) recent research published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers tracked the development of a foetus whose mother contracted the virus on a trip to Central America, when she was 3 months pregnant. The blood tests and the magnetic resonance images showed that the virus was slowly turning the baby’s brain into liquid over a course of nine weeks. At 21 weeks the woman aborted the foetus. The New England Journal of Medicine did publish an article on March 30, 2016, about a 33-year-old Finnish woman who was with her husband in Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize in November 2015 when she was 11 weeks pregnant. Ultrasound examinations up until the 17th week of the pregnancy showed no abnormalities. That changed by the 19th week. Basic structures in the cranium were not as they should be. That combined with proof that the mother was infected with the Zika virus and a more detailed view using MRI led the parents to terminate the pregnancy at 21 weeks. An autopsy found Zika virus in the fetal brain tissue. Areas of the brain had dead cells and some that had begun to break down. But did the researchers say that the brain had been liquefied? ""This is absolutely NOT what we said,"" wrote Adre du Plessis, one of the lead authors and director of the Fetal Medicine Institute at the Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C. A second author, Rita Drigger, a professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, called the description a ""false interpretation"" of  the case. A third author, Olli Vapalahti at the Department of Virology at the University of Helsinki, Finland, told us some reporter might have misunderstood him during an interview. ""I may have tried to explain -- perhaps in too simple terms -- that there was thinning of the cortex and enlargement of the ventricles in the brain, meaning that some of the brain tissue had been replaced by cerebrospinal fluid,"" Vapalahti said. ""I can now see that this has emerged to some hype message which certainly I have not intended to deliver."" In other words, it wasn’t that brain tissue was turned to liquid. Rather, space where brain cells would normally be found contained fluid instead. In a conference call with reporters on March 30, du Plessis said the main point of the article was to caution doctors and parents that an extremely small head might not be the sole indicator of brain damage associated with the Zika virus. In this case, the brain was small but the head was still within the normal range. ""What this says is that the current criteria may be falsely reassuring,"" du Plessis said. Further, while the presence of the Zika virus in fetal brain tissue strongly indicated that the virus caused the harm, the researchers stopped short of saying this case proved a causal connection. Several news organizations, including the Washington Post, NBC News and Reuters, reported the story accurately. We reached out to the Weekly Observer and so far have not heard back. Our ruling The Weekly Observer and other websites said that researchers had found that the Zika virus turned a fetal brain into liquid. The Observer referred to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine. The three lead researchers for that study declared the Observer's version was wholly inaccurate. They found signs of dead brain cells and cerebrospinal fluid where it shouldn’t be. They never said that the virus liquefied brain cells. We rate this claim . Update (April 5, 2016): After we published, we heard from the staff of the Weekly Observer. Elise Bou Malham, chief content officer, emailed us, apologized for the mistake and explained that she had first seen the article on another website. ""In no way was it meant to 'stir fears' or promote any false claims,"" Malham said. ""We assure you the article was deleted as soon as we received your email. I offer my sincere apologies on behalf of the entire editorial team."" While the article was not deleted, it was eventually updated. The new version reads. ""Claims about Zika Virus Turning Fetus Brains to ‘Liquid’ Completely FALSE"" It then explains its original error. ""Earlier this week, The Weekly Observer aggregated an article from various sources online, saying that Zika Virus is responsible for turning Fetus brain into liquid.

Exhaustive data collected by the CDC at the start of the century supports her statement.

The correlation between the availability of guns and suicide rates, while not as exact across the nation, certainly existed in most other states. The nine states with the lowest household gun rates also had the lowest suicide rates. The ranking of states by their suicide rates barely has changed over the years. But the CDC has stopped surveying gun ownership in states, and nothing nearly as reliable has filled the void. A much smaller poll conducted in 2013 suggests the ranking of states by the percentage of  homes with guns hasn’t changed much either. And there’s no shortage of researchers, past and present, who have concluded there is a strong link between the presence of guns and suicides. Editor's Note: An earlier headline on this story misspelled Signer's first name.",Warren Fiske,"Former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who was gravely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting near Tucson, recently visited Virginia’s Capitol to push for tougher gun laws. She and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, launched a coalition that will seek ""common-sense solutions"" to gun violence in the state. High on its list is convincing a resistant General Assembly to close loopholes in Virginia’s background check law for prospective gun buyers. About a dozen community leaders and law-enforcement experts met with Giffords and Kelly to help set strategies. Among them was Mira Signer, executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She said the availability of guns poses special risks to those with mental disorders. States ""that have the highest gun ownership also have the highest suicide rates,"" she said. ""The evidence is there. We know that."" We wondered whether Signer’s statement is correct. Signer told us her claim is based in part on a report called ""The Truth About Guns and Suicide,"" published in September 2015 by the Brady Center & Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonprofit advocating gun control. The report says, ""Studies examining firearm ownership and suicide rates at the national, state and regional levels provide further evidence of the firearm-suicide connection. They show that suicide rates, both overall and by firearm, are higher in areas where gun ownership is more widespread."" Footnotes in the report say the Brady Center’s statement is based on a series of studies by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center in Massachusetts - the last published in 2008. Researchers compared data that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention kept from 2000 to 2002 on the number of suicides in each state and the percentage of households in each state where at least one firearm was held. ""Among men, among women, and in every age group (including children), states with the higher rates of household gun ownership had higher rates of firearm suicides and overall suicides,"" the researchers wrote in an article published by The New England Journal of Medicine. Back then Why rely today on statistics that are more than decade old? Researchers say they’re still the best numbers available. Every year, the CDC conducts an extensive health-risk poll with more than 250,000 U.S. adults that ‘s called the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. It used to ask participants whether they had guns in their homes. With its huge sample, the results could be broken down to statistically reliable percentages of households with a gun in each state. The CDC, under congressional demands to stop researching gun issues, removed the question from the survey after 2004. Since then, no other poll has offered a reliable, detailed look at gun ownership rates in each state. The CDC surveys showed that the top three states for percentage of household gun ownership - Wyoming, Montana and Alaska - often ranked as the three states with the highest suicide rates. Roughly 60 percent of households held firearms in those states, much higher than the national median of 40 percent. Their suicide rates, according to other CDC data, hovered around 20 people per 100,000 - nearly double the national average of about 11 per 100,000. Conversely, the nine states with the lowest per-household gun ownership from 2001 to 2004 also had the nine lowest suicide rates. They were Hawaii, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, California, Illinois and Maryland. Overall, the statistics show a distinct correlation between gun ownership and suicide rates in states. There are, of course, anomalies. Nevada, for example, ranked 36th in the percentage of households with guns from 2001 to 2004 but had fourth-highest suicide rate. Virginia, if you’re wondering, ranked 32nd in the percentage of household with guns and 34th in suicide rate during that period. Today Signer’s statement was made in present tense, so there’s an issue of whether these old findings remain relevant. The ranking of states based on suicide rates barely has changed over the years, according CDC data for 2013 - the latest final statistics available. Wyoming, Alaska and Montana still had the highest rates. So that leaves the problem on quantifying household gun ownership in each state without updated, exhaustive surveys from the CDC. YouGov, an international market research firm, conducted an Internet poll in 2013 that asked 4,622 U.S. adults to participate in an online survey that asked whether they owned guns. YouGov broke the numbers down by state and got results that broadly resembled the CDC figures. Columbia University researchers used those figures in a 2013 paper on the gun culture in states and regions around the U.S. Bindu Kalesan, the lead researcher, told us in an email that the numbers for many states have a high margin of error. Many analysts, in exploring a variety of gun issues, still cite the CDC state figures. David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, told us the numbers still are relevant. ""Gun ownership levels across states hardly change over time,"" he said. ""For example, the best predictors of whether you will own a gun is whether you grew up with guns and whether your neighbors are gun owners or not."" These indicators, Hemenway said, ""don’t switch back and forth."" Hemenway sent us four studies from other researchers that also connected the presence of guns to high suicide rates. ""It all makes sense psychologically,"" he said, ""since so many suicides are pretty spontaneous with little planning and people use whatever is handy. The urge passes and people who have survived even serious suicide attempts rarely go on to kill themselves. The case fatality rate for guns is 90 percent, while the case fatality rate for the two most common forms of suicide attempts - pills and cutting - is under 3 percent."" Our ruling Signer said states that have ""the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates."" Exhaustive data collected by the CDC at the start of the century supports her statement. The three states with the highest percentage of household gun ownership - Alaska, Wyoming and Montana - also had the three highest suicide rates. The correlation between the availability of guns and suicide rates, while not as exact across the nation, certainly existed in most other states. The nine states with the lowest household gun rates also had the lowest suicide rates. The ranking of states by their suicide rates barely has changed over the years.

""People are starting to enter ERs with fungal lung infections from wearing masks!! Take breaks from your masks."" The claim, posted on July 2, had been shared 16,000 times and viewed nearly 700,000 times over the past 24 hours. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook). With more states requiring face coverings in public settings, and lots of  claims spreading about masks, we wanted to know whether there’s any truth to this provocative statement. We set out on a fact check. Misinformation About Masks This is far from the first social media post to claim that wearing masks is harmful to your health. In June, PolitiFact National debunked the multi-part allegation that claimed wearing masks for the coronavirus ""decreases oxygen intake, increases toxin inhalation, shuts down immune system"" and ""increases virus risk."" It rated the claim . In May, PolitiFact rated  a similar claim that wearing a mask causes health problems, particularly from breathing in too much exhaled carbon dioxide. It found there’s no credible data to back that up. ""Experts say prolonged use of N95 respirator masks can increase blood CO2 levels for people with breathing problems, but those masks are not recommended for the general public, and using ordinary cloth or surgical masks poses little or no risk from CO2,"" PolitiFact reported. Fungal Infections? With those fact checks in mind, we examined whether people are truly showing up at ERs with fungal lung infections due to wearing masks. We reached out to regional, statewide and national experts and found no supporting evidence. ""Neither the chair of our emergency department nor the head of our infectious diseases division have seen that type of condition in a patient after an individual has been using a face mask,"" a spokesperson for UC Davis Health in Sacramento wrote in an email. After looking into the claim, Elena Lopez-Gusman, executive director of the California chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians, called it ""as suspected, ."" Finally, the national American College of Emergency Physicians told us they’ve seen no evidence supporting the claim. ""While we’ve heard some folks complain about irritation, we have not heard of reports of fungal infections stemming from masks,"" Maggie McGillick, a spokesperson for ACEP wrote in an email. ""There are several professions where people wear masks for hours on end without issue."" The College released a statement last week encouraging people to cover their face when in public. ‘Recycled breathing’ not a real danger Taking a closer look at the Facebook post in question, some commenters wondered whether wearing a mask for hours on end might be harmful, while wearing it for just a short while might not be. In an email, McGillick of ACEP addressed that concern: ""There is not a real danger to breathing in your own air or ‘recycled breathing,’ nor is the idea of low oxygen or carbon dioxide buildup a concern. However, there could be risk from someone’s mask getting contaminated from others and then transferring that to your mouth/eyes/etc. when you touch your own mask."" The spokesperson stressed that it’s important to avoid touching your face and to wash your hands before and after touching your mask. Some commenters on the Facebook post in question said they worried about the health effects of wearing masks. Yet others said they were skeptical of the claim given that doctors, nurses, mechanics and others wear masks for a prolonged period and don’t come down with fungal lung infections. One medical professional jumped into the comments with her own fact check: ""It isn’t happening. I’m an ER nurse. This is not true at all."" Sanitary Tips For Mask Wearing Earlier this month, the health information website MedicalNewsToday fact-checked a similar claim and found there ""is no evidence indicating that masks increase the wearer’s risk of developing pneumonia or other bacterial, viral, or fungal lung infections."" It also included guidance from leading health organizations for how to safely handle your mask. It found the World Health Organization acknowledges ""that if a person wears the same mask for a long time, microorganisms may grow on the fabric."" ""All masks should be changed if wet or visibly soiled; a wet mask should not be worn for an extended period of time. ... Either discard the mask or place it in a sealable bag where it is kept until it can be washed and cleaned,"" the WHO advises. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends ""that a person removes the face covering once they return home and washes it before using it again,"" the MedicalNewsToday article also noted. Our ruling A popular Facebook post alleges people are checking into ERs with fungal lung infections due to wearing masks to prevent the coronavirus. Regional, statewide and national emergency physicians groups said there’s no evidence to back up this claim. Medical experts recommend wearing face coverings to slow the transmission of COVID-19 and say the effects of wearing the coverings are not harmful.

During World War II, Martha Raye joined with actresses Carole Landis, Kay Francis, and Mitzi Mayfair to form a United Service Organizations (USO) troupe, performing shows — often under difficult and dangerous conditions — for U.S. soldiers across Europe, the South Pacific, and North Africa. (All four women later starred in Four Jills in a Jeep, a cinematic account of their wartime USO experience. ): Example:   [Collected via e-mail, December 2010] Did you know that Martha Raye was a full bird Col in Army Reserve? Many may be too young to have known the comedian, Martha Raye. She was a loud mouth actress/comedian from several years ago, much unlike the foul mouthed four letter word spewing comics of today. This is a little known fact about what she did, but truly a patriotic, good American by any standards. For going to Vietnam, Col. Raye was considered a “hawk”. Hollywood blacklisted her for more then ten years. Most of the old time entertainers were made out of a lot sterner stuff than today’s crop of activists and whiners. The following is from an Army Aviator friend who takes another trip down memory lane: It was just before Thanksgiving ’67 and we were ferrying dead and wounded from a large GRF west of Pleiku, Vietnam. We had run out of body bags by noon, so the Hook (CH-47 CHINOOK) was pretty rough in the back. All of a sudden, we heard a ‘take-charge’ woman’s voice in the rear. There was the singer and actress, Martha Raye, with a SF (Special Forces) beret and jungle fatigues, with subdued markings, helping the wounded into the Chinook, and carrying the dead aboard. ‘Maggie’ had been visiting her SF ‘heroes’ out ‘west’. We took off, short of fuel, and headed to the USAF hospital pad at Pleiku. As we all started unloading our sad pax’s, a ‘Smart-Ass’ USAF Captain said to Martha…. Ms Ray, with all these dead and wounded to process, there would not be time for your show! To all of our surprise, she pulled on her right collar and said… Captain, see this eagle? I am a full ‘Bird’ Colonel in the US Army Reserve, and on this is a ‘Caduceus’ which means I am a Nurse, with a surgical specialty…. now, take me to your wounded. He said, yes ma’am…. Follow me. Several times at the Army Field Hospital in Pleiku, she would ‘cover’ a surgical shift, giving a nurse a well-deserved break. Martha is the only woman buried in the SF (Special Forces) cemetery at Ft. Bragg. Raye performed a similar service for G.I.s in two more wars, entertaining thousands and thousands of troops at U.S. military bases in Korea in the early 1950s and in Vietnam from 1965 to 1973. She is fondly remembered by generations of service members not just for her tireless efforts in staging shows for U.S. soldiers all over the world, but for uncomplainingly enduring the same conditions they did and for going far beyond the role of an entertainer by tending to troops in the field, including working with medivac units in Vietnam to pick up wounded Americans and assist in field hospitals. For example, an October 1966 Associated Press article reported the following account: Comedienne Martha Raye, a front-line trouper for 24 years, changed her routine last week. She donned fatigues and worked for two days in an Army field dispensary, cleansing wounds, changing bandages and comforting GIs wounded in a Mekong Delta battle. The twangy-voiced brunette, who has gone from outpost to tiny outpost throughout Viet Nam to entertain American servicemen, sang, danced and ribbed the men of two Army aviation helicopter companies stationed in the Mekong Delta town of Soc Trang. The next morning, the chopper pilots and their crews delivered Vietnamese soldiers to the paddy fields and marshlands of the delta to charge the entrenched Viet Cong. As the first helicopters settled into the landing zones, they were met by intense fire. The landing zones were in the stronghold of a Viet Cong battalion. Additional troops were brought in, and in the battle that followed four American helicopters were shot down and 20 were damaged. American casualties began arriving by 8 a.m., at the small Soc Trang dispensary. Miss Raye, a former nurse, arrived about the same time, dressed in Army fatigues and volunteering for duty. “She worked all day — until 9 that night — doing everything she could,” one corpsman said. One of the first things she did was donate a pint of blood to a badly wounded sergeant. Then it was hour after hour of scrubbing and preparing the wounded for surgery, helping the surgeons, changing bandages, and cheering up men awaiting evacuation to field hospitals in Vung Tau or Saigon. Miss Raye’s show did not go on that night. The next morning she was back at the hospital in her stained fatigues, helping one doctor and eight corpsmen care for the patients. Shortly before noon, when the work eased, Miss Raye flew 80 miles north to Vinh Long and performed that night for another unit of Army chopper crews who fly Vietnamese troops into battle. “She did a lot for the morale of the men who’d been shot up, and she did a lot for ours, too,” said a corpsman at the dispensary. As recognition of her efforts on behalf of U.S. service members, Martha Raye was given several honorary military designations, including the honorary ranks of lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army and colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps (leading to her being dubbed “Colonel Maggie” by troops in Vietnam). In 1993 she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton for her service to her country, with a citation reading as follows: A talented performer whose career spans the better part of a century, Martha Raye has delighted audiences and uplifted spirits around the globe. She brought her tremendous comedic and musical skills to her work in film, stage, and television, helping to shape American entertainment. the great courage, kindness, and patriotism she showed in her many tours during World War II, the Korean Conflict, and the Vietnam Conflict earned her the nickname ‘Colonel Maggie.’ The American people honor Martha Raye, a woman who has tirelessly used her gifts to benefit the lives of her fellow Americans. Her service to U.S. troops was also commemorated after her death in 1994 via her burial with military honors in the Post Cemetery at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, a singular honor for a civilian: Martha Raye’s exemplary service to the Army — including trips to Vietnam to entertain the Green Berets — earned her a funeral with military honors. Raye, who died in Los Angeles at age 78, requested several years [earlier] to be buried at Fort Bragg, home of the Green Berets. [S]he was to get her wish after a ceremony with a flag-draped casket and military pallbearers. Raye entertained troops in Vietnam for nine straight years, four months a year, spending much of the time with isolated Special Forces detachments in camps all over the country. Normally, only active duty and retired Army personnel are buried on post, but the Defense Department granted an exception for Raye, who was made an honorary lieutenant colonel in the Special Forces in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Martha Raye maintained in the late 1970s that she had been “blacklisted” from film and television work for her role in supporting American military efforts in Vietnam, but others have questioned whether that was really the case, pointing out that her film career had largely ended long before (she appeared in only two theatrical movies between the end of World War II and the 1970s: 1947’s Monsieur Verdoux and 1962’s Jumbo), that she made dozens of television appearances (both as herself and in character roles) during and immediately after the Vietnam War, and that many other entertainers performed for U.S. military personnel in Vietnam but experienced no decline in their employment prospects, and citing an overall paucity of film and television roles for actresses in their mid-50s and beyond as the likely cause for her difficulty in finding work in Hollywood in her later years.

314,1883,Bread a culprit in Americans eating too much salt.,"February 7, 2012","Nine out of 10 American adults consume too much salt and the leading culprit is not potato chips or popcorn but slices of bread and dinner rolls, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday.",David Beasley,"Bread basket is photographed in a shop in Warsaw February 7, 2012. REUTERS/Peter Andrews Forty-four percent of salt consumed can be linked to 10 types of foods, CDC said. Bread and rolls lead the list followed by cold cuts and cured meat, pizza, poultry, soups, sandwiches, cheese, pasta dishes, meat dishes and snacks such as pretzels and potato chips. Bread may not have much salt in a single serving, but when eaten several times a day can raise daily salt intake. A single slice of white bread could contain as many as 230 milligrams of salt, according to the CDC. High salt intake can raise blood pressure, which can lead to heart disease and stroke, the CDC said. The average American consumes 3,266 milligrams of salt daily, not counting salt added at the table, which is far above the recommended 2,300 milligrams, the CDC said. For six out of 10 Americans, including those who are over age 51 or have high blood pressure or diabetes, 1,500 milligrams is the recommended daily salt limit. Even foods that seem healthy such as cottage cheese may be high in salt, the agency reported. Even raw chicken and pork is often injected with salt. The CDC recommended eating more fruits and vegetables and carefully reading the labels on food products to find those with the lowest salt content. “Heart disease and stroke are leading causes of death in the United States and are largely dependent on the high rate of high blood pressure,” CDC Director Dr. Thomas R. Frieden told reporters in a telephone news conference Tuesday. One in three American adults has high blood pressure, he added. “One of the things that is driving blood pressure up is that most adults in this country eat or drink about twice the amount of sodium as is recommended,” Frieden said. “Most of that extra sodium comes from common grocery store and restaurant items and a very small proportion from the salt shaker at the table.”   Nearly two-thirds of the salt consumed by Americans is found in store products, 24.8 percent from restaurants and the remainder from other sources such as vending machines and the home salt shaker, the study found. Salt per calorie of food consumed was much higher at restaurants than from store-bought food, the CDC said. Frieden recommended that food producers and restaurants voluntarily reduce the amount of salt in their food. A 25-percent drop in the salt content of the top 10 sodium sources would save 28,000 lives a year, he added. It would also give consumers more choice, he said. “People can choose how much food to add at the table,” he said. “They can’t take it out once it’s there.”   The Grocery Manufacturer’s Association said that the food industry has been trying to reduce the salt content of thousands of products while keeping it tasty for consumers. “While progress is being made, reducing sodium in products without affecting the taste or consumer acceptance of products is no easy task,” the industry group said in a statement emailed to Reuters. The group said that challenges of reducing salt include finding substitutes for it that maintain the taste, and making sure that food safety standards are met because salt is a major preservative in many foods.",true,Health News
317,23877,"A major part"" of the climate change bill sponsored by Sens. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman ""was essentially written by BP.","June 14, 2010",McConnell says that Kerry-Lieberman climate bill 'essentially written by BP',Louis Jacobson,"The ongoing oil spill caused by a damaged BP well in the Gulf of Mexico is bringing attention to the relationship between the oil conglomerate and politicians. On June 9, 2010, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., used a floor speech to link BP and a climate-change bill sponsored by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.  ""The problem for Democrats is that debating the Democrat cap-and-trade bill might not fit neatly into the White House messaging plan, since it’s been widely reported that a major part of the Kerry-Lieberman bill was essentially written by BP. This is clearly an inconvenient fact: an administration that seems to spend most of its time coming up with new ways to show how angry it is with BP is pushing a proposal that BP helped write."" McConnell touched on a lot of points in this excerpt, but the one that most interested us was whether ""a major part of the Kerry-Lieberman bill was essentially written by BP."" When we asked McConnell's office for evidence to support this charge, a spokesman provided us with links to several news reports. These stories -- published over the past few months in the Washington Post, in the Capitol Hill newspaper The Hill, and in the energy-and-environment trade publication Greenwire -- offer ample evidence that BP was involved in the long-running negotiations over the bill, and that the company spoke favorably about the measure as it was being drafted. The articles indicated that BP, along with Shell, ConocoPhillips and the Edison Electric Institute, would ultimately endorse the measure. In fact, one article specifically noted that BP CEO Tony Hayward -- not yet the internationally known face of the disaster -- gave a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in March in which he ""indicated he was encouraged"" by the Kerry-Lieberman effort. Aides to Kerry and Lieberman do not dispute that BP was involved in the negotiations, along with many other parties. ""The senators met with more than 60 of their colleagues and all involved stakeholders, including environmentalists, religious leaders and the business community,"" said Whitney Smith, a spokeswoman for Kerry. ""The senators worked with a diverse set of colleagues and stakeholders to develop their discussion draft,"" added Lieberman spokesman Marshall Wittmann. ""They met with the CEOs of Shell, BP and Conoco because their industry will be regulated under the bill and it was important to ensure that the bill's approach to transportation emissions would reduce oil dependence. They also met with members of the business and environmental community in an effort to ensure that the bill met all of their goals: to grow the economy, create jobs and clean our air."" But it's one thing for a company's representatives to meet with Congressional aides, make the company's case and suggest that they may endorse a bill. It's another to actually write legislation. On this point, Kerry and Lieberman's offices are clear: ""Senators, not any industry, wrote this proposal, and any suggestion to the contrary is  and politically motivated,"" said Smith, the spokeswoman for Kerry. Let's delve into the evidence. On March 24, Houston Chronicle energy blogger Tom Fowler reprinted a ""discussion draft"" by BP that advocated several policy positions related to hydraulic fracking. That's a technique that allows energy companies to unlock natural gas by injecting chemicals into underground reservoirs. Critics have suggested that the procedure risks tainting adjoining water supplies, and they have urged lawmakers to establish tight controls on the process. As reprinted in Fowler's blog, the ""discussion draft"" argued that ""governments and industry have critical roles toward continuing to assure the public that hydraulic fracturing operations are effectively managed and regulated and that human health and the environment are protected."" Among other things, the draft sought to maintain ""the confidentiality of trade secret information."" However, this language was not included in the draft bill that Kerry and Lieberman released a month later. Quite the opposite: The bill draft said that ""a hydraulic fracturing service company shall disclose all chemical constituents used in a hydraulic fracturing operation to the public on the Internet in order to provide adequate information for the public and state and local authorities"" -- a much more stringent standard than that sought by BP. It's also worth noting that the BP ""discussion draft"" was not even intended to be actual language in the bill. Rather, it was intended as language for a ""Sense of the Senate"" resolution, which, unlike the law itself, is not binding. BP also sought a federal pre-emption for automobile tailpipe emissions, said Jeremy Symons, senior vice president at the National Wildlife Federation. That means that BP wanted the federal government to set a universal standard for emissions, rather than having states set their own levels, which could allow some states -- especially California -- to set stricter limits. Such a policy has been a longstanding item on the industry's agenda for climate change regulation. In this case, too, the Kerry-Lieberman draft bill specifically maintained the right of states to set emissions limits, leaving BP's idea on the cutting-room floor. And BP and other players in the industry proposed increasing gasoline taxes at the pump rather than curbing vehicular emissions through a direct cap, said John Coqueyt, a legislative specialist with the Sierra Club, an environmental group. After making progress initially, this idea was abandoned in the Kerry-Lieberman draft, Coqueyt said. ""On the one hand, BP did have substantial input into the Kerry bill,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign at the Center for Auto Safety. BP, other oil companies, the Edison Electric Institute and other industry groups ""submitted much language and many ideas. Some are probably recognizable in the current bill. ... But I don't think it is accurate to say that BP essentially wrote a major part of the bill."" We agree. There's no question that BP, by taking a cooperative stance with Kerry and Lieberman rather than an adversarial one, had the opportunity to float its ideas during the legislative drafting process. And by dangling the possibility that the company might back the bill -- which would provide the senators with politically valuable support on a complicated and contentious bill -- BP and other energy companies wielded some leverage in the drafting process. In fact, many on the left -- not just conservatives like McConnell-- are disappointed that Kerry and other Democratic supporters of climate change legislation worked with oil companies, including BP, while crafting the bill. But saying that the senators listened to BP's case is not the same as saying that ""a major part"" of the bill ""was essentially written by BP."" In fact, looking at three BP-pushed initiatives that have come to light shows that none were included in the current draft of the bill, which suggests that the senators and their aides were hardly captive to BP. It may be revealing that one day after the statement we're checking, McConnell had toned down his description of BP's role. In a floor speech on June 10, 2010, McConnell said, ""Some favor the Kerry-Lieberman cap-and-trade bill, a significant portion of which, by the way, has been pushed by the oil company BP."" If he'd simply said ""pushed"" the day before, he would have been pretty close to being accurate. But McConnell went much further when he said that BP had ""essentially written"" a ""major part"" of the bill. We rule that claim by McConnell .",false,"Environment, National, Climate Change, Corporations, Energy, Oil Spill, Mitch McConnell, "
319,22127,"Tom Petri Says President Barack Obama’s debt commission recommended converting Medicare ""to a system where Medicare participants are given a voucher to purchase insurance in the private market.","May 10, 2011",Wisconsin GOP Rep. Petri says Obama commission recommended vouchers for Medicare,Tom Kertscher,"When House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan submitted his 2012 federal budget plan in April 2011, he touted how much more it cut spending, debt and deficits than President Barack Obama’s plan. Some of the loudest objections to the Wisconsin Republican’s proposal, however, decried its transformation of Medicare. MoveOn.org, a left-leaning political advocacy group, went so far as to say Ryan would abolish the 46-year-old program in 10 years. We ruled that claim , partly because current Medicare recipients would continue to receive traditional Medicare even after 10 years. But, as we noted, Ryan’s plan would change Medicare dramatically. Starting in 2022, Medicare would no longer directly help pay for doctor visits, hospital care, other services and prescription drugs. Rather, future Medicare participants would choose a private insurance plan and Medicare -- through what are called premium-support payments or vouchers -- would help pay for the insurance. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group that studies health care policy, noted that in the days after Ryan’s budget plan was released, three national polls found Americans divided on such a change. Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, R-Wisconsin, was conducting his annual survey of constituents. In his April 2011 newsletter, the 32-year Fond du Lac congressman posed this question to residents in the 6th District, which is north and west of Milwaukee:  ""One of the recommendations put forth by the president’s debt commission was to convert the Medicare system from a government-run insurance program to a system where Medicare participants are given a voucher to purchase insurance in the private market. Would you support such a change?"" That left us with this question: Did a commission created by a Democratic president recommend the same sweeping change to Medicare that was part of the House GOP budget? The debt commission mentioned in Petri’s question -- the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform-- was formed by an Obama executive order in February 2010. The 18-member panel included Ryan, who was appointed by Republican leaders of the House of Representatives. The commission was charged with making recommendations to balance the federal budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. The recommendations came in a report issued in December 2010. This is what Petri’s survey question cited in saying the commission recommended a voucher program for Medicare. The word voucher appears only once in the commission’s 66-page report, as part of Recommendation ""3.3.13."" The recommendation addressed Federal Employees Health Benefits, the health insurance program for federal employees and retirees. The commission said the insurance should be made into a premium-support or voucher program. Federal retirees could use their voucher to pay part of their Medicare premium. But that is for a limited group, federal employees and retirees. That is not transforming all of Medicare into a voucher program. Had that recommendation been made, it undoubtedly would have stirred the same criticism that the Republican plan has. The commission’s report noted that two commission members -- Ryan and Alice Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton -- had proposed converting Medicare into a voucher system. The commission’s view was that such a system ""holds significant promise of controlling costs, but also carries serious potential risks."" The commission suggested that, if its recommendation were put in place to make health insurance for federal employees and retirees a premium-support or voucher program, ""that experience would be useful in considering a premium-support program for Medicare."" So, the president’s commission recommended trying a voucher program with federal employees and retirees and then, based on the results, deciding whether to try it with Medicare. After we contacted Petri’s office on May 6, 2011, spokesman Niel Wright said the wording in the constituent survey question about Medicare was incorrect. He said the question should have stated that the president’s commission ""discussed,"" rather than recommended, making Medicare a voucher program. Also after our call, this note was added to the electronic version of the survey question on Petri’s website:  ""CORRECTION: The question above is somewhat misleading. Instead of saying that the recommendation was ‘put forth’ by the president's debt commission, the question should read that this recommendation was ‘discussed’ by the president's debt commission."" Wright told us that when Petri’s office distributes results of the survey, a note will be included ""indicating that a problem with this question was brought to our attention,"" as would ""additional information clarifying how the question should have been phrased."" Wright also said the survey was reviewed by the Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards, also known as the Franking Commission, and that ""neither the Republican nor the Democratic staffers at the commission noticed anything objectionable"" or partisan. Turning to the Truth-O-Meter, in surveying constituents, GOP Congressman Tom Petri said a commission created by the Democratic president had recommended making Medicare a voucher program. The commission did not make that recommendation and Petri admitted the wording in his survey was wrong. We rate his statement .",false,"Deficit, Federal Budget, Medicare, Wisconsin, Tom Petri, "
320,30696,Gabapentin is now considered the most dangerous drug in America and will surpass opioids as the largest prescription drug killer.,"January 17, 2018","While the increasing prevalence of gabapentin abuse is an important finding and a vital step in understanding the complexities of the opioid epidemic, it is not a finding that should cause legitimate users alarm. To suggest that a drug which millions of people depend on is deadly and should be avoided at all costs, as the viral Facebook post suggested, is wholly irresponsible. Its potential for abuse was underestimated, but nobody is arguing that it is now more likely to cause death through an overdose on its own. As such, we rank this claim as false.",Alex Kasprak,"On 28 June 2017, Kaiser Health News reported on an apparent increase in abuse of gabapentin (brand name Neurontin) in Ohio and across the nation in a story that saw wide syndication in USA Today, STAT News, and many other outlets: Last December, Ohio’s Board of Pharmacy began reporting sales of gabapentin prescriptions in its regular monitoring of controlled substances. The drug, which is not an opioid nor designated a controlled substance by federal authorities, is used to treat nerve pain. But the board found that it was the most prescribed medication on its list that month, surpassing oxycodone by more than 9 million doses. In February, the Ohio Substance Abuse Monitoring Network issued an alert regarding increasing misuse across the state. The claims that gabapentin is “the most dangerous drug in America” gained widespread exposure thanks to a viral 1 January 2018 Facebook post that alleged, without sources, that gabapentin is the “newest” killer prescription. Claims that it is “killing thousands” appear to be based off this earlier reporting. While abuse of the drug “on the street” may be a newer phenomenon, gabapentin has been around since 1993 as a treatment of epilepsy in the United States. In the European Union, the drug is approved to treat neuropathic pain as well. Controversially, the drug has been — and continues to be — used to treat a wide variety of unapproved conditions off-label. The drug is not a narcotic like an opioid, and it has only an indirect effect on the central nervous system, making a direct overdose from the drug alone unlikely. A 62-year-old woman’s suicide, reported in a 2011 case study, claimed to be the first published report of a gabapentin overdose in combination with no other drugs — an outcome that confounded researchers. (There has since been at least one other gabapentin overdose reported in the absence of other drugs). The pharmacological and medical community have long considered the drug safe with few adverse effects. This lack of concern about its adverse effects, more recent research alleges, may have masked the legitimate risk for the drug’s potential for abuse. While a high from abusing the drug alone is reported to be mild, numerous case studies have indicated that opioid addicts find that gabapentin is able to increase the euphoric effects of an opioid high. Larger scale studies of opioid addicted individuals have confirmed this. Increasing awareness of the link between gabapentin and opiod addicts lead the Ohio Substance Abuse Monitoring Network to issue a February 2017 warning, which partially inspired the original June 2017 reporting by Kaiser Health News, and included this first-person account of its use: It’s not a narcotic, but what it does, is, it intensifies your methadone [an opioid]… so if you take your methadone and you go buy 10 [gabapentin pills] and you take all 10, it’s sort of like you tripled your dose. Further confusion over the lethality of gabapentin, based on the comments in the aforementioned viral post, appear to stem from an in-depth analysis of drug overdose deaths in Kentucky in 2016 performed by FiveThirtyEight and published on 17 January 2018. That story (“There Is More Than One Opioid Crisis”) indicated that 32.6 percent of all people who overdosed in Kentucky in 2016 had the presence of gabapentin in their system under autopsy, and that it was the most common drug found in some specific demographics: According to the findings, gabapentin […] was the drug most frequently detected in women who had died from drug overdoses and among victims over the age of 44. Crucially, these data do not indicate that gabapentin caused these deaths, just that its presence was found during autopsy toxicology reports. These data, as well, do not indicate that gabapentin was the only drug found in the system of drug overdose victims. To further illustrate that point, THC, the active component of marijuana which is incapable of causing an overdose on its own, was detected in a quarter of cases, according to the same dataset; it is impossible to credibly argue that marijuana caused a quarter of overdose deaths in Kentucky in 2016. The fact that gabapentin was frequently found in combination with opiates in that report, however, lends further credence to the idea that the drug is being used as a way to enhance the effects of other more deadly drugs.",false,"Medical, drug abuse, drug overdose, gabapentin"
321,1872,Disney closes controversial fat-fighting exhibit.,"March 3, 2012",Obesity experts on Friday applauded Walt Disney World for shuttering a new attraction that drew fierce criticism for its potential to shame overweight children and misrepresent the causes of the global obesity crisis.,Barbara Liston,"“I think they (Disney) likely subscribed to that common misconception that this is something we should just be able to push away from the table and cure,” said Ottawa bariatric surgeon Yoni Freedhoff, whose blog post sparked a public outcry over the attraction at Walt Disney Co’s world-famous Florida theme park. “The truth is, if it was that simple to manage weight, I’m pretty confident we wouldn’t have a problem,” said Freedhoff. Disney last month unofficially opened the interactive exhibit called “Habit Heroes” at Epcot, one of the sites at the park, and introduced a companion online game. In both, svelte heroes, “Callie Stenics” and “Will Power,” combat fat and misshapen villains with names like “Lead Bottom” and “The Snacker.”   “Here, they (children) are in Disney, the happiest place on earth, and basically Disney is being the schoolyard bully that’s been making fun of them for years at home,” Freedhoff said. Freedhoff blogged on February 23 about what he called the “horrifying” exhibit. Disney closed the exhibit two days later following complaints and petition drives by other advocates for the overweight and people with eating disorders. Disney spokeswoman Kathleen Prihoda told Reuters no date has been set for Habit Heroes to reopen. “We’ve closed it for the time being to further improve and refine the experience,” Prihoda said. “We’ve received feedback from a variety of sources and we’re taking it all into consideration at this time.”   The exhibit was sponsored by two independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations. Spokesman John Herbkersman of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida told Reuters that initial reaction from Disney guests was positive. He said the Disney Imagineers created the exhibit, and that he did not know how much input his organization had in crafting its message. The World Health Organization, which calls childhood obesity one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century, cites many causes, including a global shift in food processing, food marketing, the fat and sugar content of food, increased urbanization and changes in the way people get around. “Kids have not suddenly suffered an epidemic loss of will power. I think the world in which children are growing up has changed very dramatically,” Freedhoff said. In January researchers with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2009 and 2010, about one in three American adults and one in six children and teenagers were obese. Laura Discipio said her organization, the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, was one of several that urged its supporters to put public pressure on Disney to rethink Habit Heroes. “They (Disney officials) said the goal is really to teach people how to be healthy. I said I get that, but you can’t be villainizing children of size,” Discipio said. A petition started by the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance logged more than 300 signatures before the exhibit was closed, according to spokeswoman Peggy Howell. “The attraction and game feature negative stereotypical characters, traditionally used to torment overweight kids, will potentially reinforce and strengthen a cycle of bullying, depression, disease, eating disorders and even suicidal thoughts,” the petition stated. Howell said members of her board of directors have received personal letters and phone calls from Disney asking for their input. “The problem is quite complicated despite the fact that there is this truism that involves eating fewer calories and/or burning more of them,” Freedhoff said. “That truism is about as useful as buy low/sell high would be to making you a millionaire in the stock market. It’s true. It’s just not helpful.”",true,Health News
322,11446,Abaloparatide may help prevent fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis,"April 11, 2016","This release from The Endocrine Society describes the results of one of a series of randomized, double-blind comparative clinical trials of abaloparatide-SC, an investigational drug designed to increase bone mineral density and prevent bone fractures in postmenopausal women who have osteoporosis and who already had suffered one fracture. The study was presented as a poster presentation at the Society’s recent conference. The release helpfully — and carefully — notes early that the research is “industry sponsored.” The release did a good job discussing the study design and results but didn’t address potential cost and harms. Some health organizations estimate more than 200 million women (and men) worldwide have osteoporosis and that in the United States, 43 million adults are at risk for osteoporosis and that the disease is responsible for about 2 million broken bones each year. Various prescription treatments are on the market designed to increase bone mineral density and either prevent fractures in the first place or reduce the risk of a subsequent one. Exercise, diet and lifestyle also are involved in risk factor prevention and modification, and all of the prescription drugs carry risks for some women of serious side effects, including higher than usual risks for a rare form of bone cancer, kidney stones, weakness, respiratory infections, and dizziness. The costs of some treatments also are high. Thus, any news of additional drug treatments will be of significant interest to millions of women and men.","Joann Rodgers, MS,Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Kathlyn Stone","The release doesn’t include any discussion of the financial burden of the disease or estimated costs of treating it. This is a big market for drug makers and there are plenty of data available. Forteo, a similar drug to abaloparatide-SC, a human parathyroid hormone, is already on the market. It is reasonable to assume that the cost structure will be similar. GoodRx.com notes that a 28 day supply costs about $2,400. The release would have been much more helpful to the reader if it had included some absolute numbers along with the relative risk reductions. The release notes that of 2,463 osteoporosis patients, ages 49 to 86, the drug increased bone mineral density in the lumbar spine by 9.2%, in the hip 3.4% and in the femoral neck by 2.9% compared to placebo. The release also describes the reduction in vertebral fractures by 86%, and other risk reductions, also in terms of percentages. But what were the actual rates of fractures in each group? That would give readers the best sense of the size of the benefit. A serious omission, the release is essentially silent about potential harms, which, according to other sources, may include “back pain, arthralgia, upper-respiratory-tract infection, hypercalciuria, and dizziness.” A mid-term post-marketing surveillance study of Forteo (teriparatide), a related drug on the market, observed an association but not causation with osteosarcoma (a rare malignant bone cancer) in people taking the drug. Osteosarcoma had been observed in animal trials of the drug that were dependent on dose and treatment duration. The release provides a good overview of the randomized, double-blind trial which lasted 18 months and provides demographics of those enrolled in the study. The release also lets readers know that there is at least one other drug similar to the one being studied that is already FDA approved. It does a quick but effective job of distinguishing what might be better about the new drug. (Increased density in the hip region that is greater than the existing compound.) It would have been helpful to note that the trial was conducted in the US, Brazil and Denmark which carry different levels of risk for fracture in post menopausal women, as pointed out in an International Osteoporosis Foundation report. Statements about the potential value of the drug are reasonable and cautious and there’s no disease mongering here. The release prominently and early notes that the research is “industry sponsored,” and names the company (Radius Health, Inc.). It also notes that the investigator quoted in the release is a consultant to the company. Kudos! Because the study was comparative, the release gives some detail about its head-to-head comparison with a current drug on the market. There is another class of drug treatments, namely bisphosphonates, that could have been mentioned. The release notes that the drug is investigational which signifies it is not yet FDA approved and that the study was a phase 3 study. The release doesn’t make a explicit claim to novelty but it does note the greater hip bone density benefit and reduced fractures with the new drug compared to the existing drug and placebo. We’ll give them the benefit of the doubt as this is a strong indication of new findings. There’s no unjustifiable language in use here.",true,"Association/Society news release,Women's health"
323,35678,"People vaccinated for seasonal influenza face higher chances of catching SARS-COV-2, which causes COVID-19, or testing positive for the virus when they do not actually have it. ","May 14, 2020","A panel for the North Carolina Medical Board in 2008 ruled Buttar should stop treating children or patients with cancer because “his alternative medicine practice is below accepted medical standards in North Carolina.” But the doctor challenged that recommendation, and in 2010 the board and Buttar made a compromise: He could continue offering his treatments so long as his participants signed consent forms “acknowledging this practice is outside the mainstream,” according to the newspaper.",Jessica Lee,"Since the early weeks of the U.S. COVID-19 coronavirus disease outbreak in March 2020, social media users began spreading claims that people who had gotten vaccinated to increase their immunity against seasonal influenza were at a higher risk of catching or testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The assertions took a variety of forms and resurged with new viral postings over weeks. In March and early April, many cited misinterpretations of a 2020 study by an epidemiologist with the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) that examined how the 2017-2018 flu season affected personnel. “You can get coronavirus from the flu shot,” one person wrote to Snopes, referencing the DOD study (which we unpack below). Then, in late April and May, the claims shifted to focus on remarks by anti-vaccine advocate and conspiracy theorist, Dr. Rashid Buttar, who said in a video interview posted on Facebook on April 19: All the way back to 1984 all the way up to now, 2018, there are multiple studies that show that if you’ve had the flu shot… false positives on COVID-19 testing. After that posting, numerous Facebook accounts circulated the below-displayed meme:  For the purpose of this investigation, we will first dissect what appear to be the main sources of the claim regarding flu shots — the DOD study that examined the health of military personnel (which is available via a five-page PDF) and Buttar, and then provide scientific and medical research that prove their invalidity. Greg Wolff, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch, conducted the study, examining whether the flu vaccine between October 2017 and September 2018 increased his colleagues’ risk for non-flu respiratory viruses, such as coronavirus, adenovirus or human bocavirus, via a phenomenon known as virus interference. Of the roughly 9,500 DOD employees he considered for the research — most of whom were male active duty service members between 18 and 35 years old — more than two-thirds had gotten flu shots that season; however, that group did not show significant odds of catching other respiratory illnesses compared to those who were not vaccinated, according to Wolff’s findings. The study states: The overall results of the study showed little to no evidence supporting the association of virus interference and influenza vaccination. Individual respiratory virus results were mixed, and some rebutted virus interference. Additionally those receiving the influenza vaccine were more likely to have no pathogen detected and reduced risk of influenza when compared to unvaccinated individuals. In other words, the flu shot did not change the likelihood of test subjects overall catching other respiratory illnesses; however, each non-flu respiratory virus, such as coronavirus, showed varied results for how they impacted vaccinated DOD employees. At the same time, the vaccine protected personnel against influenza, the study found. The idea of non-flu respiratory viruses showing individually different results on the test population is where anti-vaxxers focused their messaging. On April 16, 2020, more than three months after Wolff published the study, an anti-vaccine nonprofit called the Children’s Health Defense highlighted the DOD research on its website, with the headline, “Pentagon Study: Flu Shot Raises Risk of Coronavirus by 36% (and Other Supporting Studies).” Authored by the organization’s founder, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a high-profile leader of the U.S. modern anti-vaxx movement, the web page focused on one aspect of Wolff’s multi-pronged study of DOD personnel: 507 test subjects who did not have the flu and were vaccinated to increase their immunity against it tested positive for “coronavirus,” while only 170 test subjects who did not have an influenza vaccine tested positive for “coronavirus.” The study included the following table:  Wolff summarized that finding like this: Examining non-influenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (which causes upper and lower respiratory disease with cold-like symptoms) in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals. But nowhere did the epidemiologist describe the type of coronavirus(es) for which his subjects tested positive, and the Children’s Health Defense and other anti-vaxxers failed to make that distinction in their postings. In science, the word “coronavirus” refers to a family of hundreds of viruses, not just one type of sickness. (Politicians and journalists frequently — and misleadingly — used the term in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the novel coronavirus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.) Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seven types of coronaviruses cause illness in humans, some of which are fairly common and cause seasonal cold-like symptoms while others cause more severe and sometimes fatal infections, including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The type of coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease is called SARS-CoV-2, and it was yet to be discovered at the time of Wolff’s study in 2017 and 2018. That means no one in the experiment was confirmed to have the virus that causes COVID-19, and Wolff did not once refer to the novel coronavirus in his research. Additionally, considering the size and makeup of Wolff’s testing sample — as well as the overall findings of the study (mentioned above) and the fact that coronaviruses and influenza viruses vary by season and impact age groups differently — any assertion that the research definitely proves a connection between influenza vaccines and coronaviruses, including COVID-19, is misleading. According to the CDC, everyone 6 months and older should get an influenza vaccine each year to increase their chances of fighting the flu — even in the era of COVID-19 — though the effectiveness of the shot may vary person-to-person, year-to-year. The CDC states: Any flu infection can carry a risk of serious complications, hospitalization or death, even among otherwise healthy children and adults. Therefore, getting vaccinated is a safer choice than risking illness to obtain immune protection. In terms of whether the shot makes people more susceptible to other respiratory viruses, which in 2020 could include COVID-19, no strong scientific or medical evidence shows that flu shots increase people’s risk of catching other viruses as of this writing. One 2012 study in the peer-reviewed medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, which considered a test sample of 115 children and teens, suggested the flu vaccine might increase people’s odds of catching non-flu viruses. But a study one year later in the same peer-reviewed journal came to the opposite conclusion. The CDC said: Many experts looked into this issue further and conducted additional studies to see if the findings (in the 2012 study of children and teens) could be replicated. No other studies have found this effect. … It’s not clear why this finding was detected in the one study, but the preponderance of evidence suggests that this is not a common or regular occurrence and that influenza vaccination does not, in fact, make people more susceptible to other respiratory infections. Buttar, a licensed doctor of osteopathic medicine in North Carolina, is another leading source of the viral COVID-19-era claim that flu shots worsen your chances of catching the novel virus. In at least one spring 2020 video appearance (mentioned above), he claimed: “Studies clearly show that if you’ve had a flu shot, you’re going to test positive for COVID-19,” suggesting that the influenza vaccination contains antibodies that would make a person show a false positive on a COVID-19 test. Buttar first gained public recognition via his hometown newspaper, the Charlotte Observer, in the late 1990s, advertising “advanced concepts in alternative and preventative medicine.” A few years later, he and another doctor gained news coverage for enrolling patients with heart disease in a controversial study that tested chelation therapy, a treatment to remove metals from patients’ bloodstream and commonly used to treat people with heavy metal poisoning. But in the late 2000s, Buttar’s unconventional practices drew criticism. In 2007, the North Carolina Medical Board accused Buttar of “unprofessional conduct for departing from prevailing medical practice by treating patients with experimental, ineffective therapies and charging ‘exorbitant’ fees’ for unproven therapies that didn’t work,” the Charlotte Observer reported. A local TV station reported: Buttar has spent years selling skin drops at $150 a bottle as a treatment for diseases ranging from autism to cancer.",false,"Politics, COVID-19"
324,16895,Gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years.,"June 16, 2014","The social media meme said that ""gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years."" The gun homicide rate is actually down by 49 percent over the past 17 years, but this seemingly minor mistake betrays a significant misunderstanding of how rates have fluctuated over the past two decades. During the past dozen years, gun homicide rates have been largely static; their big decline mostly came in the years before the meme even started counting. The meme is not just incorrect; it’s a distraction from what actually happened.",Louis Jacobson,"In the social media wars over gun control, a new social-media meme makes the case that gun violence is wildly exaggerated by the media. ""Gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years. Only 12 percent of Americans know that. Tell us again how unbiased our media is,"" the Facebook post said. A reader sent us the posting and asked us to fact-check it. We’ll focus our attention on the claim about gun homicides, but we’ll also touch on the media question later on. Trends in gun homicide We began by looking at year-by-year statistics on gun homicides compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since the meme’s language was clear about focusing on ""homicides,"" we didn’t include statistics for suicides, gun shootings with undetermined causes, or ""legal interventions,"" such as justified shootings by police. The most recent data is for 2010, so we went as far back as 1998 to define the 12-year period. This table summarizes what we found:  Year Gun homicides Gun homicides per 100,000 people 1998 11,798 4.28 1999 10,828 3.88 2000 10,801 3.84 2001 11,348 3.98 2002 11,829 4.11 2003 11,920 4.11 2004 11,624 3.97 2005 12,352 4.18 2006 12,791 4.29 2007 12,632 4.19 2008 12,179 4.01 2009 11,493 3.75 2010 11,078 3.59  This disproves the clear wording of the meme. Over the past 12 years, the number of gun homicides is down 6 percent, and the rate of gun homicides is down 16 percent. Both are well below the 49 percent claimed in the post. However, we also found that the statistic did come from somewhere. The 49 percent decline emerged from 2013 report by the Pew Research Center. It found that gun homicides (or more specifically, the rate of gun homicides per 100,000 residents) had declined by 49 percent between their peak in 1993 and 2010, a period of 17 years. We double-checked Pew’s calculations of the CDC figures and found that they were correct. Between 1993 and 2010, the gun homicide rate fell from 7.02 per 100,000 to 3.59 per 100,000, or a decline of precisely 49 percent. Here’s the rundown of those earlier years:  Year Gun homicides Gun homicides per 100,000 people 1992 17,488 6.82 1993 18,253 7.02 1994 17,527 6.66 1995 15,551 5.84 1996 14,037 5.21 1997 13,252 4.86  It’s possible to chalk this mistake up to a simple typo -- after all, if the claim had said 17 years rather than 12, it would have been correct. However, the time frame raises important issues. For one thing, the CDC data show that the big decline in gun homicides came between 1993 and 2000, which happens to coincide with the years Bill Clinton was president. While Clinton and his policies are hardly the only reason for this decline, his signing of tighter gun-control legislation makes him unpopular among the kinds of gun supporters who might have created this meme. By contrast, by framing the decline as happening over the past 12 years, the meme implies that George W. Bush -- a president much more friendly to gun-rights supporters -- can take some credit for the decline. More importantly, by making this mistake, the meme misunderstands the overall trend lines of gun homicides. Gun homicides didn’t decline 49 percent over the last 12 years -- rather, they declined precipitously over six years in the 1990s, then have remained basically stagnant for the past decade or so. Why is this important? Because the decline, to a large degree, has to do with a specific reason -- the end of the crack epidemic. The decline in gun homicides in the 1990s ""was largely a reversal of an upward trend that occurred in the mid-to-late 1980s,"" said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. ""There would not have been much of a downturn were it not for the surge. This up-and-down change was primarily in cities and among offenders under age 25, and indeed have much to do with crack markets and gang activity."" In fact, the Pew study made the same point, noting that ""by the early 1990s, crack markets withered in part because of lessened demand, and the vibrant national economy made it easier for even low-skilled young people to find jobs rather than get involved in crime. At the same time, a rising number of people ages 30 and older were incarcerated, due in part to stricter laws, which helped restrain violence among this age group."" Fox said another reason for the decline in gun homicides overall was a specific decline in cases that involved intimate partners. After 1993, when the pro-gun-control Brady Law was passed, ""there was a decline in gun homicides by women against their partners, but no decline in non-gun killings,"" he said. Media bias? The meme also takes a shot at the media for burying this large decline. But that’s not deserved. Just the first two pages of Google search results show articles about the Pew study appearing in the following outlets: • Associated Press • Washington Post • CNN • NPR • NBC News • Yahoo News Oh, and PolitiFact. As for the claim that ""only 12 percent of Americans know that,"" the meme got the percentage right, though of course it got the substance of what that 12 percent knew wrong. ""Despite national attention to the issue of firearm violence, most Americans are unaware that gun crime is lower today than it was two decades ago,"" the report said. ""According to a new Pew Research Center survey, today 56 percent of Americans believe gun crime is higher than 20 years ago and only 12 percent think it is lower."" Our ruling The social media meme said that ""gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years."" The gun homicide rate is actually down by 49 percent over the past 17 years, but this seemingly minor mistake betrays a significant misunderstanding of how rates have fluctuated over the past two decades. During the past dozen years, gun homicide rates have been largely static; their big decline mostly came in the years before the meme even started counting.

330,8415,Ireland has mostly contained coronavirus outbreak: health chief.,"April 16, 2020","Ireland has contained and effectively suppressed the first wave of the coronavirus outbreak in the population at large but not in nursing homes where its spread remains a concern, the country’s chief medical officer said on Thursday.",Padraic Halpin,"The assessment raised hopes that stay-at-home restrictions can be gradually eased from May 5. Acting Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said earlier on Thursday that he hoped to set out a roadmap on how they could be eased before the May 5 expiry. Ireland reported 724 new cases to bring its total to 13,271 with 486 deaths, but officials said the growth rate in new cases has been close to zero since April 3 and the closely watched reproductive rate, or the number of people who become infected from each positive case, fell to between 0.7 and 1. “The data clearly shows that there are two very different experiences of COVID-19,” Tony Holohan said in a statement, referring the continued spread of the disease in care settings versus the containment elsewhere. “In order to protect the vulnerable the first task was to suppress the virus in the population at large. We are increasingly confident that we are achieving this. All of our efforts now need to be on extinguishing COVID-19 in our community residential settings, including nursing homes.”   Nursing homes account for 253 of the 486 coronavirus-related deaths, with 49 more fatalities associated with other care homes or community facilities. There are clusters of two or more cases in 163 of the country’s 550 retirement homes. Eight people or almost a third of residents at one old age psychiatric home who had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, died over the Easter holiday weekend, Ireland’s Health Service Executive said on Wednesday. Varadkar told parliament that new measures to help protect nursing home residents were not being implemented fast enough, as his acting government faced criticism by opposition politicians for the speed of its response. The government promised nursing homes additional funds, more staff, priority testing and the redeployment of senior medics to improve infectious disease control on April 4 after the number of clusters began to rise rapidly. Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin, who is in negotiations to form a new government with Varadkar, said nursing homes had been “left behind significantly.”  Health officials across the world have warned that the elderly are especially vulnerable in the pandemic. The median age of deaths in Ireland is 82, compared to a median age of 48 of all those infected, according to health department data. Varadkar also said any roll back of restrictions would be done over a number of months, a message emphasised later by his health officials. “Whatever happens after May 5 has to be approached exceptionally carefully. We can manage a modest rise in cases, if it’s done slightly wrong, but we can’t manage a huge rise in cases,” Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group chair, Professor Philip Nolan, told a news conference.",true,Health News

Neither did we. But that's what we were told in a July 14 feature titled ""11 Awesome Facts You Never Knew About Rhode Island,"" listed on the popular news and entertainment website BuzzFeed. Here at PolitiFact, we had two questions. First: Is that really true? Second: Who thinks the inability to buy a toothbrush and toothpaste together on a Sunday is awesome? For the uninitiated, BuzzFeed,  which regards itself as a legitimate news website, is always trying to take a hot topic and make it hotter. BuzzFeed loves lists.

(For example, we couldn't find any reference in state law to BuzzFeed's contention that ""It is illegal to throw pickle juice on a trolley in Rhode Island."") We decided to focus on the toothbrush claim because we don't want Providence residents to be at a disadvantage when it comes to dental hygiene. We emailed BuzzFeed and asked for its source. We also checked Rhode Island law to see if there was a toothpaste-toothbrush statute that applied to Providence (or any community). We came up with nothing. We also checked the online version of Providence's city ordinances. We found nada. Then we called Providence City Hall and spoke to Deputy City Clerk Lori Hagen, who indulged us and did her own check. She found zip. The ordinances don't contain any derivative of the word ""tooth."" If it existed, ""it would be in the code of ordinances,"" Hagen said, adding that she's never heard of any such restriction. She's worked for the city for 24 years. We thought it might be an old ordinance, repealed long ago. City Archivist Paul Campbell came up with bupkis. When we heard back from BuzzFeed, spokeswoman Augusta Mellon said in an email that a Google search for ""sell toothbrush toothpaste sunday rhode island"" produced over 8 million hits. (We checked that claim as well. Actual number of hits: about 650, and some of those didn't even refer to the ""law."") Mellon said, ""There's multiple accredited sources that have written about it, including the Brown Daily Herald and the Telegraph"" in Australia. The unnamed blogger for the Herald, Brown University's student newspaper, reported buying both items at a local CVS, insisted that the prohibition was real, and treated the purchase like an act of civil disobedience. The blogger's source turned out to be a list at DumbLaws.com, which cites no actual law, past or present. At least the Telegraph story begins: ""Here is a list of the world's most ridiculous laws or urban myths - we’re not quite sure."" BuzzFeed's Mellon ended her email by saying, ""It seems like it's a commonly referenced piece of information."" She should have added, ""Which nobody ever checks."" So oral hygiene fans can breathe a minty-fresh sigh of relief. A toothbrush and toothpaste can legally be purchased together any Sunday in Providence.

Scott Walker was asked by a Wisconsin reporter for his reaction to the gunslaying of 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. the previous day. That was before authorities had determined that the husband-and-wife shooters had discussed jihad and martyrdom. Walker responded by talking about mental illness. ""We don’t know enough about this instance. But for others like that, what we’ve found is one of the common denominators in many of these cases are people who’ve slipped through the cracks when it comes to chronic mental illness,"" the governor said. ""That’s why I’m proud that here in Wisconsin, we’ve put in previous budgets more money into mental health services than any governor has in the last 25 years."" Two longtime mental health advocates told us that Walker’s funding boost was exceptional. ""We were hard pressed to think of anything quite as significant,"" said Shel Gross, senior policy associate at Mental Health America of Wisconsin. So let’s see whether Walker put into the state budget more money for mental health than any governor in the last quarter-century. Walker’s evidence Walker announced in February 2013, in the wake of mass shootings in Newtown, Conn., and at a Sikh temple and a spa in suburban Milwaukee, that he would raise spending on mental health services by $29 million in his 2013-’15 state budget. The six initiatives included $12.6 million to open two units at the Mendota Mental Health Institute, a state-run psychiatric hospital in Madison for patients who have been committed, and $10.2 million for expanding community-based care programs for people with severe mental illness. When Walker made his formal budget presentation later that month, he said only half of all Wisconsin adults with ""serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication"". We noted that the Wisconsin chapter of National Alliance on Mental Illness had praised the spending boost, but criticized Walker for rejecting a proposal under President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid, saying his decision ""reflects a shallow understanding"" of ""crucial means to affordable mental health care for Wisconsin residents."" Mental health benefits in private-sector insurance plans are generally less comprehensive than those provided by Medicaid. But that is separate from the amount of state funds Walker put into the state budget. To back the governor’s claim, a spokeswoman provided us a February 2013 email from Walker’s Department of Administration that said there had not been a mental health funding boost in ""general purpose revenue"" since the creation of what was known as the ""community aids"" program in the mid-1970s. Walker’s office also had his Department of Health Services provide us more detail in restating that his investment was the largest since the ‘70s. Separately, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau confirmed to us that the $29  million increase in state funding budgeted for mental health services in the 2013-15 state budget was the largest increase in at least 25 years, and that no other increases during that time were nearly as much. A final note: Charlie Morgan, a program supervisor for the fiscal bureau, told us that the total amount the state budgets for mental health services ""is not easily answered."" That’s because funding for those services is provided through many programs, including: inpatient services provided by the state's mental health hospitals, community-based mental health services that are budgeted as distinct programs; and funding the state provides to counties, including for programs that provide mental health as well as substance abuse services. But it’s clear the additional $29 million added by Walker is the largest such increase in at least 25 years, he said. Our rating Walker said: ""Here in Wisconsin, we've put in previous budgets more money into mental health services than any governor has in the last 25 years."" It’s worth noting that Walker refused a federal expansion of Medicaid that would have provided more mental health services to Wisconsinites.

336,41830,"Sen.

Elizabeth Warren released the results of a genetic test showing she has a small but detectable amount of Native American DNA. The report concluded there is “strong evidence” she had a Native American ancestor approximately six to 10 generations ago. But many have misconstrued the results — including President Donald Trump, who wrongly claimed Warren “doesn’t have any Indian blood.”Warren’s release, which was widely interpreted as a sign that she intends to run for president in 2020, comes after years of controversy over her heritage. Warren has previously said she was part Cherokee and Delaware Indian, based on stories she heard growing up. Her ancestry first became a political issue in 2012, when she ran for Senate in Massachusetts. Critics questioned whether she received any advantages from claiming Native American ancestry — an idea we’ve addressed before (there’s no evidence she benefited). Subsequently, Trump took to calling her “Pocahontas,” and during a rally this past July, challenged her to take a DNA test, saying he would donate $1 million to charity “if you take the test and it shows you’re an Indian.”The new findings support Warren’s claim that she has at least one Native American ancestor, although they cannot reveal whether that individual was a member of any specific tribe. The results were not peer-reviewed, as they would be in a formal scientific publication, but four anthropological geneticists told us the methodologies were valid and the conclusions reasonable.Trump, however, interpreted the findings differently. Over a series of tweets, he called the test “bogus” and said the results showed Warren might have less Native American DNA than the “average American.” Now that her claims of being of Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam and a lie, Elizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetrating this fraud against the American Public. Harvard called her “a person of color” (amazing con), and would not have taken her otherwise!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2018Pocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed. She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her, “DNA test is useless.” Even they don’t want her. Phony!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2018In campaign rallies in Montana, Arizona, Texas and, most recently, Illinois, the president has claimed to be more Native American than Warren.Trump in Murphysboro, Illinois, on Oct. 27: But how do you lose a debate where you say as an example — no, we can’t use Pocahontas anymore. She’s got no Indian blood. We can’t use the name. He says call her Pocahontas. I can’t do it. She doesn’t have any Indian blood. I have more than she does, and I have none. Right? I have none, but it’s more than her. On each of these points, Trump is wrong or comes to an unsubstantiated conclusion:Before explaining more of the science, it’s important to say, as others have done elsewhere, that DNA tests like the one Warren took have no bearing on Native American identity or tribal membership. As a result, even if Warren’s test showed she had a substantial amount of Native American DNA, that would not make her “Native American.” Native identity is socially and culturally determined, and cannot be reduced to a DNA ancestry test. While lineage often matters to tribal membership, it is not established by modern genetic tests that assess overall ancestry. Some, but not all tribes, for example, use a system called “blood quantum,” which requires members to meet certain cutoffs, such as one-quarter or one-half, to officially join as citizens. (This system, it should be noted, began as a forced policy under the federal government, and is therefore viewed as problematic by many.) Other tribes, including the Cherokee Nation, don’t have specific blood quantum requirements, but require proof of descent from an enrolled member in the historical record.For tribes using blood quantum, these fractions do not correspond to an exact percentage of Native American DNA a person might have — thanks to a quirk of biology that we’ll explain later, it’s more variable than that. Instead, they use an approximate value, such as whether an individual has one fully Native parent or grandparent. Tribes might use basic DNA tests, such as paternity tests, in an effort to establish links to certain individuals, but none accepts results from the type of test Warren took.Warren has stated that she understands the difference “between citizenship and ancestry,” and that she is not claiming anything other than ancestry. But many people in indigenous communities, including the Cherokee Nation, found Warren’s decision to release her DNA results offensive. We won’t be wading into that debate any further. Instead, we’ll stick to addressing the scientific claims surrounding Warren’s test.We don’t know all the details about how the test was done because the Stanford geneticist, Carlos Bustamante, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. But based on the released report, the general methods are similar to what would happen if you sent your DNA to a company like 23andMe or Ancestry.com.The technique is a form of genotyping that uses something called a DNA microarray, or what is more popularly known as a DNA chip. The chips are essentially glass microscope slides covered with tiny dots of DNA, and they can reveal a person’s DNA sequence at hundreds of thousands of spots across their genome. These spots, many of which are single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, are useful to check because scientists already know something about them. For one, they’re known to be variable across different populations and between individuals. This is important, since humans share the vast majority of their DNA with each other. Second, the SNPs are usually selected because they tend to associate with certain health conditions, physical features or ancestries. In this way, someone can get a lot of information about their genome without having to sequence it. Sequencing is a different method that reads out the entire string of DNA letters, or bases — all of the A, T, C and Gs — in a given piece of DNA. It is much more expensive than chip-based genotyping, especially when applied to the 3 billion bases of a person’s genome (or 6 billion, if covering both sets of chromosomes).Ancestry information ultimately comes from comparisons of a person’s tested genetic variants to those of other individuals. In Warren’s case, scientists compared 660,173 spots of genetic variation to those of 148 people who had had their entire genomes sequenced as part of the 1000 Genomes Project. The 1000 Genomes Project was a collaborative effort by scientists across the globe to better understand human genetic variation, and involved sequencing more than 2,500 genomes from 26 different populations. These genomes are handy as references genomes, which is how they were used here. Warren’s comparison group was equally split between Europeans, Africans, East Asians and those with Native American ancestry. The analyst made the comparisons using a computer program called RFMix, which Bustamante’s group developed and previously established as a reliable tool.To confirm evidence of Warren’s Native American ancestry, researchers also compared Warren’s DNA data to two other sets of reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project: 99 people from Utah with European ancestry, and 86 people from Great Britain, also with European ancestry.According to the report, Warren’s test results show that she is of “primarily European descent,” but also that she has at least five genetic segments that are “Native American in origin at high confidence.” One of these segments is larger than the others, spanning about 4.7 million bases, and further analysis indicates this DNA chunk has a genetic signature one would expect from a person having European and Native American heritage. The total length of all of Warren’s Native American-assigned segments is about 12.3 million bases, which the report states is about 12.4 times greater than the average in the Great Britain reference population, and 10.5 times greater than the average in the Utah population. Bustamante concludes there is “strong evidence” for a Native American ancestor roughly six to 10 generations ago.All of the anthropological geneticists we consulted felt the test was performed as well as it could have been, given the available data.“Carlos Bustamante is a very respected researcher,” said Jeffrey Long of the University of New Mexico in a phone interview. “What I’ve seen makes sense to me.” (Bustamante is also an adviser to both 23andMe and Ancestry.com. )Long added that while Warren doesn’t appear to have a lot of DNA from a Native American ancestor, it’s “probably proof” there was one, and that the six to 10 generations figure was “appropriately cautious.”“The methods that they used are among the best that are out there today,” said Deborah Bolnick of the University of Connecticut in a phone interview.She said the test still had limitations, largely because of the lack of available Native American data sets, but that the limitations “don’t influence the idea that she had an indigenous ancestor.”For example, in the analysis, the Native American samples came from people from Mexico, Peru and Colombia. Ideally, Warren’s DNA would be compared to that from Native Americans living in the United States — but that data isn’t publicly available. These other samples can still be used, however, because there is enough shared ancestry. Many people living in North and South America today, Bolnick explained, still retain genetic variants that emerged in more ancestral populations, and therefore these people can serve as legitimate comparisons to determine whether an individual descended from the first people of the Americas.While the results are clear on the basic findings, things get murkier when people attempt to extrapolate beyond them.“It’s hard to say more than, ‘Yes, it’s clear she has Native American ancestry,’” said Long.Shortly after Warren’s release, critics began to question whether she has more Native ancestry than other white Americans. Using the six to 10 generations figure, a Republican spokesman and an op-ed writer converted this to fractional ancestry (1/64 to 1/1024), which they then compared to a number appearing in a 2014 study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics. The paper, which was written by 23andMe researchers and colleagues, analyzed the genetic ancestry of more than 160,000 23andMe customers who self-identified as either African American, Latino or European American. For European Americans, the genome-wide “mean estimate” of Native American ancestry was 0.18 percent (given in table 1). Because this percentage is higher than the equivalent percentage for the 10 generations fraction (0.098 percent), these critics concluded Warren might have less Native American ancestry than the “average” white American.Trump appears to have picked up this line of thinking, saying in an Oct. 16 tweet that the test showed that Warren “may be 1/1024, far less than the average American,” and in his Oct. 18 speech in Montana that “the one good thing about her test is that there was so little she had less than the average American.”This is problematic for several reasons, the first being that the Bustamante report never specifies a fraction or percentage, so these estimates are derived from a back calculation from the six to 10 generation estimate. As others have written, this incorrectly assumes equal inheritance through time from all of your ancestors — something that simply doesn’t happen. Biology is more random, and because of the way DNA is passed down, these fractions may not represent the true amount of DNA a person retains from each ancestor.In fact, there is a surprisingly high chance that a person will receive no DNA from a relatively recent ancestor. Graham Coop, an evolutionary and populations geneticist at the University of California, Davis, for example, has estimated there’s about a 13 percent chance a person will not get any genetic material from an ancestor from eight generations ago. At 10 generations, this jumps to about a 50 percent chance. This reveals a fundamental discrepancy between ancestry and genetics, since a person’s ancestry can still be true, and yet they might not have any trace of it in their bodies. Even if we had a more precise estimate of the amount of Native American DNA Warren carries, it still would be inappropriate to use the 23andMe study to come to definitive conclusions about how Warren stacks up.That’s because, Bolnick explained, the 23andMe percentages were calculated using different genetic data and different statistical tools. “They’re not comparable,” she said.Furthermore, because the 23andMe data come from customers, the information is not necessarily representative of all of white America, as this population had the interest in and the means to pay for a genetic test. While this may be the best estimate we have, it’s still not a random sample.“I don’t think it’s way off, but we’re talking about really small numbers here,” cautioned Long.Others have pointed to the Utah reference population — which had on average just a tenth of Native American DNA as Warren’s sample — as a more relevant comparison. But Bolnick and Long don’t think this population is representative of the entire U.S., either.Several of the anthropological geneticists we spoke to also found the entire concept of an “average” Native American ancestry in white Americans questionable, as this ancestry fluctuates a great deal based on geography and past events.In the end, with respect to the “average” claim, Bolnick said, “I don’t think we have enough data to answer whether she does or does not have more.”The most that can be concluded, then, is that Warren’s test results are consistent with someone who has a small amount of Native American ancestry.",false," ancestry, DNA, Native American, "
337,11967,"Insurance companies ""have made a fortune with Obamacare.","October 23, 2017","Trump said insurance companies have made a fortune with Obamacare. The White House cited the companies’ surging profits as proof. But just because insurers made billions since the time when the Affordable Care Act took effect, doesn’t mean that the ACA delivered those profits. Most of the companies had steep losses on the Obamacare exchanges and got out. Every report we saw and every expert we reached said insurers made their huge profits elsewhere, largely through their work in the large group or employer-based market or through the Medicare Advantage program. The expansion of Medicaid, another part of Obamacare also helped, but to a smaller degree. The fortune that Trump cited didn’t come from Obamacare.",Jon Greenberg,"As two dozen senators attempt to carve out a short-term compromise on the Affordable Care Act, President Donald Trump is sending mixed signals. At the heart of the deal are payments to insurance companies that sell certain policies on the Obamacare exchanges. In tweets and remarks, Trump both praised the compromise effort championed by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and flagged his displeasure. ""I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care,"" Trump tweeted Oct. 18. I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care. The bailout, as Trump calls it, is no bailout; the money actually ends up with doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. But here we zero in on Trump’s statement that insurers ""have made a fortune with Obamacare."" There’s no question that the companies’ profits have been enormous. The question is, was Obamacare the cash cow? Based on the filings of the companies, and the analysis of people on Wall Street, at universities and a respected neutral health policy group, the answer is, no. The White House press office pointed to a news article that reported booming profits for the top five for-profit insurance companies, Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Humana and UnitedHealth Group. Collectively, they had $4.5 billion in net earnings in the first three months of 2017. That cash was""the biggest first-quarter haul for the group since the Affordable Care Act exchanges went live in 2014,"" the article said. But the article doesn’t actually tie those profits to Obamacare. The fact is, Obamacare does not just include the exchanges where people buy private insurance. The exchanges themselves are a small slice of the overall insurance business. Despite the enormous attention paid to the exchanges, they make up less than 4 percent of the insurance market for people under 65. And contrary to Trump’s assertion, they have dragged profits down, not boosted them up, experts say. Returns from the exchanges have been so bad, three out of five of the companies listed in the article have fled. Aetna reported that it lost $650 million in 2016 and 2017 from the policies it sold in the individual market. For 2018, Aetna pulled out of every state exchange. UnitedHealth Group has also left the exchanges. It put its combined losses at over $1 billion in 2015 and 2016. Humana, which had sold in 11 states, got out too. Cigna trimmed its participation from seven states to six. Cigna CEO David Cordani told CNBC in August that the market is ""challenging,"" and that ""we are losing money, but we are losing a little less than we expected."" For 2018, Anthem also remains, but withdrew from Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin, and trimmed back the number of counties it serves in Kentucky, Georgia and California. It was going to leave Virginia completely, but then struck a deal with the state to sell in counties that would otherwise have no carrier. Moody’s Investor Service ranked it as a positive development for companies that exited the exchanges, saying it ""lowered exposure to this challenging business."" The overall individual market, which includes plans sold on and off the exchanges, brought an estimated $4.7 billion in underwriting losses in 2016, according to the consulting group Oliver Wyman. The news has not been all bad for the companies. Premium hikes in 2016 and 2017 began to balance things out. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health sector statistics, found that insurers who stayed in the exchanges had figured out how to come out ahead, but it took a couple of years for them to get there. So Trump missed the target completely when he linked the exchanges and the multi-billion dollar profits of five big insurance companies. But Obamacare is much more than the exchanges and parts of the program have both helped and hindered company profits. On the negative side of the ledger, the Affordable Care Act imposed limits on the spread between premiums collected and medical services paid out. For individual and small group plans, companies must spend at least 80 percent of premiums on providing care. For the large-group plans, the percent is 85 percent. ""This provision has likely had a modest downward effect on profits,"" said Larry Levitt with the Kaiser Family Foundation. In 2015, companies that fell below those minimums rebated about $400 million to customers, government numbers show. A tax on insurance companies helps finance Obamacare. Congress lifted it for 2017, but it is slated to return in 2018 with an estimated value of nearly $13 billion. Sheryl R. Skolnick, director of U.S. equity research at Mizuho Securities, tracks UnitedHealth Group specifically. ""That health insurance industry fee in 2018 is projected to cost the company $.75 a share on just about 1 billion shares,"" Skolnik said. On the positive side of the ledger, the one clear bright spot for insurers in Obamacare was the expansion of Medicaid. In the 32 states that extended the program to adults making as much as 138 percent of federal poverty, coverage is mainly handled through private insurers. ""Mostly as a result of expansion programs under the ACA, health plans and service providers experienced strong Medicaid growth over the early years of ACA,"" according to a report from Mark Farrah and Associates. Health care analysts at Milliman, an actuarial consulting firm, estimated that insurers had underwriting gains of $1.5 billion in 2016. That was a year when exchange losses topped $4 billion. A study in Michigan found that operating margins for the companies that managed Medicaid in that state improved four-fold between 2013 and 2015. How does this all add up for each of the five big insurance companies? Precision is difficult, but between the losses tied to the exchanges, regulations and taxes on one hand, and profits on Medicaid on the other, Skolnik said it’s a wash. ""I think it's fair to say that the health insurance industry has probably lost close to as much as they've gotten under the ACA,"" Skolnik said. Which raises the question, where did those hefty profits come from? The bulk of the business lies in employer-based coverage, which makes sense since that accounts for nearly 60 percent of the under-65 insurance market. Over the years, companies have benefited by shifting more of the costs onto customers through higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses. And mergers in the industry have also helped. ""Consolidation among insurers has led to higher margins,"" said economist Amanda Starc at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. Medicare Advantage, a quasi-private version of traditional Medicare, has also been a key profit center for insurers. Under the program, the government contracts with insurance companies to deliver health care to seniors. The rising number of retirements among baby boomers has fueled that market. Enrollments are up, and the insurance companies have worked hard to keep their costs down. ""They are very aggressive there which gives them the clout to get better provider contracts,"" said J.B. Silvers, a professor of health finance at Case Western Reserve University. Trump said insurance companies have made a fortune with Obamacare. The White House cited the companies’ surging profits as proof. But just because insurers made billions since the time when the Affordable Care Act took effect, doesn’t mean that the ACA delivered those profits.

On July 18, CNN published an article with the headline “85 Infants Under Age 1 Have Tested Positive for Coronavirus in One Texas County Since March.” The article reported that: “Eighty-five babies under age 1 have tested positive for coronavirus in one Texas county since mid-March. And local officials are imploring residents to help stop its spread as the state becomes one of the newest hotspots […]. In Texas’ Nueces County, where Corpus Christi is located, the number of new coronavirus cases skyrocketed in July after a flattening trend. The virus has infected dozens of babies and local officials are urging people to wear masks and practice social distancing. “‘We currently have 85 babies under the age of one year in Nueces County that have all tested positive for Covid-19,” said Annette Rodriguez, director of public health for Corpus Christi Nueces County on Friday. ‘These babies have not even had their first birthday yet. Please help us stop the spread of this disease. '” Rodriguez made the remarks during a remote briefing as part of the county’s July 17 COVID-19 update and in the context of urging residents to resume and continue taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus. In the interest of thoroughness, the relevant remarks are quoted in full, and can be watched, below: “I’ve been reviewing our statistics. We currently have 85 babies, under the age of one, here in Nueces County, that have all tested positive for COVID-19. These babies have not even had their first birthday yet. Please help us to stop the spread of this disease. Stay social [sic] distanced from others. Stay protected — wear a mask when in public, and for everyone else, please do your best to stay home.” On July 18, Nueces County Judge Barbara Canales issued a statement in which she clarified that the figure presented by Rodriguez referred to all positive tests among children aged under 1 year since March, rather than the number of currently active cases among children of that age: “On Friday, July 17, during a press conference, a spokesperson mentioned that 85 infants under the age of one had tested positive for coronavirus. This number reflects the cumulative total of positive tests for infants under the age of 1 since the beginning of testing in mid-March, which has resulted in 8,171 positive test results. “For context, the spokesperson was using that statistic to illustrate that no one is naturally immune to this virus. While the elderly and those with existing medical conditions are at greater risk of illness and death, anyone can get the virus, from the elderly to infants, and without regard to race, gender, or economic status. The number was used to illustrate this point. However, without this context, stating this number during our press conference led many to believe that we had a sudden surge in infants under the age of one testing positive. We have NOT had a sudden surge of 85 infants testing positive.” That clarification provided the basis for CNN’s claim, in its headline, that “85 infants under age 1” had tested positive for COVID-19 in Nueces County. However, the clarifying statement itself contained an inaccurate presentation of the true figures. On July 18, Yahoo! News published an article with the headline “85 Children Under Age 2 Tested Positive for Coronavirus in 1 Texas County, as U.S. Sets New Record.” The article reported that: “Rodriguez initially said at a meeting Friday that a review of coronavirus statistics showed that 85 infants have tested positive. She clarified this on Saturday to say that total also includes children between the ages of 1 and 2 years old. The numbers are taken from testing that started on March 21, 2020.” According to Yahoo!

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) It had more than 27,000 likes as of March 18. (Screenshot from Instagram) Early on in the coronavirus pandemic, which had infected more than 179,000 people worldwide as of March 17, we saw a lot of baseless claims pinning the disease on the consumption of bats in China. Cowspiracy’s Instagram post piggybacks on that misinformation. As evidence, it refers to the Instagram account for Ed Winters, a vegan activist based in the United Kingdom. His March 14 post cites the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization to back up his claim about meat consumption causing the COVID-19 outbreak. On its website, the CDC says that ""3 out of every 4 new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals."" And the WHO has said that eating ""raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat"" carries a potential risk for infection from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), another human coronavirus. But neither statement supports the link that the activist draws between COVID-19 and meat-eating. Scientists are still trying to figure out the source of COVID-19, but there is no evidence that the outbreak began because of meat consumption. According to the CDC, COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus similar to MERS and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). All three originate in bats, and the recent COVID-19 outbreak suggests a ""likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir."" Early in the outbreak, many patients in the virus epicenter of Wuhan, China, had connections to a large seafood and live-animal market, which suggested animal-to-person spread. But later cases had no connection to the market, suggesting person-to-person spread. Scientists recently traced the first known case of COVID-19 to November 2019, in a patient with no connection to the market. However, those studies stipulate that ""intermediate hosts"" are needed between bats and humans for the disease to spread — and meat isn’t necessarily part of the equation. For example, scientists first thought the Ebola outbreak started with the consumption of bat meat in Guinea. But Time reported that patient zero was likely infected by bat droppings that contaminated something she put in her mouth. MERS was also primarily spread through contact with live camels as opposed to camel meat. One of the first studies published about COVID-19 by Chinese researchers found that the virus could come from the same bats that were the source of the 2003 SARS outbreak. But the researchers cautioned that it’s ""likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans."" More recent studies of COVID-19 suggest that pangolins, scaly anteaters, could be that intermediate host. The animals are sought-after in China for their meat and scales, despite a worldwide ban. However, scientists have yet to find conclusive proof that pangolins are to blame for the coronavirus. And as of now, there is no evidence that eating meat is the source of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Education Minister Lucia Azzolina said schools and universities all over the country would be closed from Thursday until at least March 15. Only those in the northern regions most heavily affected by the epidemic have been closed so far. The number of cases since the outbreak surfaced 13 days ago rose to 3,089 from 2,502 on Tuesday. Of those who contracted the disease, about 3.5% had died, the head of the agency, Angelo Borrelli, said. The government adopted a decree to try to slow infections which have been rising by about 500 per day. “Our hospitals, despite their efficiency, risk being overwhelmed, we have a problem with intensive-care units,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. The decree orders “the suspension of events of any nature ... that entail the concentration of people and do not allow for a safety distance of at least one metre (yard) to be respected.”  It calls for the closure of cinemas and theatres and tells Italians not to shake hands or hug each other, and to avoid “direct physical contact with all people.”  It also orders all major sporting events, including top flight Serie A soccer matches, to be played in empty stadiums. The school closures caused jubilation among some children and mixed reactions from parents. “I hoped for this decree because I feared an outbreak at school,” said Massimiliano Del Ninno, father of a Rome primary school student. “Even if we are dealing with an age group that doesn’t seem to be at risk, they could have been carriers.”   Clarissa Mazzei, a 30-year-old mother of three, called it “tragic ... for the students, and also for the parents.”  Deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said the government was aware of the problems it would cause families and was preparing a directive to allow a parent to stay home from work to look after children. The virus outbreak remains centred on the wealthy and populous region of Lombardy, around Milan, and the neighbouring regions of Veneto and Emilia Romagna, but cases are spreading around the whole of the Italian peninsula and Sicily. Rome’s Spallanzani infectious diseases hospital said it had 20 coronavirus patients, while others were being treated at home in and around Italy’s capital and largest city. Emilia Romagna’s regional government said on Wednesday two of its members had tested positive and Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli is in self-imposed isolation after coming into contact with a patient, though he himself had tested negative. The outbreak has already heavily disrupted life in the north, with cinemas and museums closed in some regions and many events cancelled including fashion shows and trade fairs.

The report, available at http://www.fastfoodmarketing.org, finds the industry spent more than $4.2 billion in 2009 on marketing and advertising on television, the Internet, social media sites and mobile applications. “Despite pledges to improve their marketing practices, fast food companies seem to be stepping up their efforts to target kids,” Harris said. “Today, preschoolers see 21 percent more fast food ads on TV than they saw in 2003, and somewhat older children see 34 percent more.”   McDonald’s Corp has 13 websites, attracting 365,000 unique child visitors under 12 every month. One, ronald.com, specifically targets preschoolers. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says two-thirds of American adults and 15 percent of children are overweight or obese. In some states, the childhood obesity rate is above 30 percent. U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, spearheading an administration initiative on child obesity, has urged food manufacturers to re-package food so that it is healthier for kids. In 2007, McDonald’s and other large U.S. food and drink companies pledged to adopt stricter controls on advertising to children under 12. “Most restaurants will say that they have added healthier choices to their menus in recent years,” Yale’s Marlene Schwartz, who worked on the study, told the briefing. “In most cases you have to work very hard to get a healthy side or drink in a fast-food restaurant,” Schwartz said. “You have to know it exists and you have to ask for it.”   Burger King in a statement said it “has strengthened its commitment in this area since 2007 by enhancing its nutrition criteria for advertised Kids Meals,” including lowered sodium. McDonald’s said it had kept its promises. “We primarily advertise our popular 375 calorie four-piece Chicken McNugget Happy Meal which includes Apple Dippers, low-fat caramel dip, and a jug of 1 percent low-fat milk,” spokesman Neil Golden said in a statement. The researchers found that teenagers purchased 800 to 1,100 calories, or half a day’s worth, in an average visit. Yale’s Kelly Brownell said state and local governments can rein in the marketing behavior of the restaurants, pointing to San Francisco’s law passed last week that cracks down on giving away toys in children’s meals. Brownell hopes Monday’s report will do more. “There will be a level of anger, even rage perhaps, that will set the stage for legislation and even regulatory action,” he said.",true,Health News
343,29982,Melania Trump was the first First Lady to visit troops in a war zone. ,"December 28, 2018","Several different First Ladies have visited ""war zones,"" ""potential combat zones,"" and other dangerous areas.",Dan Evon,"On 26 December 2018, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump made a surprise visit to Al Asad Air Base in Iraq for a Christmastime meeting with military members who were stationed in the war zone there. Shortly thereafter, a claim began circulating on social media that Melania Trump was the first First Lady to undertake such a trip:  The definition of what constitutes a ‘war zone’ or a ‘combat zone’ is somewhat subjective and therefore variable. Although these terms may invoke images of areas under immediate threat of military attack, we found no record of any first lady’s traveling to or remaining in an area where armed hostilities were actively taking place. These terms are often used to refer to the general areas in which a war is being fought and do not necessarily have strict or well-defined boundaries, as encapsulated in the IRS’ definition of such: The term “combat zone(s)” is a general term … and includes all of the following hostile areas where military may serve: actual combat areas, direct combat support areas, and qualified hazardous duty areas. With respect to deadline extensions, the term “combat zone(s)” includes contingency operations areas. That said, by the standards of contemporaneous reporting, Melania Trump was not the first First Lady to make such a trip. Although our list may not be comprehensive, we found that first ladies Eleanor Roosevelt, Pat Nixon, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, and Laura Bush were all reported during their tenures as having ventured into “war zones” and other potentially dangerous territories as they visited troops stationed overseas. Eleanor Roosevelt, for example, made several trips to war zones during World War II in the 1940s:  The First Lady was allowed to go to Guadalcanal where she visited many hospitals and again made offers to write to the families of wounded soldiers. During the course of her trip she had visited 17 islands and it was estimated that she saw over 400,000 soldiers. In the end Admiral Halsey said, “she had accomplished more good than any other person or any group of civilians that had passed through my area.” For Eleanor Roosevelt, the extensive travels to war zones made her even more determined to try to find a road to lasting world peace after this horrific war was over. She wrote in My Day “if the generation that fights today is to lay the foundations of which a peaceful world can be built, all of us who have seen the war close range must remember what we see and carry a crusading spirit into all of our work.”  First Lady Pat Nixon was also described as having taken part in a “dangerous visit” to “an active combat zone” in Vietnam in 1969:  While neither of Pat Nixon’s sons-in-law saw active duty in South Vietnam, the First Lady herself came close to witnessing it herself. Joining the President on a dangerous visit to the embattled nation, she was the first First Lady to enter an active combat zone since Eleanor Roosevelt. During her time there, Mrs. Nixon spent nearly all of it focused on the troops — both those on break from the field and those being cared for in medic hospital units. Since 1969, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, and Laura Bush have all traveled to military bases overseas to meet with U.S. troops. First Lady Barbara Bush visited Saudi Arabia over Thanksgiving in 1990, in the midst of Operation Desert Shield (the build-up of troops and the defenses of Saudi Arabia at the beginning of the Gulf War): President Bush didn’t come to Saudi Arabia with any guns or missiles, but he had a much more effective secret weapon — Barbara Bush. For homesick American troops celebrating Thanksgiving just 80 miles from the Kuwaiti border, she was everybody’s missing Mom whose smile sent spirits soaring … In a day that took the Bushes and their entourage from Jiddah on the Red Sea to Dhahran on the Persian Gulf, the First Couple ate two holiday turkey dinners and talked to hundreds of men and women in two encampments at secret locations in the desert and on a U.S. ship in the gulf. Mrs. Bush isn’t the only First Lady to visit American troops abroad. Eleanor Roosevelt went to the South Pacific in 1943, and Pat Nixon went with President Nixon to Vietnam in 1969. While Hillary Clinton was First Lady, she traveled to Bosnia in 1996. Although active hostilities in Bosnia had ended a few months prior to her visit, officials still considered the area a “potential” combat zone:  Protected by sharpshooters, Hillary Rodham Clinton swooped into a military zone by Black Hawk helicopter to deliver a personal “thank you, thank you, thank you” to U.S. troops. “They’re making a difference,” the first lady said of the 18,500 Americans working as peacekeepers in Bosnia. Mrs. Clinton became the first presidential spouse since Eleanor Roosevelt to make such an extensive trip into what can be considered a hostile area, although others have visited hot spots. [T]he highlight of her trip was the visits she made to two fortified posts outside the U.S. base in Tuzla. Even President Bill Clinton, restricted to the base by bad weather in January, did not see as much of this war-ravaged region as Mrs. Clinton did. Although Clinton’s trip to Bosnia may have scored her political points during her time as First Lady, that visit would later become a subject of controversy and criticism. During the 2008 presidential campaign Clinton was accused of exaggerating the dangers of her Bosnia visit for saying she had been “under sniper fire” when she landed at the Tuzla Air Base. (It should be noted that when Hillary Clinton’s trip to Bosnia in 1996 was touted as “the first time since Roosevelt that a first lady has voyaged to a potential combat zone,” that claim was similarly debunked.) Laura Bush also visited troops overseas during her time as first lady, paying a brief visit to Afghanistan in 2005:  Under heavy protection in this dusty, dangerous capital, Laura Bush talked with Afghan women freed from Taliban repression and urged greater rights. She expressed high hopes, envisioning a day when tourists would flock here for vacations. There were reminders of war at every turn of Bush’s visit. U.S. soldiers in camouflage fatigues manned M-60 machine guns at both ends of four transport helicopters that flew the first lady and her entourage to events around Kabul. Apache attack helicopters that shadowed the aircraft provided further security.",false,"Politics, hillary clinton, melania trump"

Trump Announces Intent to Nominate and Appoint Personnel to Key Administration Posts,” the President announced, among other things, that he is planning on nominating Dr. Mehmet Oz to a two-year term on the President’s Council on Sport, Fitness, and Nutrition, or PCSFN: President Donald J. Trump today announced his intent to appoint the following individuals to be Members of the President’s Council on Sport, Fitness, and Nutrition for a term of two years: […] Mehmet Oz of New Jersey First established in 1956, the Council “engages, educates, and empowers all Americans to adopt a healthy lifestyle that includes regular physical activity and good nutrition” through the promotion of various programs and initiatives that “motivate people of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities to be active and eat healthy.” Mehmet Oz — known popularly as Dr. Oz — is, like so many other nominees offered by Trump, a television personality. Launched into stardom after appearing on the Oprah Winfrey Show as a health expert in the early 2000s, his medical background is as a cardiothoracic surgeon. He is perhaps known to most, however, for his work promoting alternative cures and dubious pseudoscience through his eponymous Dr. Oz Show. He is best known to Trump, most likely, through his September 2016 appearance on that show where Oz declared that notes allegedly produced by Harold Bornstein (the personal doctor who now claims a clean bill of health issued in his name in 2016 was dictated by Trump himself) were “comprehensive”: If a patient of mine had these records,” Oz said, “I’d be very happy, and I’d send them on their way.” Oz has been criticized by the FTC for promoting dubious products or supplements on his show and was called by Senator Claire McCaskill to testify before the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection in 2014 over his promotion of weight loss cures: “I don’t get why you say this stuff because you know it’s not true,” McCaskill said [to Oz] during Tuesday’s hearing before the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection, which she chairs. “So why, when you have this amazing megaphone and this amazing ability to communicate, why would you cheapen your show by saying things like that?” […] “The scientific community is almost monolithic against you in terms of the efficacy of the three products you call miracles,” McCaskill told Oz. “You may think magic is make-believe, but this little bean has scientists saying they’ve found the magic weight-loss cure for every body type,” he said on his show in 2012 of green coffee extract. The only research supporting that claim at the time was a study, since retracted, that had been funded by the product’s manufacturer. A 2018 analysis of the Dr. Oz Show performed by Health News Reviews concluded that “about 78% of statements made on the Dr. Oz show did not align with evidence-based medical guidelines, society recommendations, or authority statements.” They also documented that much of the show’s content is directly related to the products being advertised during the show’s broadcast: More than half of all recorded shows had content linked directly to advertisements: In the Dr. Oz show: 13 out of 19 (68.4%) shows had ads related to general show content, 11 /19 (57.9%) had specific products mentioned by the host using their commercial name, and 4/11 (36.3%) shows mentioning products by name named more than one product. Dr. Oz has also used his show to give a platform to people widely seen as being part of a pseudoscientific fringe, including people like Dr. Joseph Mercola, the proprietor of a large alternative health web store who has been fined by the FTC for claiming that his tanning beds prevent cancer.",true,"Politics, Council on Sport Fitness and Nutrition, Dr. Oz, health"
352,24871,"John McCain accused Barack Obama ""of letting infants die.","October 9, 2008",Obama ad wrong about McCain abortion charge,Angie Drobnic Holan,"Barack Obama recently released an attack ad on John McCain after Obama's abortion votes in the Illinois state legislature came under attack. The ad says that McCain accused Obama of ""letting infants die."" But we do not find that to be the case. Our story begins with an ad from an independent advocacy group, BornAliveTruth.org, that exists to criticize Obama's votes on abortion when he was a state senator in Illinois. The group's ad shows a young woman, Gianna Jessen, looking directly at the camera and saying the following: ""Can you imagine not giving babies their basic human rights, no matter how they entered our world? My name's Gianna Jessen, born 31 years ago after a failed abortion. But if Barack Obama had his way, I wouldn't be here. Four times Barack Obama voted to oppose a law to protect babies left to die after failed abortions. Senator Obama, please support born alive infant protections. I'm living proof these babies have a right to live."" View the ad here  . The ad refers to Illinois legislation put forward in 2001, 2002 and 2003 by opponents of abortion. The intent was to require doctors to provide immediate life-saving care to any infant that survived an intended abortion. The legislation, which included multiple bills, specified that an infant surviving a planned abortion is ""born alive"" and ""shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law."" The bills' supporters said it gave added emphasis to laws already on the books, deterring the death of abortion survivors from neglect. One of the bills' strongest supporters was a nurse, Jill Stanek, who said she had witnessed infants left to die in dirty utility rooms. Abortion-rights proponents, on the other hand, said the legislation was a back-door attempt to stop legal abortions. Obama voted against the legislation several times. For more on the complicated history of this legislation  read our story here. The Obama campaign has been trying to make inroads with voters who oppose abortion. Though Obama supports the right to abortion, he said he believes the number of abortions performed can and should be reduced. So the campaign released a vigorous response ad to the BornAliveTruth.org ad. But instead of targeting BornAliveTruth.org or Gianna Jessen,  the ad attacks McCain  . ""John McCain's attacks, the sleaziest ads ever. Truly vile. Now, votes taken out of context accusing Obama of letting infants die. It's a despicable lie. Even the bill's Republican sponsor said that it's untrue. Obama's always supported medical care to protect infants. McCain. He's running on a platform to ban abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. Sleazy ads. Anti-choice. That's John McCain."" There are a few problems here. Obama's ad shows footage of the BornAliveTruth.org ad, which the McCain campaign did not produce. So the Obama ad is blaming McCain for an attack he didn't make. The first ad clearly states that BornAliveTruth.org created it, as is required by law. Also, though the Republican Party platform does call for a ban on abortion, McCain himself favors exceptions for rape and incest. (His running mate Sarah Palin has said she opposes those exceptions, but the ad doesn't mention her.) We looked for examples, but could find no cases of McCain accusing Obama of ""letting infants die."" Certainly some antiabortion activists who support McCain have made the charge, but that's quite different from the McCain campaign saying it. McCain's abortion-related attacks usually center on Obama's refusal to confirm conservative judges. We find the claim that McCain made the accusation to be .",false,"Abortion, National, Barack Obama, "

354,9168,Common antibiotic may help to prevent or treat PTSD,"April 10, 2017","This University College London news release describes a complex piece of research that combines cell cultures, human volunteers, a theory that enzymatic proteins called matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors are involved in forming threat memories inherent in PTSD, and that a common antibiotic may prevent their formation by blocking the enzymes. The fact that the research was a theoretical proof-of concept is buried deep in the release so readers might think, based on the headline and earlier paragraphs alone, that the evidence is stronger than it is. The published research article describes some of the uncertainties involved in biopsychological investigations in animal models and people, but the release doesn’t mention any of them, nor does it include any meaningful numbers to describe the benefits. It does raise the issue of the practicality of using drugs to prevent PTSD since no one can predict when a traumatic event will occur. The search for the neurochemical and biological roots of PTSD and other kinds of crippling anxieties is a scientific challenge for good reason. The human “mind” is difficult to access; animal models are notoriously unreliable; and experiments on people designed to induce, evoke, or otherwise probe such trauma may be unethical. The work described here may indeed be an important early step in understanding the role of signaling pathways outside of nerve cells in creating PTSD, and of novel strategies using an already widely available set of drugs to sabotage that role. But a lot more research will be needed to affirm the idea and a release on the research should make that point very clear and very high up in the text. When and if the blocking of a conditioned fear response by a drug is proven, who would want to take a long term drug in case a terrible event befalls them in the future? That would be taking “preventive medicine” to a whole new level.","Joann Rodgers, MS,Edward Ward, MD,Kathlyn Stone","The release makes no mention of costs. It could have addressed cost through information about the relatively inexpensive antibiotic used in the study or by mentioning the social and economic costs of those afflicted with PTSD. Even though the research is called a “proof of concept,” we think if it’s not too soon to issue a news release it shouldn’t be too early to include cost implications. It’s not clear from the release how statistically strong the results are. The release notes that volunteers taking the antibiotic had a 60% lower fear response in the first session compared to those who took the placebo, “suggesting that the fear memory was significantly suppressed by the drug.” But that number is an average response rate in the treated group and we’d like to see some actual numbers — the number of responses and the range of responses — to assess how many people were helped and to what degree. The article published in Molecular Psychiatry also reports only the approximate percentage of study volunteers who experienced a reduced reaction to the fear marker, so there are no absolute numbers that could be taken from the study and used in the news release. However, communications staff and journalists are the eyes and ears for readers and it behooves them to seek clarity from the authors of research. One of the investigators is quoted acknowledging the challenges inherent in using drugs like doxycycline to prevent PTSD, but there is no mention in the release about the many serious adverse side effects and drug interactions that come with the use of tetracycline antibiotics. Doxycycline has been tried long-term for aortic aneurysms (as a matrix metalloproteinase or MMP inhibitor, the same reason it was tried here) and as an antibiotic for acne, recurrent urinary infections and other conditions. Although generally considered safe to use, over a long term it can cause allergic rashes, antibiotic resistance, changes in friendly gut bacteria, possible weight gain and other problems. While the release explains that the subjects were all healthy volunteers and that the study was a randomized,  placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involving computer simulation, it doesn’t give us much information about the strengths and weaknesses of the research. The primary outcome the researchers sought to measure — startle response — was never really described. The release doesn’t engage in disease mongering. It provides some context about what PTSD is and what causes it. Some context about the rate of PTSD in certain populations (e.g. combat veterans, terrorist attack survivors, children of war) and methods currently used to prevent or treat the condition might also have been helpful to include. The release notes the funding sources and the study stated that there were no conflicts of interest. The release doesn’t mention any of the other treatment strategies for PTSD or show how this drug might compare with them. One other drug that’s been studied for its use in the blocking of learning conditioned fear is the beta blocking blood pressure drug propanolol. The release notes that “more realistic models” of clinical PTSD are needed and any testing of doxycycline in those models is years away. The release claims novelty through this statement by the study author: “We have demonstrated a proof-of-principle for an entirely new treatment strategy for PTSD,” explains Professor Bach. “The theory is based on the recent discovery that our brains need proteins outside nerve cells, called matrix enzymes, to form memories.” However, the current study is not the first to identify a drug that may block fear learning, as noted above under the “alternatives” criteria. The release doesn’t include any sensational, unjustifiable language.",false,"antibiotic,PTSD,University College London"
356,8515,Russian border becomes China's frontline in fight against second virus wave.,"April 13, 2020",China’s northeastern border with Russia has become a frontline in the fight against a resurgence of the coronavirus epidemic as  new daily cases rose to the highest in nearly six weeks - with more than 90% involving people coming from abroad.,"Yew Lun Tian, Huizhong Wu","Having largely stamped out domestic transmission of the disease, China has been slowly easing curbs on movement as it tries to get its economy back on track, but there are fears that a rise in imported cases could spark a second wave of COVID-19. A total of 108 new coronavirus cases were reported in mainland China on Sunday, up from 99 a day earlier, marking the highest daily tally since March 5. Imported cases accounted for a record 98. Half involved Chinese nationals returning from Russia’s Far Eastern Federal District, home to the city of Vladivostok, who re-entered China through border crossings in Heilongjiang province. “Our little town here, we thought it was the safest place,” said a resident of the border city of Suifenhe, who only gave his surname as Zhu. “Some Chinese citizens - they want to come back, but it’s not very sensible, what are you doing coming here for?”  The border is closed, except to Chinese nationals, and the land route through the city had become one of few options available for people trying to return home after Russia stopped flights to China except for those evacuating people. Streets in Suifenhe were virtually empty on Sunday evening due to restrictions on movement and gatherings announced last week, when authorities took preventative measures similar to those imposed in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the pandemic ripping round the world first emerged late last year. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China stood at 82,160 as of Sunday. At the peak of the first wave of the epidemic on Feb 12 there were over 15,000 new cases, though that was a one-off spike following the deployment of new testing methods. Though the number of daily infections across China has dropped sharply from that peak, China has seen the daily toll creep higher after hitting a trough on March 12 because of the rise in imported cases. Chinese cities near the Russian frontier are tightening border controls and imposing stricter quarantines in response. Suifenhe and Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang, are now mandating 28 days of quarantine as well as nucleic acid and antibody tests for all arrivals from abroad. In Shanghai, authorities found that 60 people who arrived on Aeroflot flight SU208 from Moscow on April 10 have the coronavirus, Zheng Jin, a spokeswoman for the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, told a press conference on Monday. Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the  Center for Diseases Prevention and Control in Beijing, said the trend for local transmission of the disease in the capital was low. “Imported cases are still the highest risk in Beijing in the second half of April,” Pang said, adding that nearly 8% of the 40,000 nucleic acid tests carried out in the city since April 1 had been conducted on people who had come from abroad. China has cut the number of people crossing its borders by 90% and has tried to stop all non-essential journeys, said Liu Haitao, an immigration official, at a separate briefing. “Our border is long, and apart from the border crossings and passages, there are a large number of mountain passes, paths, ferry crossings and small roads, and the situation is very complicated,” he said. Residents in Suifenhe said a lot of people had left the city  fearing contagion, but others put their trust in authorities’ containment measures. “I don’t need to worry,” Zhao Wei, another Suifenhe resident, told Reuters. “If there’s a local transmission, I would, but there’s not a single one. They’re all from the border, but they’ve all been sent to quarantine.”",true,Health News
357,8068,"With U.S. hit by virus, China courts Latin America with medical diplomacy.","March 26, 2020","As Argentina was scrambling to introduce emergency measures to insulate its ailing economy from the coronavirus last week, the Chinese ambassador paid a visit to the home of President Alberto Fernandez to discuss an offer.",Cassandra Garrison,"At the meeting in the wealthy Olivos suburb of Buenos Aires, ambassador Zou Xiaoli laid out how the Asian giant was ready to help Argentina face the pandemic: donating masks, gloves, thermometers and protective suits. The donations, welcomed by Fernandez’s government, show how China is leveraging its production of medical equipment and expertise in halting the coronavirus as a soft-power tool in regions like South America, where it is jostling for influence against the United States. From Argentina to Mexico, Brazil to Peru, Latin American nations have accepted offers of support from China as the number of coronavirus cases across the region has climbed, amid growing fears about the preparedness of their healthcare systems. There have been nearly 500,000 confirmed cases worldwide of the virus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, and over 20,000 deaths. Although South America has so far not been as hard hit as other parts of the world, experts fear that may change as winter arrives in the southern hemisphere. “Some countries in the region have reached out to China asking for help,” a Chinese official in Buenos Aires, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. “We will share with them our experience in combating COVID-19 and offer sanitary materials within our capacity.”  As trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have simmered in recent years, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has warned Latin American nations that they should be wary of becoming too economically reliant on China - to little avail. In Argentina, the region’s third-largest economy, China has made steady in-roads, from solar power investments to the construction of a new space monitoring station. It has supplied over $17 billion of financing since 2007, Inter-American Dialogue data shows. China has also become the top consumer of Argentine soybeans and beef. As the coronavirus spread in China, Argentina’s new left-leaning leader Fernandez - who took office in December - exchanged correspondence with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In letters seen by Reuters, Fernandez offered solidarity to China in February as the virus raged from the outbreak center of Wuhan. In March, Xi replied that the situation in China was improving and he called for a deepening of ties between the two nations. Days later, the Chinese embassy announced its donations, posting pictures on Twitter of large trucks carrying a mobile hospital that was set up within a military base near the Argentine capital. “China will continue to help in all possible channels. Long live friendship!” the embassy said on Twitter. The help came at a difficult time for Argentina, which is grappling with a severe economic crisis and re-negotiating $110 billion in foreign debt with creditors, including the International Monetary Fund. “This is part of the link we have with China, which is a solid relationship of mutual respect and ties that go beyond strong trade,” a spokesman for Argentina’s foreign ministry told Reuters, when asked about the donations. China’s aid to Latin America reflects a broader global trend, as Beijing looks to steer the narrative away from it being the country where the coronavirus started and was initially downplayed. Instead, China wants to be seen as spearheading the global fight against the pandemic, experts say. Luo Zhaohui, a vice minister at China’s foreign ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday that the country would “ride out the storm with people from other countries, strengthen cooperation and strive to win the last victory in the fight against the virus.”  While Trump has been criticized by opponents for branding the pandemic ‘the Chinese virus,’ China has won praise among Latin American governments that have accepted its help. The Chinese government said it has supplied test kits, protective suits and other forms of medical aid to more than 80 countries and international organizations. “It’s remarkable and a credit, in a way, to China’s own commanding control of information that it’s been able to re-envision itself as a leader in the fight against coronavirus globally,” said Margaret Myers, director of the China and Latin American program at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue. Myers said the recent re-start of Chinese industry, as cases have subsided, has enabled the country to be a provider of key products as the rest of the world’s production slows. “This will create opportunities for China in the coming years,” she said. The United States, meanwhile, is struggling with its own battle to contain the virus, with the World Health Organization warning on Tuesday that the country could become a new epicenter of the crisis. Before the epidemic hit hardest, Washington in February pledged $100 million towards international efforts in combating COVID-19, including for developing nations. A regional breakdown of that funding was not immediately available. In Latin America, China’s hands-on approach has been well received. Chile, which has among the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the region, has sought advice from Chinese health officials to guide its response and is sending an air force plane to China to pick up donated supplies, including tests and respiratory equipment, Chile’s health minister said. In Mexico, officials have said they are awaiting 300 ventilators from China, crucial yet scarce equipment in treating patients, while in Panama, government health officials heralded a video conference with Chinese experts to work on strategy, something China has done with more than 100 countries. In Venezuela, the government of President Nicolas Maduro said China would send protective gear for health professionals and coronavirus test kits. The country has also opened talks with China over possible financial support. “Thank you China for cooperation and solidarity with Ecuador!” the country’s Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner wrote on Twitter, itemizing help from China that he said included 40,000 surgical masks, infrared thermometers, and protective suits. In Brazil, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has moved quickly to heal a diplomatic rift with China and Chinese officials have said Beijing would assist with medical supplies and technical assistance.

363,24820,Senator McCain would pay for part of his (health care) plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare — $882-billion worth.,"December 3, 2008",Obama knows McCain's intentions better than McCain?,Adriel Bettelheim,"(Published Oct. 20, 2008) Though both presidential candidates have spoken at length about how they would change the American health system, they’ve carefully avoided offering many specifics about Medicare, the government’s huge health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. For good reason: Medicare is financially unprepared for the surge of retiring baby boomers, meaning future administrations and Congresses will have to consider making tough tradoffs, like cutting benefits or raising taxes. That’s hardly the kind of stuff a politician would willingly highlight in stump speeches or on a campaign Web site. It is the sort of thing you just might accuse your opponent of favoring. And Barack Obama in recent days has tried to do just that, portraying John McCain’s health plan as filled with looming spending cuts for Medicare’s nearly 45-million beneficiaries. ""It turns out, Senator McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare — $882-billion worth. $882-billion in Medicare cuts to pay for an ill-conceived health care plan, even as Medicare already faces a looming shortfall,"" Obama said in an Oct. 17, 2008, speech in Roanoke, Va. He repeated the charge the next day, in St. Louis, declaring that under McCain’s plan, “you would have fewer places to get care, and less freedom to choose your doctors. You’ll pay more for your drugs, receive fewer services, and get lower quality care.”     The Obama campaign also has turned the charge into a TV ad. Obama might be hitting hard on a sensitive topic, but in the process, he’s offering more specifics about McCain’s plan than McCain has. The $882-billion in cuts Obama cites comes from an analysis of McCain’s plan by the Center for American Progress Fund, a left-leaning think tank headed by John D. Podesta, the former chief of staff to President Clinton. The analysis, in turn, is based on an estimate by the independent Tax Policy Center that finds McCain’s overall health plan would cost the government $1.3-trillion over 10 years — a figure the McCain campaign doesn’t dispute. Because McCain’s campaign says the health plan would be “budget neutral” — meaning it would be paid for by savings from Medicare and Medicaid — the Center for American Progress automatically assumes the savings would come from cuts to the big health programs. The center performed a series of calculations to determine how much McCain would have to reduce both programs’ projected spending growth, and concluded McCain would have to pare the program by roughly 13 percent over a decade, or $882-billion. All fine, except that McCain has never talked about Medicare benefit and service cuts to pay for his health care plan. Instead, his campaign says it would achieve the necessary cost savings by overhauling Medicare reimbursement policies, streamlining treatments for certain chronic diseases, cracking down on fraud and waste, expanding the use of lower-cost generic drugs and assorted other steps. McCain’s senior policy adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin has talked about further policy changes, including extending tax credits so some low-income Americans wouldn’t have to enroll in Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor. But he has stressed that the cost of these changes could be covered without cutting benefits or services. McCain’s campaign responded to Obama's Roanoke remarks, saying the Democratic front-runner was committing “Medicare malpractice” and spreading lies by perpetuating the Center for American Progress Fund analysis. It’s unclear whether McCain could extract sufficient savings using the methods he’s outlined to achieve his ""budget neutral"" goal. Still, the Center for American Progress Fund analysis flatly assumes McCain will cut Medicare benefits and services when McCain has not even broached the idea in speeches or statements. Obama is overstepping by repeating the analysis’ conclusion and portraying the dollar amount of the cuts as part and parcel of McCain’s plan.

364,33739,"Disney arranged to have himself frozen in cryonic chamber full of liquid nitrogen upon his death,","October 19, 1995","Half a century onwards, the rumor that Walt Disney's body was put in cryonic storage remains one of the most enduring legends about the entertainment giant.",David Mikkelson,"Walt Disney’s health had been deteriorating for many months before he finally agreed to enter St. Joseph hospital in California on 2 November 1966, for tests concerning the pain in his leg and neck. Doctors discovered a walnut-sized spot on the x-ray of his left lung and advised immediate surgery. Disney left the hospital to attend to studio business for a few days, then re-entered St. Joseph on Sunday, November 6, for surgery the next day. During Monday morning’s operation, doctors found his left lung to be cancerous and removed it. His oversized lymph nodes were an indication that Disney hadn’t much longer to live. After two weeks of post-operative care, Disney was released from the hospital. He crossed the street to his studios and spent another ten days tending to studio business and visiting relatives before he grew too weak and had to return to St. Joseph on November 30. His health started to fail even more rapidly than expected, and drugs and cobalt treatments sapped what little strength he had left. Walt Disney died two weeks later when his circulatory system collapsed on the morning of December 15, 1966. In the decades since Walt Disney’s death, the claim that he arranged for his body to be frozen has become ubiquitous. Nearly everyone familiar with the name ‘Walt Disney’ has heard the story that Disney’s corpse is stored in a deep-freeze chamber somewhere — directly under Disneyland’s “Pirates of the Caribbean” attraction is the most frequently mentioned site — awaiting the day when science could repair the damage to his body and bring ‘Uncle Walt’ back to life. Was Walt Disney aware of the possibilities of life extension through cryogenics? He certainly could have been aware of the progress being made in cryogenics research. Numerous articles and books on hypothermia and the preservation of animal tissue through freezing appeared in both the scientific/medical and general press in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s. Anyone with an interest in the subject could easily have located this reading material, and even someone without a particular interest in the subject may have run across one or more articles on the topic in the general press. The subject of cryonics was further brought to the public’s attention with the publication in 1964 of Robert C.W. Ettinger’s book, The Prospect of Immortality. Ettinger’s book, drawing on much of the available literature about cryonics, covered the practical, legal, ethical, and moral impact of freezing and reviving human beings. Ettinger, while admitting that science had as yet no way of reviving frozen human beings, was unflaggingly optimistic that a viable means of reanimation would eventually be found, telling his readers: The fact: At very low temperatures it is possible, right now, to preserve dead people with essentially no deterioration, indefinitely. The assumption: If civilization endures, medical science should eventually be able to repair almost any damage to the human body, including freezing damage and senile debility or other cause of death. Hence we need only arrange to have our bodies, after we die, stored in suitable freezers against the time when science may be able to help us. No matter what kills us, whether old age or disease, and even if freezing techniques are still crude when we die, sooner or later our friends of the future should be equal to the task of reviving and curing us. Given the prevalence of articles published about cryonics in the mid-1960’s, and the relative popularity of Ettinger’s book among science buffs (even if few of them had actually read it), it is certainly possible that Walt Disney was aware of the potentiality of cryonic storage of humans. Whatever the possibilities, however, there is no documentary evidence to suggest that Walt Disney was interested in, or had even heard of, cryonics. Documentation of Disney’s alleged fascination with preserving or extending his life through cryonics did not appear until decades after his death, and what little information is available has predominantly been provided by some extremely questionable sources. Claims about Disney’s interest come primarily from two of the more recent Disney biographies: Robert Mosley’s 1986 effort,Disney’s World, and Marc Eliot’s 1993 entry, Walt Disney — Hollywood’s Dark Prince. Both books have been largely discredited for containing numerous factual errors and undocumented assertions, rendering them rather untrustworthy as sources of reliable background material. Eliot’s biography, which dwells unrelentingly on every salacious incident and rumor connected with Walt Disney’s name, is fairly easy to dismiss. Charitably described as “speculative,” it contains a single passage concerning Walt Disney’s alleged interest in cryonics: Disney’s growing preoccupation with his own mortality also led him to explore the science of cryogenics, the freezing of an aging or ill person until such time as the human body can be revived and restored to health. Disney often mused to Roy about the notion of perhaps having himself frozen, an idea which received … indulgent nods from his brother … Not surprisingly, the source behind this piece of information is nowhere to be found in Eliot’s notes. And as there is no record of Roy ever having spoken of his brother’s alleged interest in cryonics, Eliot’s “source” was likely nothing more than repetition of rumor. Mosley’s Disney’s World is also rather long on rumor and short on facts. The book has been described as “poorly researched and filled with inaccuracies”, a biography that seemed “to promote certain preset points of view, regardless of evidence”. The same critique goes on to say, “One of its central themes, for example, is Disney’s fascination with cryogenesis and the strong suggestion that his body was frozen following his death. It makes for titillating reading; however, few facts support Mosley’s claims”. Disney’s World paints a picture of an anxious Walt Disney desperately searching for a way to spring back to life in order to prevent or correct the horrible mistakes his followers were bound to make in turning his EPCOT dream into reality: [T]he chief problem that troubled Walt was the length of time it might take the doctors to perfect the process. How long would it be before the surgical experts could bring a treated cadaver back to working life? To be brutally practical, could it be guaranteed, in fact, that he could be brought back in time to rectify the mistakes his successors would almost certainly start making at EPCOT the moment he was dead? Mosley’s book is filled with repetitions of the claim that Walt Disney grew increasingly interested in cryonics as his health waned in late 1966, such as this paragraph: It was about this time that Walt Disney became acquainted with the experiments into the process known as cryogenesis, or what one newspaper termed “the freeze-drying of the human cadaver after death, for eventual resuscitation.” Mosley’s statements regarding Disney’s belief in the feasibility of cryonics are somewhat difficult to take seriously, given that his book includes such ludicrously erroneous (or fabricated) statements as: The surgeons had taken away his diseased lung to examine it, and then were going to preserve it. Walt was pleased when he heard that. He knew enough about cryogenesis by now to be aware that it was important to hold onto all the organs — just in case the surgeons needed to treat them before putting them back where they belonged. (Samples of tissue removed during cancer surgery are preserved in formaldehyde, a method of “preservation” which, while useful for microscopy studies, damages the tissue biologically. Organs removed from Disney by his surgeons could never be “put back where they belonged”, no matter what the treatment.) Mosley provides no source for his statements, other than to assert that Disney’s “closest colleagues and advisers” were “confident” that Walt Disney “eventually became convinced of cryogenesis as a viable medical process and was persuaded that, even in 1966, it was possible for a human being to have himself brought back to life after death”. In fact, these “close colleagues” of Disney’s turned out to be a few employees on the periphery of the Disney organization who had never spoken to Walt about cryonics, and were merely repeating the same decades-old rumor for Mosley’s benefit. On the other hand, someone much closer to Walt Disney, his daughter, Diane wrote in 1972: “There is absolutely no truth to the rumor that my father, Walt Disney, wished to be frozen. I doubt that my father had ever heard of cryonics.” Despite the persistent rumors, available documentation indicates that Walt Disney was in fact cremated. Although Disney’s preferences regarding the disposal of his body are not public record (instructions or provisions for his funeral and burial were not included in his will), other publicly-available material is entirely consistent with the claim that he was cremated: o Walt Disney publicly stated — ten years before his death — that he wished not to have a funeral. o Disney family members have confirmed that cremation was Walt’s wish. o Disney’s death certificate shows that he was cremated two days after his death. The name, license number, and signature of the enbalmer appearing on the death certificate are those of a real enbalmer who was employed at the Forest Lawn mortuary at the time. o A marked burial plot for Walt Disney (and other family members) can be found at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale (the logical resting grounds for someone whose cremation was handled by Forest Lawn’s mortuary), and court papers indicate that the Disney estate paid $40,000 to Forest Lawn for interment property. Since Disney’s demise, several unmremarkable events and circumstances surrounding his life and death have been combined to try to establish a pattern of mystery and secrecy concerning the disposal of his body. All of these events, however, have straightforward, non-mysterious explanations: o “Disney had a long preoccupation with death” o “Disney had a neurotic fear of death” Statements concerning Disney’s alleged preoccupation with death are generally attempts to sensationalize the topic by distorting the facts. Although he did worry about dying prematurely, Disney was not “obsessed with death”. Supposedly having been told by a fortune-teller that he would die when he was thirty-five, Disney reportedly brooded about his inevitable demise during occasional bouts of depression, even after he had long passed the allegedly fatal age. Contemplating one’s mortality is not an unusual behavior, and there is no evidence that Walt Disney did so to an excessive degree. William Poundstone quotes some ridiculous passages from Anthony Haden-Guest’s The Paradise Program to try to establish Disney’s preoccupation with death, detailing a “gruesome seven minute Mickey Mouse cartoon” made in 1933 in which “a mad scientist tries to cut off Pluto’s head and put in on a chicken. The cartoon in question is The Mad Doctor, which was nothing more than humorous spoof of 1930’s horror films. Even in the cartoon itself the “horrific” events are not portrayed as real: the whole episode turns out to be nothing more than a nightmare of Mickey’s. Although Poundstone wrote that the film was pulled from the Rank film library in 1970, it has been readily available on home video releases since then. o “The news of Disney’s death was deliberately delayed.” This claim that the announcement of Walt Disney’s death was deliberately withheld from the press for several hours has been made most persistently, presumably because Disney’s aides would have needed time to furtively whisk his body away from the hospital to the secret cryogenic chamber before the presence of reporters made the task impossible to accomplish in privacy. Leonard Mosley’s description of the event features some of more absurd stretches of truth made in this regard: And this is where the mystery begins. It was Walt himself who had asked Roy Disney to keep his illness secret, but the manner in which the world was apprised of his death remains surprising. In fact, it was not until hours after he was declared dead that an announcement was made. First came radio announcements, then a curt official notice informed the press and public that Walt Disney was no more. It added that there would be no funeral. He had already been cremated, the announcement said, and his ashes interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Only immediate family members had been present. It is true that Disney’s death was not officially announced to the press until several hours after it occurred at 9:30 AM on Thursday, December 15, 1966, but the reasons behind the delay were perfectly ordinary ones. First of all, Disney’s death would not have been announced immediately under any circumstances: Several family members had to be notified before a public announcement could be made, and Disney studio executives had to be located and informed that the head of their organization had passed away before the information would be released to the press. Additionally, the gravity of Disney’s illness had largely been kept a secret from the press, so there were no hordes of reporters crowding the hallways of St. Joseph Hospital, waiting for the inevitable announcement of his death. The reason for Disney’s original hospitalization had been announced to the press as “treatment of an old neck injury received while playing polo,” and when Disney re-entered the hospital for the final time two weeks before his death, the statement made to the press was that Disney was undergoing “a routine post-operative” checkup. Although it was certainly no secret that Disney was quite ill, the seriousness of his condition was not generally known. The extent to which the details of Walt Disney’s illness were kept from the press are evidenced by the newspapers reports of his death, which stated that his left lung had been removed during an operation on November 21 (an error which Poundstone repeats in Big Secrets). That operation had actually taken place two weeks earlier; November 21 was the date of his original post-surgery release from the hospital. So, given that relatives and studio heads had to be notified before any statements about Disney’s death were made to the press; that the media were not on a “Disney death watch,” busily preparing obituaries and tributes; and that communications in 1966 were certainly slower than they are today, it is not at all surprising that official news of Disney’s death did not reach the public until a few hours later. Mosley’s other statements, about Disney’s funeral and cremation, are just further examples of sloppy research on his part. Disney was not cremated until two days after his death; no press announcement made “hours after he was declared dead” claimed that he had already been cremated. o “The cause of Disney’s demise was never formally announced.” This statement is both inaccurate and irrelevant. The cause of Disney’s death was initially announced as being “acute circulatory collapse,” which meant simply that his heart had stopped beating. As facile as the official announcement may seem to those who know he “really” died of lung cancer, it does reflect the proximate cause of his death. This notion is borne out by the official death certificate, which lists “cardiac arrest” as the primary cause of death. The fact that cancer was what caused Disney’s heart to give out was, medically, of secondary importance. Official statements released to the press after Disney’s surgery (and before his death) had already revealed that a tumor had been found, necessitating the removal of a lung. Whether stated “officially” or not, it was quite clear to the public that Disney had died of lung cancer. In any case, what possible difference could it have made what Walt Disney died of? How could dissembling about the “real” cause of his death possibly have facilitated the goal of secretly storing his body in a cryonic chamber? o “Disney’s funeral services were held in secret.” Disney’s funeral was not “secret”; rather, it was private, conducted quickly and quietly at the Little Church of the Flowers in Forest Lawn Cemetery, Glendale at 5:00 PM on Friday, December 16 (the day after his death). No announcement of the funeral was made until after it had taken place, no associates or executives from Disney Studios were invited, and only immediate family members were in attendance. Forest Lawn officials refused to disclose any details of the funeral or disposition of the body, stating only that “Mr. Disney’s wishes were very specific and had been spelled out in great detail.”. None of this secrecy surrounding Disney’s funeral should be the least bit surprising to anyone, however. The biography The Story of Walt Disney (essentially an autobiography in which Disney’s own words and thoughts were attributed to his daughter Diane), written a decade before Disney’s death, noted that: [Walt] never goes to a funeral if he can help it. If he had to go to one it plunges him into a reverie which lasts for hours after he’s home. At such times he says, ‘When I’m dead I don’t want a funeral. I want people to remember me alive. '” Is it so remarkable that a man who had an aversion to funerals — and who had stated a ten years earlier that he didn’t want a public funeral — was sent off with a very quick and very private ceremony? If the clandestineness of the funeral had been intended to cover up the fact that Disney’s body had already been deposited in liquid nitrogen at a secret facility, there were certainly better, less obvious ways of accomplishing the deception: Disney could have been given a simple closed-casket ceremony, with nobody the wiser. o “Disney specified the public was never to be told the location of his grave.” Again, this claim is unsupported by any factual information and is not the least bit extraordinary. It is true that officials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park will not divulge the location of the Disney family plot. Many celebrities do request that the locations of their burial plots not be given out to visitors as a simple matter of privacy. The burial sites are not intended to be “secret,” however; if they were, they wouldn’t be marked and located on publicly-accessible grounds. Disney’s plot was not, as Mosley claimed, “already filled with family ashes from which the public would always be barred.” Disney’s plot is far from obtrusive, but it is located in an unrestricted part of the park and marked with a plaque identifying its occupants; anyone who so desires is perfectly free to visit, leave flowers, take photographs, etc. The plot was certainly not “already filled with family ashes” at the time of Disney’s interment, as for many it held the remains of only one other person: Ron Brown, a son-in-law who died the year after Disney did. In fact, according to the book Wills of the Rich and Famous, the interment property was not even chosen until September 19, 1967, making it rather difficult to believe that it could have been “already filled with family ashes.”  If Disney was not really frozen, then how and when did this rumor originate? The exact origins of the rumor are unknown, but at least one Disney publicist has suggested that the story was started by a group of Disney Studio animators who “had a bizarre sense of humor.” The earliest known printed version of the rumor appeared in the magazine Ici Paris in 1969. Even if the origins of the story are unknown, it is certainly easy to see why the rumor is so believable. In the years immediately preceding his death, Disney was involved in a number of projects which cemented his image as a technical innovator in the public’s mind. Disneyland attractions such as the monorail, the House of the Future, the Voyage to the Moon; the introduction of audio-animatronic figures at the 1964 World’s Fair, and Disney’s plans for his “community of tomorrow” (EPCOT) in Florida made it easy to believe Walt Disney was ahead of everyone else in his planning, even when it came to his death. When you consider that the first cryonic suspension took place just a month after Disney’s death (Dr. James Bedford, a 73-year-old psychologist from Glendale, was suspended on January 12, 1967), it’s not so far-fetched to imagine that Disney might have made similar arrangements.",false,"Disney, Walt Disney"

But after a year of talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), agriculture is emerging as one of the most difficult areas. The European Union has ruled out importing meat from animals injected with hormones and said that it will not simply open the door to GM crops. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said difficult issues needed to be addressed, with the common goal of opening markets and eliminating “non-scientific barriers”. “Science is a common language ... We will be working towards making sure that whatever agreements are reached, they are consistent with sound science,” he told a media briefing during a visit to Brussels. In the case of GM crops, the EU has cleared for import some 50 of about 450 commercial strains. The bloc takes in about 30 million tonnes a year for its cattle, pigs and poultry, but EU retailers hardly stock any GM food because of widespread consumer resistance. Vilsack said it was not acceptable that it took four years or more for GM strains to gain access to European markets after winning clearance from the European Food Safety Authority. That compared with a U.S. norm of about 18 months. The United States is demanding the regulatory process be harmonized. Ecological group Greenpeace says GM crops are part of large-scale intensive farming which degrades soils and pollutes water. It says they create herbicide-resistant superweeds that require more pesticides and are not proven to be safe to eat, with much of the research funding coming from industry. Vilsack said the U.S. government was very concerned about suggestions that GM products posed a safety risk, which he said was not borne out by science. Labelling, suggested by some in Europe, would not be a solution, he said. U.S. labels, he said, typically concerned nutritional information or carried a specific warning, for example to alert those with a peanut allergy. Insisting on a label indicating a foodstuff contained a GM product risked sending a wrong impression that this was a safety issue, he said. Vilsack said smartphones might offer an eventual solution by allowing consumers who wanted extensive information, such as on GM content, to gain access to it by scanning a barcode in a supermarket. Vilsack said the European Union should also rethink its current bans on chlorine-washed chicken and beef from cattle raised with growth hormones. Only last month German Chancellor Angela Merkel ruled out imports of the former. But Vilsack said the chlorine treatment was a safe way of reducing pathogens. He added that a deal struck with the EU to allow in a quota of hormone-free U.S. beef to settle a dispute at the World Trade Organization was not a permanent solution. “We are still going to have to have some conversation about the beef question,” he said.",true,Environment

""What we’ve done in Virginia is we have become the number one state per capita in screening out people with mental illness from gun purchases,"" Cuccinelli said during a Sept. 25 debate with Democrat Terry McAuliffe. We wondered if Virginia really is No. 1. To support his statement, Cuccinelli campaign spokeswoman Anna Nix pointed to a chart in the Seattle Times that ranked states on that measure.The chart was based on figures compiled by Mayors Against Illegal Guns -- a gun control group started by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Those figures show Virginia had submitted 2,254 mental health records to the national background check system for every 100,000 residents in the state. That was the highest ratio among all states in late 2011. The gun control group said in a November 2011 version of its Fatal Gaps report that Virginia had been sharing records with the national background check database for a decade, but the volume of records shared increased after the 2007 Virginia Tech tragedy. In that case, Seung-Hui Cho, was able to purchase two handguns he used to kill 32 people despite going through federal and state background checks at licensed gun dealers, according to a 2009 panel report on the shooting to then Gov. Tim Kaine. Cho had been deemed a danger to himself by a Virginia court, and that normally would have made him ineligible to buy the weapons. But his information was not shared with the federal National Instant Background Check System, the panel said, because of ambiguities in Virginia’s guns laws. The Virginia Tech shootings sparked a nationwide examination of the national background check system. Congress passed a 2008 law providing incentives for states to submit mental health records to the national background check system, but they are under no requirement comply. Virginia also passed legislation expanding the mental health records that have to be sent to the federal and state background check databases. Mayors Against Illegal Guns notes on its interactive chart that in the wake of the massacre, Virginia became the national leader in submitting mental health records to the national background check system. It remained at the top of the group’s list until October 2012, Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in an e-mail. Since, then, however, Pennsylvania has vaulted from the bottom of the pack to the top. That month, according to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, the Pennsylvania State Police resolved lengthy legal and technical problems and transmitted 643,167 mental health records to the NICS. The submission means that Pennsylvania has submitted about 5,003 mental health records to the national background check system per 100,000 residents. Virginia was a distant No. 2 in the latest report by the mayors’ group, which counts all submissions through Oct. 31, 2012. Virginia had sent 180,338 mental health records to NICS. That breaks down to about 2,220 records per 100,000 residents. Rounding out the Top 5 were Delaware, California and Washington. The Bottom 5, in descending order, were Oklahoma, Louisiana, North Dakota, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The gun control group plans to issue an updated report in the coming weeks.

372,1382,Regulator grants license for Britain's first three-parent IVF babies.,"March 16, 2017",- Britain’s fertility regulator on Thursday granted doctors the first UK license to create babies using a three-parent IVF technique designed to prevent inherited genetic diseases.,Kate Kelland,"The license, granted to a team of doctors in Newcastle, northern England, means the first child created in Britain using the mitochondrial pronuclear transfer technique could be born before the end of this year. Critics of the treatment say it is a dangerous step that will lead to the creation of genetically modified “designer babies”. But the medical team at the Newcastle Fertility Centre said they were delighted with the decision “to help families affected by these devastating diseases”. “Many years of research have led to the development of pronuclear transfer as a treatment to reduce the risk of mothers transmitting disease to their children,” said Mary Herbert, a professor of Reproductive Biology at the Centre. “It’s a great testament to the regulatory system here in the UK that research innovation can be applied in treatment.”  The technique involves intervening in the fertilization process to remove mitochondria, which act as tiny energy-generating batteries inside cells, and which - if faulty - can cause fatal heart problems, liver failure, brain disorders, blindness and muscular dystrophy. The treatment is known as “three-parent” IVF because the babies, born from genetically modified embryos, would have DNA from a mother, a father and from a female donor. It is designed to help families with mitochondrial diseases - incurable conditions passed down the maternal line that affect around one in 6,500 children worldwide. Britain’s parliament voted last year to change the law to allow the treatments if and when they were ready for licensing. But the regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), still had to approve each clinic and each patient on an individual basis before the treatment can be carried out. Fertility specialists welcomed Thursday’s decision. Simon Fishel, managing director of CARE Fertility, said it was “excellent news” and “a milestone that all who care about medical health will welcome”. Allan Pacey, a fertility expert at Sheffield University, said it was “a great day for science”. While Britain has been at the forefront of scientific advances and ethical debate about pro-nuclear transfer techniques, it will not be the first country in the world to have children born using 3-parent IVF treatment. The world’s first and so-far only known mitochondrial transfer baby was born in 2016 after U.S. doctors working at a clinic in Mexico helped a Jordanian couple conceive using the treatment.

377,31928,A California Senate bill gives the state the right to seize children from their families,"December 12, 2016","Pan reported getting threats via email and by phone after the bill was signed, enough so that he required additional security. A recall petition against him needing 35,926 signatures later failed after not getting a single signature.",Arturo Garcia,"An “alternative health” website published a story on 9 December 2016, accusing a California lawmaker of facilitating government seizure of children through a new state Senate bill. The piece claims that state Sen. Richard Pan (D) placed families in danger when he introduced state Senate Bill 18 on 5 December 2016: This bill would declare the intent of the Legislature to expand and codify the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California to establish a comprehensive framework that governs the rights of all children and youth in California, outlines the research-based essential needs of California’s children, and establishes standards relating to the health, safety, well-being, early childhood and educational opportunities, and familial supports necessary for all children to succeed. The bill would declare the intent of the Legislature, by January 1, 2022, to enact legislation for the purpose of ensuring that the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state. While the story ran the proposal verbatim, it did not identify any specific language in the bill authorizing officials to remove children from their households. Instead it claimed — without sources — that “many across the state” are already ripping the bill. (It also heavily suggested that Pan was a “whipping boy” for the pharmaceutical industry.) The lawmaker, a pediatrician and faculty member at the University of California-Davis, has been targeted by opponents of mandatory school vaccination programs since co-authoring a different measure, Senate Bill 277, in February 2015. As his spokesperson, Shannan Martinez, said in a statement: This is a personal vendetta they have against Dr. Pan. They don’t want to understand the bill and instead choose to make up lies about the legislation and the Senator. The irony is that they oppose an effort to empower parents and ensure children and families get the support they need to succeed. The vaccination bill, which was filed in response to a measles outbreak at Disneyland in 2014, eliminated  “personal belief” exemptions for public and private school students across the state. It was enacted on 30 June 2015, meaning that students would be required to be vaccinated unless they were granted a medical exemption.",false,"Junk News, california, Richard Pan, SB-18"
384,29260,The seeds of certain common household plants can be used as an alternative to LSD.,"February 7, 2018",What's true: Many seeds belonging to a family of plants that includes Hawaiian baby woodrose and blue morning glory contain a chemical called LSA which can produce some psychoactive effects. What's false: LSA’s mechanism of action is biologically different than LSD and it comes with myriad other dangerous or unpleasant side effects that make it far from a viable alternative.,Alex Kasprak,"On 5 May 2016, a British tabloid ran a headline with an alarming concern: “Are FLOWER SEEDS the new party drug?” The question was the result of a local news story from Seekonk, Massachuchets, whose police department issued a warning about youths purchasing morning glory seeds from Home Depot as a substitute for LSD, and subsequently having a bad time: Over the past several weeks, students from a nearby school district were hospitalized as the result of ingesting the following plant seeds: Sleepy Grass, Hawaiian Baby Woodrose and Blue Morning Glory. Apparently, these seeds contain d-lysergic acid amide (LSA) which closely resembles LSD. Similarly, when ingested they can cause auditory and visual hallucinations, spatial and temporal distortion, introspection, and side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Recently, plant seeds were discovered in the Seekonk School District. […] We are fortunate indeed that there were no serious outcomes. Home Depot in Somerset has agreed to remove the seeds form [sic] the store shelves as they await a directive from the Corporate Headquarters. The headline misleadingly makes the practice sound like an epidemic, but Home Depot did confirm to us that they temporarily moved the seeds from their Seekonk store in response to a warning from the local police department, but that it was not a permanent move nor a move that affected any other stores. The Seekonk incident, however, highlights a common claim made of these seeds: that they contain a plausible chemical substitute to the hallucinogenic drug LSD called lysergic acid amide (LSA, also known as ergine). For example, The Anarchist’s Cookbook, a controversial counterculture publication from the 1970s, includes a recipe for “Making LSD in the Kitchen” which claims to extract “the lysergic acid amides either from morning glory seeds or Hawaiian woodrose seeds.” Indeed, the seeds of these and some other plants in the family Convolvulaceae (a broad classification of plants) do contain LSA. These plants, especially Hawaiian woodrose, have been used by numerous cultures as a traditional medicine and as an intoxicant for ceremonial practices. A 2014 paper investigating the psychoactive effects of the seeds of Hawaiian baby woodrose described the effects, which the authors attributed primarily to LSA: Sedation, an altered visual perception (e.g. of colors and textures), some kind of mood elevation, states of anxiety and changes in thought processes or sense of time. Vegetative side effects range from nausea, vertigo, hypertension, tachycardia [rapid heart rate], and tachypnea [rapid breathing] to mydriasis [pupil dilation]. While preliminary, that study attempted to uncover the neurologic mechanism behind LSA’s effects using chemical tests to predict which receptors in the brain the chemical targets, revealing that they likely occur through mechanisms that are biologically different the ones that cause LSD’s more famous psychedelic effects. Instead, LSA primarily promotes the less spiritually fulfilling and potentially more dangerous “vegetative side effects”: Although LSA from Argyreia nervosa [Hawaiian Baby Woodrose] is often considered as a natural kind of LSD, in our studies the pharmacological effects as well as the receptor binding profiles are quite different. Thus, LSA cannot be regarded as LSD-like psychedelic drug. Nevertheless the affinities at numerous biogenic amine receptor subtypes may be responsible for psychotic effects […], but the vegetative side effects are more dominant. In fact, a small-scale 2012 study which attempted to investigate the effects of LSA on human subjects had to be cancelled due to adverse side effects: A study was designed to assess how driving ability is affected by Argyreia nervosa [Hawaiian Baby Woodrose]. However, the study could not be continued due to severe adverse effects in 3 of 4 subjects, such as cardiovascular dysregulation in two and a psychosis like state in one subject. […] Furthermore, fluctuating alkaloid contents in seeds and multi-drug intoxications make the use of this legal high far more dangerous than commonly believed. While it is accurate to state that the LSA contained in some convolvulaceae seeds could potentially create (unpleasant) psychoactive effects, both the way the chemical produces those effects as well as the prevalence of separate dangerous physical side effects mean that it is far from an “alternative” for LSD.",false,"Medical, drugs, Hawaiian Baby Woodrose, legal highs"
386,32291,Photos and video clips narrated by a medical doctor demonstrate that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton likely has Parkinson's disease.,"September 9, 2016","In closing, we wish to make it clear what our aim has been in this analysis. We have not tried to make the case that Hillary Clinton does not have Parkinson’s disease (in point of fact, we don’t think that case even needs making). Rather, we have shown that what Ted Noel did in this video is systematically misrepresent perfectly ordinary and explicable phenomena as “Parkinson’s disease symptoms,” and his motivation for doing so was purely political.",David Emery,"Hillary Clinton’s health has been the subject of intense speculation during the 2016 presidential campaign, in part because the candidates’ fitness to serve is of valid concern to voters, and in part because it was seized upon by her opponents as a way to undermine her candidacy. While presidential candidates aren’t required by law to release information about their medical histories, it has become routine for them to do so, and both Democratic candidate Clinton and Republican candidate Trump have provided physician’s statements attesting to their good health. Despite this, rumors to the effect that Clinton is suffering from some kind of serious, undisclosed medical condition continue to run rampant. The statement released by Clinton’s personal doctor, Lisa Bardack, MD of Mount Kisco, New York, lists past bouts of deep vein thrombosis (blood clots), an elbow fracture, and a concussion, plus ongoing conditions of hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies. Though her family medical history includes heart disease and stroke, a cardiac screening was conducted in 2015 and came back negative. So did a cancer screening. “[Clinton] is in excellent physical condition,” Bardack concluded, “and fit to serve as President of the United States.” We note that Dr. Bardack’s assessment (which she reaffirmed in writing in August 2016) was based on an actual physical examination of the candidate — not a minor consideration, given that much of the speculation about Clinton’s health has been fueled by “diagnoses” from afar by physicians who have never shaken her hand, much less conducted a thorough examination of her. Media personality “Dr. Drew” Pinsky, for one, delivered a rambling assessment of Clinton’s health on a radio talk show in which he repeatedly claimed he had “grave concerns” about her medical fitness — based on nothing more than having read Dr. Bardack’s two-page statement. He was roundly criticized by other medical professionals for doing so. While Pinsky’s speculation was that Clinton suffers from brain damage, a later entrant in the armchair diagnosis field, Dr. Ted Noel of Orlando, Florida, claimed he could prove via cherry-picked news articles, photos, and video clips of the candidate that she likely suffers from Parkinson’s disease. Noel’s 16-minute video, titled “Hillary Clinton’s Illness Revealed,” starts with this disclaimer: I am a medical doctor with 36 years of experience, but I am not Hillary Clinton’s treating physician, so I can’t claim that what I’m about to tell you is a conclusive diagnosis. Nevertheless, at the end of a litany of hearsay, conjecture, and conspiracy theories Noel states, flat out: “Hillary Clinton has advanced Parkinson’s disease.” We’ll examine some of his evidence and arguments momentarily, but first, here’s what we know about Dr. Ted Noel himself:   That doesn’t mean he’s incapable of recognizing symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, but consider this: If your primary care doctor suspected you had Parkinson’s and wished to refer you to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis, it would be to a neurologist, not an anesthesiologist. How accurate and reliable can such a medical diagnosis be? As we noted in the case of Dr. Drew Pinsky above, most medical professionals consider this inappropriate behavior on the part of a physician, if not downright unethical. Would you accept a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease on the basis of a few minutes of video watched by a doctor you’ve never met? In fact, Noel’s assessment is nakedly partisan in intent, despite this feigned disavowal that he makes toward the end of the video: Let us not confuse medical and political issues here. I’m firmly opposed to Hillary Clinton on political and moral grounds, but this discussion has been about her medical condition. That’s after Noel has described Clinton as “a politician who lies about everything,” and after he has made this statement about her “medical” condition: Our president must always be strong and clear-headed. If she is not doing the job, then who will? Will it be Huma Abedin, who has been associated with Muslim causes and directly involved in the Clinton Foundation corruption? Will it be Bill Clinton, who is at the center of the Clinton Foundation corruption? … Or will Vice President Tim Kaine take over? Of course, then the Clintons would lose their juice. What is the above, if not precisely “confusing medical and political issues”? We’re not just throwing that out as a dismissive epithet; we mean he is a conspiracy theorist. The fundamental premise of this video is that Hillary Clinton and everyone around her — her doctor, her family and friends, the inner circle of her campaign, and the Democratic National Committee — know full well that she (supposedly) has an incapacitating disease and are willfully concealing that fact from the public to gain power. Let’s move on to consider the “evidence” Dr. Ted Noel uses to support his claim that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson’s disease. According to a conspiracy web site, an unnamed Secret Service whistleblower revealed that Clinton has Parkinson’s. Note well, however, Noel is here citing a secondhand report from a single, unnamed source published on the Alex Jones web site Infowars.com, which at one time or another has pushed every conspiracy theory known to humankind, from allegations that President George W. Bush authorized the 9/11 attacks (which, by the way, weren’t really “attacks” according to this site, but rather “controlled demolitions“) to the claim that President Barack Obama forged his own birth certificate. Noel says WikiLeaks released U.S. State Department e-mails which show that Clinton asked aides to research new Parkinson’s disease drugs. Not true. Among the messages WikiLeaks released was one e-mail received by Clinton that contained information about Provigil, a prescription drug described in that message as follows: Provigil is used to treat excessive sleepiness caused by narcolepsy or shift work sleep disorder (sleepiness during scheduled waking hours among people who work at night or on rotating shifts). It is also often prescribed to treat excessive sleepiness in patients with Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and multiple sclerosis. Additionally, it has also gained a following among students, truckers, and others who want to stay awake for extended periods of time. In simpler terms, Provigil is used to treat excessive sleepiness. Sometimes that excessive sleepiness is in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s patients. Other times it’s in people suffering from sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or shift work sleep disorder. Is it accurate to describe Provigil as “a new Parkinson’s disease drug”? No. Are there Wikileaks e-mails indicating that Clinton specifically asked staffers to research Parkinson’s drugs? No (check for yourself). Noel attempts to link three separate incidents over a period of years in which Clinton fainted and/or fell, implying that the stated explanations for each hid the “real” cause, Parkinson’s disease. 31 January 2005: Clinton said she was feeling “queasy” as she began a speech in upstate New York and later fainted at the podium. Secret Service agents broke her fall, so she was unhurt. “Oddly, she did not seek medical attention,” Noel claims, but, even more oddly, an image of a CNN article reporting that she did receive medical attention at scene from a doctor in the audience flashes on screen at the exact moment he says it. The physician, Dr. Stephanie Pincus, said Clinton had been suffering from a GI virus for at least a day, and needed fluids and a rest. Nothing mysterious. 17 June 2009: Clinton fell and broke her elbow on her way from the elevator to her car in the basement of the State Department. Noel again uses the word “odd” to describe the incident, wondering why Secret Service agents weren’t able to break her fall, as they had done in the previous incident. “She would have to fall at a distance from them with no warning,” he opines. And, indeed, according to news reports, she slipped and fell — obviously without warning. Nothing mysterious. 17 December 2012: Clinton fainted in her home due to dehydration and struck her head, causing a concussion. “But again, this is very odd,” Noel says. “To strike your head requires a complete loss of protective reflexes.” Which, not very oddly at all, is precisely what occurs when you faint and lose consciousness. “Being wobbly from dehydration won’t do this,” he argues. But no one is talking about “being wobbly.” Clinton fainted; she lost consciousness, fell, and hit her head. And dehydration is frequently cited as a cause of fainting. Nothing mysterious. Why does Noel try so hard to make it seem there was something inexplicable about each of these incidents? Here’s why: “If Hillary has Parkinson’s disease,” Noel says, “all three falls make sense” — as if they’re impossible to make sense of without the Parkinson’s explanation. But, as we’ve just shown, that is not the case. “Early in 2016,” Noel continues, “Hillary’s problems started to be really obvious. Videos of odd physical movements and brain freezes became common. This is consistent with the progression of Parkinson’s disease into its later and more troublesome stages. “The first picture to surface is Hillary being helped up a set of porch steps in February. Once again, if she froze while climbing the steps, the people right next to her could catch her and keep her from injury.”  But there’s no reason to suppose that she “froze.” The original caption on this Getty Images photo, dated 24 February 2016, says she slipped while going up the stairs. Noel then directs our attention to a video clip in which Clinton is seen nodding repetitively as other people speak:  “To most people, that was just odd,” says Noel, once again employing his favorite adjective. “But if we think about Parkinson’s disease, it’s obvious. This is a head nodding tremor.” No, it isn’t. It’s a tic Hillary Clinton has had for a long time, since at least the early ’90s, usually in evidence when she’s listening to another public speaker. Here’s an example from 1993:    Noel next shows a video of a Clinton campaign rally on 2 April 2016, in which he claims she uses certain “techniques to hide tremors in her hands.” The first is placing her hand flat on her chest, and the second is a gesture in which her fingers come together to form a sort of point — both of which he claims she does to prevent the audience from noticing tremors. But, in fact, if you watch more of the video than the few seconds Noel shows us, and with the audio turned on, you see that she’s clearly using these gestures to emphasize verbal statements, and to suggest to the audience that they’re heartfelt. Plus, she transitions easily in and out of these hand gestures, never once displaying anything like a “tremor” when she’s not using them. Noel next presents a series of images and clips, including every conspiracy theorist’s favorite Hillary Clinton video — the same one that they have previously tried to pass off as an “epileptic seizure” — and claims, again, that the real explanation is Parkinson’s. Here’s the famous video:  This is “another Parkinson’s disease problem,” Noel claims, “but this time it’s from the treatment, not the disease. It’s an example of Parkinson’s disease levadopa-induced dyskinesia, or PD LID.” But no, it’s not. As we reported previously, the journalists surrounding her at that moment saw nothing amiss or disturbing in her actions. Associated Press reporter Lisa Lerer described it as follows: As an Associated Press reporter who’s spent more than a year covering her candidacy, I was there for her appearance. After she ordered herself a “cold chai,” my colleagues and I shouted some questions, mostly about Clinton’s recent meeting with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Perhaps eager to avoid answering or maybe just taken aback by our volume, Clinton responded with an exaggerated motion, shaking her head vigorously for a few seconds. Video of the moment shows me holding out my recorder in front of her, laughing and stepping back in surprise. After the exchange, she took a few more photos, exited the shop and greeted supporters waiting outside.",false,"Politics Conspiracy Theories, 2016 presidential campaign, hillary clinton, infowars"

","July 12, 2019","While an instance of hair-grooming syncope may certainly be scary for those involved (especially if it involves a seizure), the biggest difference between this condition and other bouts of fainting is that hair-grooming syncope is specifically triggered by the brushing, combing, curling, or cutting of hair, as pediatrician Dr. Kurt Brandt observed: “Syncope is basically passing out, and hair grooming is known to be a precipitant of that … It may be the pulling of the hair, possibly pain, possibly stimulation of the scalp … Your blood pressure goes down and you pass out.”",Dan Evon,"On July 7, 2019, Facebook user Alicia Brown Phillips brought attention to a fainting disorder known as “hair-grooming syncope” when she shared a message concerning a scary ordeal that reportedly occurred while she was attempting to curl her little sister’s hair: I experienced one of the scariest moments of my life this morning with my little sister and I am going to put this out there because I had never heard of this in my life! Hair-grooming Syncope … Look it up. This morning I was curling my little sister Gracie’s hair for church. I was maybe about five minutes in and she starts to gag a little and looks kind of pale. I asked her if she was going to get sick and she shook her head yes. I get my little daughters out of the bathroom and start to hold her hair up for her as she leans over the toilet. 30 seconds later… she looks at me. She is extremely pale with blue lips and starts to pass out. Her pupils got really big and I caught her. I start screaming for Dale to come help. Gracie has a blank stare and look on her face and is completely unresponsive and limp for about a minute. Her hands were also shaking. Very seizure like. She then comes back to and says she feels much better. She says she remembers hearing us talk but couldn’t see us. I was crying. She was very confused. My mom and dad rush to my house and a few hours in Children’s hospital, an EKG, and a head scan later… she is fine. Turns out there is something called hair-grooming syncope affects kids from ages 5-13. They said they see about 1-5 cases a year. Turns out brushing, curling, braiding, or drying can cause nerve stimulation on the scalp and cause some children to have seizure like symptoms. I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE! We were told if she ever starts to feel nauseous or light headed while getting her hair brushed to sit down and take a break. I am putting this out there for others to see. If a kid ever complains of their belly hurting or feeling light headed while they are getting their hair done, make sure they take a seat and keep a close eye on them! Apparently very rare but so scary to see it happen! This Facebook post garnered ten of thousands of shares and comments within a few days of its initial posting. In addition to expressing concern for the child’s health, many commentators, like Phillips herself, were surprised to learn about this condition. “Syncope” is the medical term for fainting. “Hair-grooming syncope” refers to fainting that is brought on during hair grooming activities. A 1996 study defined the condition as follows: “Hair-grooming syncope is a rare and benign variety of neurocardiogenic syncope that should be considered in girls that complain of loss of consciousness during different hair care acts, even if seizures are present.” A 2009 study found that while this condition occurs most frequently in females, male children can also experience hair-grooming syncope: “Of the 111 patients, 78% were girls. We found characteristic difference between boys and girls with boys experiencing syncope more during hair cutting whereas girls experienced syncope more during hair combing and brushing.” We weren’t able to find any concrete numbers regarding how often hair-grooming syncope occurs. Knoxville’s WBIR reported that doctors see a “handful” of cases a year, but it’s possible this condition often goes undiagnosed because most parents aren’t aware that the condition exists, or it may be misdiagnosed as epilepsy:",true,Medical

Biden has used the word “xenophobic” several times in reference to Trump and his actions, but never directly in reference to the ban Trump placed on travel from China.",Bill McCarthy,"President Donald Trump repeated the misleading claim that former Vice President Joe Biden called him xenophobic for banning travel from China in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Trump added a new wrinkle on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, claiming that Biden not only called the travel restrictions xenophobic, but also apologized for the remark ""with a letter on a Friday night."" ""Biden has now written a letter of apology because I did the right thing,"" Trump said during a May 3 virtual town hall with Fox News. ""He actually apologized with a letter on a Friday night saying ‘he made the right move,'"" Trump said later. ""It wasn’t well played by the press, but he said I made the right move."" There may be a simple reason why the letter Trump described didn’t get media coverage: There is no evidence such a letter exists. ""Never happened,"" said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates. Neither the Trump campaign nor the White House responded to our requests for comment in time for publication, and Trump wasn’t asked to substantiate his claim during the town hall. We found no public record of any Friday-night letter of apology — or any letter of apology — from Biden on Twitter, Google or the Nexis news archive database. Other political reporters and fact-checkers have reached the same conclusion. On Jan. 31, the Trump administration announced temporary restrictions on travel into the U.S. for immigrants and non-immigrants who had recently been ""physically present"" in China, with exceptions made for U.S. citizens and permanent residents and their family members. The move followed similar decisions from roughly 45 other countries and announcements from a number of airlines that they would be suspending flights between China and the U.S. while the outbreak ran its course. Trump has repeatedly touted the policy, crediting it with saving ""hundreds of thousands of lives"" during the Fox News town hall. Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, declared Biden’s support for the China restrictions months later in a statement to CNN on April 3, a Friday. CNN posted its story in the afternoon. ""Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,"" Bedingfeld told CNN. ""Science supported this ban, therefore he did too."" But Biden never explicitly called the travel restrictions xenophobic, as Trump has claimed. At a campaign event on Jan. 31, the same day Trump announced the China travel restrictions, Biden cited Trump’s ""xenophobia"" but did not specifically mention the administration’s policy. He said that in a time of ""crisis with the coronavirus,"" the ""credibility of a president is most needed."" ""This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science,"" he said. The following day, Biden tweeted, ""We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering."" We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency. Biden used the word twice more in March. But one comment was in reference to Trump calling the coronavirus a ""foreign"" virus, and the second was not clearly in reference to the travel policy. Bates, Biden’s spokesman, told us in March that Biden ""has decried Trump's xenophobia for years, and was saying that it shouldn't influence the U.S. approach to this outbreak."" ""This was not in reference to coronavirus travel restrictions,"" he said. An April ad from the Trump campaign selectively edited a clip of Biden to make it seem like the former vice president admitted to complimenting Trump for the China travel restrictions.

Trump said Biden called the ban on travel coming in from China ""xenophobic,"" and that ""he actually apologized with a letter on a Friday night saying ‘he made the right move.’"" We found no record of any letter or apology from Biden.

394,35539,"By spring 2020, the sun had entered a ""lockdown"" period where its solar activity decreased to the point that famine, earthquakes, and freezing weather threatened life on Earth.","May 20, 2020","What's true: Solar activity, which is often defined by the amount of sunspots on the star's surface, pendulates on a roughly 11-year cycle. The most recent cycle, which began in late 2008, peaked with sunspots in April 2014 and then steadily decreased until reaching a ""solar minimum"" — or a period with zero sunspots — in late 2019 and 2020. That means, yes, by spring 2020, solar activity had reached a so-called ""lockdown,"" or solar minimum. What's false: While the sun had entered a so-called ""lockdown"" period — when the number of sunspots on the star's surface decreased to few or none, technically called a ""solar minimum"" — by spring 2020, it was a normal occurrence for the star and was not projected by scientists to threaten life on Earth with famine, earthquakes, or freezing weather.",Jessica Lee,"In mid-May 2020, as people worldwide remained quarantined to limit the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, social media posts claimed not only were humans on Earth sheltering-in-place during the pandemic, but our life source — the sun — had gone on “lockdown,” too. Recirculating sensational headlines on the concept — including the New York Post’s May 14 article “The sun has entered a ‘lockdown’ period, which could cause freezing weather, famine“ — numerous people reached out to Snopes to investigate the validity of the claim: that the power of our solar system’s star had decreased to the point that life on Earth would be threatened by famine, earthquakes, and freezing temperatures. First, we considered the definitions of key terms in helioseismology (the study of the sun) to make sense of the claim. Per astronomers’ research over centuries, the sun generates powerful magnetic forces that are constantly changing, affecting the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and X-rays from the ball of gas that illuminates Earth. In areas of the star where the magnetic fields are particularly strong — thus restricting some heat from the sun’s core from reaching its surface — dark spots appear, or what astronomers call sunspots. In other words, sunspots are places on the sun that are cooler than other areas. Sarah Scoles, a writer for the peer-reviewed Science Magazine, of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, wrote in 2019: Sunspots can be seen with the naked eye, but it wasn’t until the mid-1800s that astronomers realized they come and go on a rough schedule. They first appear at midlatitudes and then proliferate, migrating toward the equator over about 11 years. In contrast, flashes of light on the star’s surface occur when magnetic fields tangle or cross each other, causing a sudden explosion of energy — a phenomenon astronomers call solar flares. All of these factors — the number of sunspots, their locations, and the intensity of solar flares, etc. — are known as solar activity, which, like Scoles pointed out, fluctuates on a relatively predictable cycle every 11 years or so. Astronomers measure this 11-year timeframe, the sun cycle, in two major phases: when sunspots gradually increase over roughly five or six years, peaking for a solar maximum, and when sunspots diminish over the next approximately five or six years until there are few or zero sunspots, called a solar minimum. NASA writes: While intense activity such as sunspots and solar flares subside during solar minimum, that doesn’t mean the sun becomes dull. Solar activity simply changes form. In late 2008, the sun began its 24th solar cycle since scientists began taking accurate measurements of solar activity. The cycle’s solar maximum, or when the sun was at its most active state with its highest level of sunspots, occurred in April 2014, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). And from that point on, the number of sunspots decreased until late 2019, when the sun had zero sunspots, or reached a solar minimum. As of May 2020, the sun remained at a solar minimum, which meant one facet of the claim — that the sun had entered a so-called “lockdown” period, or solar minimum, by spring 2020 — was true. Dr. Tony Phillips, a former NASA researcher who now runs a daily website with astronomy updates for scientists, said in a May 19, 2020, email to Snopes that scientists expected the latest phase to last through much, if not all, of 2020. For solar scientists like him, the phases in the sun cycle are important because they can change how satellites or natural debris orbit the Earth; different periods can also intensify cosmic rays and slightly dim the brightness of the sun’s rays. With little or zero sunspots on the star’s surface, there’s greater likelihood of long-lived coronal holes, which are low-energy regions in the outermost part of the sun’s atmosphere where magnetic forces open up and allow streams of solar particles to escape the star — and those flows of solar wind can cause space weather effects if, or when, they hit Earth’s magnetic field, according to NASA. In a 2017 article about the upcoming solar minimum in 2019 and 2020, NASA said: These effects (from long-lived coronal holes) can include temporary disturbances of the Earth’s magnetosphere, called geomagnetic storms, auroras, and disruptions to communications and navigation systems. During solar minimum, the effects of Earth’s upper atmosphere on satellites in low Earth orbit changes too. Furthermore, in other periods of the solar cycle, the star’s ultraviolet radiation heats up the Earth’s atmosphere in a way that causes friction for anything hovering and orbiting the globe. That friction causes what scientists call “drag,” a phenomenon that prevents natural and manmade space debris from reaching low-orbiting rings closest to the Earth’s surface. But during a solar minimum, the NASA article stated, “this natural heating mechanism subsides,” adding: Earth’s upper atmosphere cools and, to some degree, can collapse. Without a normal amount of drag, space junk tends to hang around. That means it is accurate to say solar minimums can affect space weather, though the impacts remain at the atmospheric level. Next, to fully investigate the claim, we looked for any indication from scientists that the latest solar minimum — or the 25th sun cycle — was forecasted to affect humans in ways that most cycles in modern history had not: by causing low-crop production, earthquakes, and freezing weather. According to a panel of scientists sponsored by NOAA and NASA that makes such projections, as of April 2019, the upcoming roughly 11-year sun cycle (the 25th) was expected to “likely be weak” compared to others in modern history, yet similar to the previous cycle (the 24th) in terms of its number of sunspots and how they pendulate over time. NASA released the following graphic to help people visualize the prediction:  That means, as of this writing, astronomers were not predicting any catastrophic damages as a result of the 2019-2020 solar minimum. Phillips said: This is a normal part of the solar cycle. … Although this Solar Minimum is unusually deep compared to other Minima of the Space Age (1957 to present), it is hardly unprecedented. The Solar Minimum of 2008-2009 was similarly deep and, by the way, caused *no* famines, earthquakes or other catastrophes. If Solar Minimum went on forever — that is, if the sun got “stuck” and never produced any more sunspots — then, yes, new types of effects might emerge. Since the start of astronomers’ research into the sun’s patterns, it has always produced sunspots after a solar minimum, even after the 17th Century’s Maunder Minimum, or “prolonged sunspot minimum,” from 1645 to 1715, when sunspots were exceedingly rare for about 70 years. “However, there is no evidence that the sun is currently ‘stuck’,” Phillips said of the 2020 claim. “On the contrary, we are already starting to see the first sunspots of the next solar cycle. By the end of this year, we will probably be on the up-swing again.” Lastly, to complete our examination, we looked at where the concerns about the sun had originated; the New York Post’s article was a recycled report by the British tabloid newspaper, The Sun, which appeared to have been the first publication to dub what is a normal occurrence in the sun’s 11-year cycle a “lockdown” without any specific attribution. The tabloid stated declaratively in the report’s first paragraph:",false,Science

What's false: Assange's pleas long antedate the 2016 election and are unrelated to its outcome.",Kim LaCapria,"On 16 November 2016 the web site Winning Democrats published an article implying that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was seeking a personal presidential pardon from Donald Trump as recompense for “[s]abotaging Clinton]”: Julian Assange Finally Asks Trump for Payment for Sabotaging Clinton — A Full Pardon With the 2016 elections over and Trump as the President-elect, Julian Assange is finally asking for payment for his part in assisting the Trump campaign. Since 2011, Assange has been avoiding prosecution in the United States for leaking documents through his organization, Wikileaks, relating to foreign affairs with information that had been given “secret” classification by the U.S. government … In light of his anti-Clinton sentiment and despite the fact that he once likened Trump to cholera, Assange is now appealing to Trump to pardon him — the fact that he is currently under investigation and hasn’t actually been convicted of anything notwithstanding. With a history of anti-semitism and misogyny behind him, Julian Assange would fit in well with the company Trump currently surrounds himself, including alt-right advocate Steve Bannon and of course, Trump himself. As Breitbart correctly noted, WikiLeaks has already been negotiating with American authorities for several years with respect to the organization’s operations. On 19 August 2012, Assange issued a formal statement from the Ecuadorean Embassy in which he implored President Obama that: As WikiLeaks stands under threat, so does the freedom of expression and the health of our societies. We must use this moment to articulate the choice that is before the government of the United States of America. Will it return to and reaffirm the values it was founded on? Or will it lurch off the precipice dragging us all into a dangerous and oppressive world in which journalists fall silent under the fear of prosecution and citizens must whisper in the dark? I say that it must turn back. I ask President Obama to do the right thing. The United States must renounce its witch-hunt against WikiLeaks. The United States must dissolve its FBI investigation. The United States must vow that it will not seek to prosecute our staff or our supporters. The United States must pledge before the world that it will not pursue journalists for shining a light on the secret crimes of the powerful. There must be no more foolish talk about prosecuting any media organization, be it WikiLeaks or the New York Times. The US administration’s war on whistle-blowers must end. Thomas Drake, William Binney, John Kirakou and the other heroic US whistle-blowers must – they must – be pardoned and compensated for the hardships they have endured as servants of the public record. And the Army Private who remains in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth Kansas, who was found by the UN to have endured months of torturous detention in Quantico Virginia and who has yet — after two years in prison — to see a trial, must be released. (Assange currently resides at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London after seeking asylum from that country and is wanted by Swedish authorities over allegations of sexual assault, so he would not necessarily escape legal troubles personally if he were pardoned by the U.S. president.) In November 2010, the Program in Law and Journalism at New York Law School blog Legal As She Is Spoke argued WikiLeaks (and by extension, Assange) had “committed no crime” for publishing leaked documents pertaining to the U.S. conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The piece stood in stark relief to items published in 2016 decrying WikiLeaks for its activity: Since August, when Wikileaks first published 91,000 classified documents relating to the Afghanistan War, and in October, when they published approximately 400,000 more relating to the War in Iraq, many conservative commentators have been clamoring for the Justice Department to prosecute Wikileaks for publishing classified information. But in the United States, generally publishing classified information is not a crime. The sort of information that a news organization can be prosecuted for publishing is limited to: nuclear secrets (Atomic Energy Act), the identities of covert agents (Intelligence Identities Protection Act), and certain forms of communications intelligence (Section 798 of the Espionage Act). Perhaps lamenting that the U.S. does not have an Official Secrets Act like the United Kingdom, right wing columnists have consistently misinterpreted these Acts, or have cited other provisions of our espionage laws which almost surely do not apply to Wikileaks. The most commonly cited statute by those who advocate prosecuting Wikileaks is Section 793(e) of the Espionage Act. In August, former Bush speechwriter Marc Theissen linked to this section in an article for the Washington Post when he wrote that Wikileaks is “a criminal enterprise” whose founder, Julian Assange, should be arrested by U.S. forces on foreign soil, international law be damned. But this provision does not apply to those who publish information. Section 793(e)reads “Whoever having unauthorized possession of, access to, or control over any document…relating to the national defense…willfully communicates… the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it…[s]hall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.” As made clear in the Pentagon Papers case, the word “communicates” was never meant “to encompass publication” or to affect the press. Congress included the word “publish” in three other sections of the Act but intentionally left it out of 793. As the legislative history of this provision states, “Nothing in this Act shall … in any way to limit or infringe upon freedom of the press or of speech as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.” Slate published an editorial titled “Why I Love WikiLeaks” on 30 November 2010 that lauded the site for “shock[ing] us out of [] complacency,” again with a tenor absent from coverage of the platform during the 2016 election: As Assange navigates from military and diplomatic exposés to financial ones this year, his Wall Street targets won’t be able to shield their incompetence and misconduct with lip music about how he has damaged national security and violated the Espionage Act of 1917 and deserves capital punishment. But I’m sure they’ll invoke trade secrets, copyright, privacy, or whatever other legal window dressing they find convenient. Rather than defending their behavior, they’ll imitate Clinton and assail Assange’s methods and practices. As the Economist put it, “secrecy is necessary for national security and effective diplomacy.” But it “is also inevitable that the prerogative of secrecy will be used to hide the misdeeds of the permanent state and its privileged agents.” Assange and WikiLeaks, while not perfect, have punctured the prerogative of secrecy with their recent revelations. The untold story is that while doing the United States’ allies, adversaries, and enemies a favor with his leaks, he’s doing the United States the biggest favor by holding it accountable. As I.F. Stone put it, “All governments lie, but disaster lies in wait for countries whose officials smoke the same hashish they give out.” We contacted WikiLeaks’ Task Force, a subset of the organization dedicated to ensuring accuracy in reporting about the platform’s activities. A volunteer with whom we spoke confirmed that WikiLeaks had beseeched the Obama administration for many years to cease investigating their activities and to pardon whistleblowers, adding that the organization “publishes without [favor]” and would never release or withhold information based upon the possibility of favorable treatment from any state or entity.",false,"Uncategorized, joe. my. god, julian assange, president obama"

He got his numbers right, but it’s worth noting that no governor is solely, or even mostly, responsible for economic growth in their state -- and if he wants to take credit for the expansion on his watch, then he also needs to shoulder some of the blame for the bust that followed his departure from office. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",Amy Sherman,"At an event in Orlando attended by several GOP presidential contenders, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a likely Republican candidate, touted his state’s record on job creation during his tenure. ""In Florida, during my eight years, we grew at 4.4 percent per year, and we created, together, many of the people in this room, by creating a better environment, we created 1.3 million net new jobs -- more jobs created than Texas, more jobs created than any state in country other than California, a state 2 1/2 times our size,"" Bush said. That’s a direct knock at one of his likely rivals in the presidential race -- former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who also spoke at the summit and is expected to announce his candidacy for president later this week. We decided to look at the number of jobs created in Florida and Texas, respectively, and how much credit Bush deserves for that. Bush was governor from January 1999 through January 2007; Perry was governor from late 2000 to early 2015. Net jobs in Florida vs. Texas Bush’s term in office was bookended by two periods of robust job growth -- 1998-2000 and 2004-06. The 2007 recession hit after he left office. Bush’s spokesman pointed to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for total, nonfarm, seasonally adjusted jobs. In Florida, there were about 6.7 million such jobs in December 1998 and 8 million in December 2006. That works out to about 1.3 million net new jobs. By comparison, in Texas, there were about 9.1 million jobs in December 1998 and 10.2 million jobs in December 2006. That works out to 1.1 million net new jobs. So during Bush’s two terms in office -- which, we’ll note, includes a period before Perry was governor -- the number of net new jobs in Florida was 186,800 higher than in Texas. Does Bush get credit for the job growth? Bush took a measure of credit during his speech. And on his PAC’s website, Bush also took credit for growth saying that ""his limited-government approach helped unleash one of the most robust and dynamic economies in the nation, creating 1.3 million net new jobs ... ."" Is that justified? We started by asking his spokesman if he could point to anything that Bush did to fuel that job growth. ""Creating 1.3 million new jobs and leading the nation in job creation over your final five years in office doesn’t just happen by riding an economic wave,"" Matt Gorman said. ""That takes strong, pro-growth economic policies like those put in place by Gov. Bush. He consistently improved Florida's business climate, including cutting taxes every year he was in office."" PolitiFact has frequently noted that when it comes to the economy and jobs, assigning credit (or blame) for a given statistical accomplishment isn’t as clear cut as politicians would like voters to believe. Much has to do with timing: Bush was fortunate to have governed during some economically robust years. ""It is very hard to measure how much credit Gov. Bush should get for the job creation in Florida during his eight years, since so many different factors affect a state's job creation,"" George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair said. Sean Snaith, the director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness, compared the state’s economy to an omelet with many ingredients going into the final product. Snaith said it’s ""difficult to point to one specific ingredient as being responsible for the omelet itself. Florida’s economy performed very well during this time period, the economic omelet was quite tasty. Not all of the ingredients, however, originated in Tallahassee’s kitchen. Low interest rates and a global thirst for oil impacted these state’s economies but neither had any control of these important ingredients."" Moody’s economist Kwame Donaldson added that in the early 2000s, Nevada and Arizona  experienced a similar growth trajectory as Florida, suggesting that Bush’s policies were not singularly responsible for his state’s growth. (Arizona, for instance, had a Democratic governor for the second half of the period in question.) Construction fueled Florida’s job growth -- and then bust The experts added that it’s worth looking at what happened after Bush left office. Texas’ job growth during that time frame was also relatively strong – a 19.6 percent increase in Florida vs. a 12.5 percent increase in Texas. Both states were higher than the 7.6 percent for the country as a whole over that period, said David Cooper, an expert on state labor markets at the Economic Policy Institute. Construction employment in Florida grew by 46.6 percent over that time frame -- more than double the growth in Texas and the nation. Then, when the recession hit, the construction job market in Florida nosedived. As a result, ""Florida’s job losses were much more severe than in Texas,"" Cooper said. ""I am not sure that the job growth during Jeb Bush administration should be celebrated, because it was primarily fueled by a housing bubble that burst as Bush’s term was ending,"" said Donaldson of Moody’s. ""Florida is still struggling to recover from this housing bust."" Sinclair concurred. ""Although it makes more sense for a governor to compare across states in order to somewhat control for national level events, it would also be fair for him to take some of the blame for the worse performance of Florida so soon after he left office if he wants to take credit for the good times,"" she said. Texas, by contrast, was not as hard hit because it had stronger bank regulation, meaning it didn’t have as many bad loans as Florida, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. As The Economist explained in 2010, ""Texas has strict rules on home-equity lending, relative to other states, and this has helped to prevent ratios of loan size to home value from rising as high as they have elsewhere."" Residential construction fell by about two thirds in Texas, but it collapsed by even more -- 85 percent -- in Florida, said Moody’s senior economist Chris Lafakis. ""I certainly wouldn’t blame only Gov. Bush for Florida’s recession — there were many culpable parties that overlooked and underestimated the effect of horrific lending standards and bad mortgages — but Gov. Bush certainly didn’t prevent or mitigate the recession either,"" he said. ""Vermont is an example where state policy restricted the housing boom but prevented the housing bust."" It’s also worth noting that the sheer number of new jobs doesn’t say much about how well they paid, said Harry Holzer, a Georgetown University economist who is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""Texas and Florida are both places that get a big influx of migrants either from other states or immigrants from other countries and I think they drive a lot of job creation in both places, often low-wage job creation,"" Holzer said. Our ruling Bush said that during his eight years in office, ""we created 1.3 million net new jobs, more jobs created than Texas."" He got his numbers right, but it’s worth noting that no governor is solely, or even mostly, responsible for economic growth in their state -- and if he wants to take credit for the expansion on his watch, then he also needs to shoulder some of the blame for the bust that followed his departure from office.

But saying that ""between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies"" are aborted goes beyond the limits of the data. Federal data doesn’t account for all 50 states, and fails to factor in pregnancies that end in a miscarriage. Private data is based on surveys and is years out of date.",Anthony Cave,"U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., has been active in the nation’s capital recently, lobbying for legislation he introduced that would ban abortions based on race or gender. Critics say the proposed ban is ""stereotyping,"" as women seek abortions for a multitude of reasons, such as financial constraints. Franks presented a series of abortion statistics at an April 14 House subcommittee hearing on the legislation, called the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, or PRENDA. ""Today in America, between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies, virtually 1-in-2 are killed before they are born, which is a greater cause of death for African-Americans than heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS and violence combined,"" Franks said. The congressman’s matter-of-fact claim intrigued us, so we decided to check it out. Limited data Franks’ spokeswoman, Destiny Edwards, referenced multiple reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, for his claim. Because Franks is talking specifically about abortion, we did not account for babies who may die as a result of domestic violence, for example, before birth. Guttmacher notes that African-American women accounted for an estimated 37 percent of the 1.21 million total abortions performed in 2008. That would in theory translate to 447,700 abortions. That same year, according to the CDC, 670,809 African-American babies were born. But Guttmacher’s abortion data is based on surveys with women and abortion providers. It is not a complete picture. Plus, total abortions dropped to about 1.06 million in 2011, but Guttmacher doesn’t have updated demographic breakdowns, Guttmacher Institute spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said. The CDC’s data is similarly imperfect. As we’ve noted in a previous abortion claim from PolitiFact Florida, the CDC does not have a complete record of abortions. Most states require hospitals, facilities and physicians to report all abortions to a central health agency. But not every state reports this abortion data to the feds -- and they’re not required to either. The data also leaves out more than 20 states, including Arizona, California and Florida. According to the CDC’s 2012 data, the most recent available, the abortion ratio for non-Hispanic African-American women was 435 abortions per 1,000 African-American live births. But Nikki Mayes, a CDC spokeswoman, said that interpreting the ratio as a percent wouldn't be fair. Live births exclude stillbirths and miscarriages. According to the Mayo Clinic, 10 to 20 percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. The second half of Franks’ claim, comparing other causes of death, is even more complicated. CDC data is split among leading causes of death between African-American men and women. For African-American men, the leading causes of death are heart disease (24.1 percent), cancer (23.3 percent) and accidents (5.5 percent). Diabetes accounts for 3.9 percent of deaths and HIV, not AIDS, makes up 2.1 percent. For African-American women, it's heart disease (24.1 percent), cancer (22.6 percent) and stroke (6.4 percent). Diabetes among African-American women account for 4.6 percent of deaths, while accidents make up 2.8 percent of deaths. Our ruling Franks said, ""Today in America, between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies, virtually 1-in-2 are killed before they are born.""

400,2021,Raw milk debate simmers as states and FDA mull rules.,"February 23, 2011","Clifford Hatch cares for about 20 cows at his family-run farm, producing fresh raw milk that is at the center of controversy over its sale and safety.",Zach Howard,"A bottle of milk in a refrigerator bears a label showing that it is from cows not treated with artificial growth hormones, in Washington in this November 9, 2009 file photo. REUTERS/Jim Bourg Hatch sells raw, or unpasteurized, milk products from a retail shop at his dairy farm, which state regulations allow him to do because the business is located on the same property where his Ayrshire cattle are milked. He said he might sell 40 to 50 gallons a day at his Upinngill Farm, which started producing raw milk and cheese years ago when local residents began seeking an alternative to dairy from big, industrialized producers whose use of artificial bovine growth hormones was widespread then. “The system is pretty sensible and reasonably well-enforced,” Hatch said. But debate is swirling over raw milk in many U.S. states, and the thought of tighter federal rules on its production and sale makes independent producers such as Hatch uneasy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both strongly warn the public against drinking raw milk. They see potential health risks from pathogens like E. coli bacteria, which in some instances can get into milk from an animal’s manure. But raw dairy advocates say unpasteurized milk is at least as safe as the “superheated” varieties because of the dedication small-batch farmers have to maintaining hygienic facilities. Some people prefer raw milk, saying it is sweeter and has more vitamins and minerals, “healthy” bacteria and digestive enzymes. They say pasteurizing milk, or heating it to above 160 degrees Fahrenheit, destroys most of those features. Part of the debate centers on cheese, which is legal under federal law if it is aged at least 60 days to kill bacteria such as E. coli. But the FDA is mulling extending the aging requirement past 60 days which could, in effect, outlaw some popular raw milk cheeses as well as pasteurized ripened cheeses. An FDA spokeswoman said on Wednesday the agency is looking at whether the aging requirements for cheese “are sufficient to minimize pathogens,” including salmonella and E. coli. The FDA’s review could take until late in the year, when it would release results of its risk study, she said. Some raw dairy proponents fear the FDA could outlaw raw milk production altogether. “Their policy certainly is very anti-raw milk. It’s always a concern,” said Winton Pitcoff, raw milk network coordinator for the Massachusetts chapter of the Northeast Organic Farming Association (NOFAMass). Some U.S. states are restricting raw milk use already. Vermont has both deep agricultural roots and a newer local-food renaissance boosting the economy. But the state this month suspended workshops led by an advocacy group teaching people how to turn unpasteurized milk into butter and cheese. Vermont’s agriculture agency says the state’s 2009 raw milk law limits farmers to selling it to customers for fluid consumption only. But the agency says it will not interfere with how people use or consume raw milk in their own homes. In ten states, including California, Maine, Connecticut and New Hampshire, people can buy raw milk in grocery stores. But sales are banned in many other states, including dairy giant Wisconsin. Federal law also bans interstate sales of raw milk. A few states are considering legalization or loosening regulations, among them Texas, New Jersey and Massachusetts. Massachusetts does not allow raw milk sales in grocery stores, but it is considering a bill to let farmers deliver to customers and sell at stands away from their farms. Raw milk producers can sell a gallon of fresh milk for $6 to $12 — about four times what processors pay dairy farmers for milk they truck to processing plants. Farmers say the heftier price can make the difference between a farm being profitable or needing to shut down. The number of dairy farms nationwide has dwindled. In Massachusetts, about 5,000 farms existed in 1950 but today fewer than 180 remain, NOFAMass says.",true,Environment
402,8014,Cuban doctors head to Italy to battle coronavirus.,"March 22, 2020",Communist-run Cuba said it dispatched a brigade of doctors and nurses to Italy for the first time this weekend to help in the fight against the novel coronavirus at the request of the worst-affected region Lombardy.,Nelson Acosta,"The Caribbean island has sent its “armies of white robes” to disaster sites around the world largely in poor countries since its 1959 revolution. Its doctors were in the front lines in the fight against cholera in Haiti and against ebola in West Africa in the 2010s. Yet with the 52-strong brigade, this is the first time Cuba has sent an emergency contingent to Italy, one of the world’s richest countries, demonstrating the reach of its medical diplomacy. This is the sixth medical brigade Cuba has sent in recent days to combat the spread of the new disease abroad. It has sent contingents to socialist allies Venezuela and Nicaragua as well as Jamaica, Suriname and Grenada. “We are all afraid but we have a revolutionary duty to fulfill, so we take out fear and put it to one side,” Leonardo Fernandez, 68, an intensive care specialist, told Reuters late on Saturday shortly before his brigade’s departure. “He who says he is not afraid is a superhero, but we are not superheros, we are revolutionary doctors.”  Fernandez said this would be his eighth international mission, including one in Liberia during the fight against ebola. Italy is the country that has been worst affected by the highly contagious virus that originated in China, with the northern region of Lombardy bearing the brunt of the contagion. Its death toll rose on Saturday by 546 to 3,095, according to its head of welfare, Giulio Gallera, who requested the Cuban doctors. We are going to fulfill an honorable task, based on the principle of solidarity,” said Graciliano Díaz, 64. Cuba built a healthcare system that was the envy of the developing world with economic aid from former ally Soviet Union, though some of those advances have been lost since the communist bloc collapsed. Many Cuban hospitals have fallen into disrepair and Cubans say they have difficulty finding medicine, a situation the government says is largely due to decades-old U.S. sanctions although analysts blame also the inefficient state-run economy. Still, Cuba has one of the highest ratios worldwide of physicians per capita even when excluding those doctors abroad, and its medical brigades for disaster relief continue to earn Havana goodwill worldwide. “In a time of crisis, the Cuban government, the Cuban people ... have risen to the occasion, they have heard our appeal and they have responded,” Jamaican Health Minister Christopher Tufton said on Saturday upon greeting 140 Cuban medical professionals at Kingston international airport. Britain also thanked Cuba last week for allowing a British cruise ship that had been turned away by several Caribbean ports to dock on the island and for enabling the evacuation of the more than 600 passengers onboard.

However, the argument that there was no impact of any kind on the election outcome is not backed up by the intelligence community’s report. The report specifically stated it didn’t look at that question. Here’s what the report actually said: We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The U.S. Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion. So if the Trump campaign is using the intelligence community report to back up its assertion that there was no Russian influence on the outcome, it's doing so without justification. When we contacted the Trump transition media office, we did not receive a response. Here’s our review of the publicly available evidence. Ballot counts The Trump camp has a point on one issue: Despite some concern among security experts going into the election that Russia might hack into state and local vote-counting systems and tamper with the tallies, the intelligence community report found that any such efforts by Russia were not successful in changing any votes. The report says that while ""Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards,"" the Department of Homeland Security ""assesses that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying."" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, conceded this in an interview with the PBS NewsHour on Jan. 6. ""It is true there is no evidence that the tampering with voter machines or tampering with voter registrations or any of like that affected the counting of the votes. That's true,"" Schiff told PBS’ Judy Woodruff. Some observers might be concerned that Russia did manage to breach at least some election authorities’ computer networks, and they might also be concerned that Russia and Putin, according to the report, tried to influence the election, even if it’s less clear whether they succeeded. Still, Trump has a point that Russia didn’t literally change actual votes electronically. Ballot tampering vs. other types of Russian influence Members of the Trump camp have portrayed the report’s clean bill of health on the question of Russian ballot-tampering as proof that Russia had no impact at all on the election. For instance, on the Jan. 8 edition of CNN’s State of the Union, incoming White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Jake Tapper that ""if you read the full report, they make very clear, (Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper in his testimony (to the Senate Armed Services Committee) made very clear on Thursday under oath that that any attempt, any aspiration to influence our elections failed. They were not successful in doing that."" On Fox News Sunday, incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus echoed Conway’s invocation of Clapper’s testimony, saying Clapper had testified to the Senate panel ""that there is no evidence in the report that any of this changed the outcome of the election."" Neither assertion is accurate. First, to equate a lack of ballot tampering with a lack of any Russian influence on the election conflates two things that are not the same. Conway and Priebus essentially defined ballot-rigging as the only way an election can be influenced, when in reality the intelligence report primarily addresses other ways Russia tried to influence the election. The Russian effort blended, in the report’s words, ""covert intelligence operations — such as cyber activity — with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or ‘trolls.’ "" And second, Clapper in his testimony never said that ""any attempt, any aspiration to influence our elections failed"" (as Conway put it) or that ""there is no evidence in the report that any of this changed the outcome of the election"" (as Priebus put it). Clapper’s most direct remark at the Senate hearing on this issue came in this exchange with the panel’s chairman, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.: McCain: ""So really, what we're talking about, is if they succeeded in changing the results of an election, of which none of us believe they were, that would have to constitute an attack on the United States of America because of the effects, if they had succeeded, would you agree with that?"" Clapper: ""First, we cannot say -- they did not change any vote tallies or -- or anything of that sort."" McCain: ""Yeah, I'm just talking about…"" Clapper: ""And we have no -- we have no way of gauging the impact that -- certainly the intelligence community can't gauge the impact it had on the choices the electorate made. There's no way for us to gauge that."" Subsequently in the hearing, Clapper arguably went even further in a response to questioning by Sen. Angus King, I-Maine. King, referring to his work with Baltic states that have been grappling with Russian influence in elections for several years, said, ""The best defense is for our public to know what's going on, so they can take it with a grain of salt. … That's why I think public hearings like this and the public discussion of this issue is so important, because we're not going to be able to prevent this all together. But we need to have our people understand that when they're being manipulated. Would you agree with that conclusion?"" Clapper responded, ""Absolutely. That's why I feel so strongly about the statement in October,"" referencing his own statement during the campaign that the Russian government had been engaged in efforts ""intended to interfere with the U.S. election process."" How credible is the argument that Russia influenced the election in some fashion? Schiff is one of many Democratic officials who personally believe that other types of Russian efforts may have had an impact on an election that ultimately hinged on fewer than 100,000 votes cumulatively in three states -- Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In his PBS interview, Schiff specifically referred to the hacking and release to websites such as WikiLeaks of personal emails written and received by Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and other top Democrats -- releases that Trump prominently featured during the campaign. ""The daily dumping of information that was damaging to Secretary Clinton and helpful to Donald Trump was hugely consequential,"" Schiff said. But is it possible to move beyond a gut feeling and prove that Russia influenced enough voters to change the election’s outcome? Not really, say political scientists. A campaign as large-scale as a presidential race is buffeted by so many factors that it’s essentially impossible to know for sure that any given factor played a role in determining who won. ""The presidential election, with its national constituency, is decided by multiple, interrelated causes, all of which were necessary but not sufficient,"" said Kyle Saunders, a Colorado State University political scientist. Referring to such factors as the candidates’ personalities and messages as well as the general political environment, Saunders said that ""no one determinate cause can be offered as ‘the’ explanation, and doing so is a fool's errand."" Saunders agreed that one doesn’t have to believe that hacking did affect the election to say comfortably that Trump is wrong to say it absolutely didn’t affect the election -- there's simply no way of knowing either way with any certainty that something affected the outcome. He added that while a reasonable case can be made that the hacking did help Trump, that's informed speculation -- not certainty -- and said there’s no way to know how big a factor it may have been compared to other factors. ""It is difficult to argue that the barrage of damaging information released almost exclusively about Clinton and Democrats did no harm or did not create an atmosphere in which voters questioned her judgment or credibility or dampen support for her candidacy,"" said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. That said, Panagopoulos added, ""in truth, there is no way to know with certainty what the causal impact of Russian involvement was on the outcome of the 2016 election."" Our ruling After meeting with senior intelligence officials about the details of a soon-to-be-released report on alleged Russian hacking, Trump said that activities by foreign governments had ""absolutely no effect on the outcome of this election."" Trump can use the intelligence report to bolster this assertion only in one limited way -- that Russia did not succeed in tampering with vote counts (though it appears to have tried). On the broader issue of whether Russia had any impact on the outcome of the election, the report specifically noted that it didn’t address this issue, and Clapper in his Senate testimony didn’t either. Saying there was no Russian ballot-tampering is not the same thing as saying there was no Russian influence on the election. Political scientists say it’s impossible to move beyond informed speculation about whether there was a Russian impact on the election’s outcome -- or, importantly, whether there wasn’t an impact. Trump’s formulation, echoed by later statements by those in his camp, offers a definitive, broad-brush conclusion that isn’t proven by the evidence, and really can’t be.

406,8952,Getting relief from sexual dysfunction and incontinence caused by menopause,"October 15, 2018","This news release summarizes an observational study on the benefits of CO2 ablative laser treatments for reducing menopausal symptoms like vaginal dryness/itching/burning, painful intercourse, frequent urinating, or incontinence in 94 post-menopausal women. While the release makes the claim that the study “demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness,” it was an observational study which cannot show cause-and-effect. The release notes that this intervention is a subject of debate among experts, and that more studies are needed to confirm the long term efficacy and safety of this approach. It falls short in several areas: it neglects to mention that the FDA warns against using lasers for menopause symptoms, excludes any data from the study, and omits disclosure of significant financial conflicts of interest among study authors and the organization that distributed the release, the North American Menopause Society. It’s estimated that around half of post-menopausal women have at least one of the aforementioned constellation of symptoms that some doctors label “genitourinary symptoms of menopause,” or GSM, and others see as normal (but problematic) symptoms of a low estrogen state. Some women respond well to symptomatic treatment, others may choose hormone replacement, and some struggle to find relief. It’s important to point out that many women seek no treatment at all. For women interested in treatment, finding reliable information can be problematic. Thorough and thoughtful news releases and news coverage should, at the very least, provide:  good data balancing the benefits and potential harms, give a sense of safety and efficacy in comparison to other existing treatments, seek out independent experts not involved in the highlighted study, as well as fully disclose if that study could be biased by conflicts of interest.","Michael Joyce, MD,Dan Mayer, MD,Kathlyn Stone","The cost of CO2 laser therapy is not mentioned. Much of the CO2 laser treatment in the US is applied to skin — often for wrinkles, scars, discolorations, or people who want to look younger. According to WebMD such “laser skin resurfacing” cost an average of $2,330 in 2016. However, it’s unclear if vaginal laser therapy would be comparable in terms of duration, equipment involved, or cost. The release does not offer data to support this statement: This type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness. It further demonstrated that four or five laser therapies may be superior in lowering GSM symptoms compared with three in both short- and long-term follow-up. Readers might correctly guess the improvements reported come from patient questionnaires, but would have no sense of the scale or significance of these benefits. Without supporting evidence they’d also be left wondering which GSM symptoms improved, by how much, and for how long. It also appears that the results after three treatments is very similar to four or five treatments without any evaluation of the side effects. Most importantly, since the study was not controlled and subjects were not randomized, there are multiple confounding factors that could have been responsible for the beneficial results. Not mentioned and extremely relevant based on this June, 2018 publication by the FDA: FDA warns against use of Energy-based devices to perform vaginal ‘rejuvenation or vaginal cosmetic procedures This includes “procedures intended to treat vaginal conditions and symptoms related to menopause, urinary incontinence, or sexual function” Side effects listed include: “vaginal burns, scarring, pain during sexual intercourse, and recurring/chronic pain.” The release does well to point out this is a “small, retrospective, non-sham-controlled study” and that “there is ongoing debate regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaginal laser surgery.” Several key limitations of the study were excluded. The release claims that the study “demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness.”  It should have more directly stated that as an observational study, it cannot show cause-and-effect. In addition, the study could not exclude the possibility that some of the positive outcomes reported by the subjects were due to a placebo effect. The release tells us that “painful sex, dryness, itching/burning, urinary frequency, and incontinence” are symptoms and signs associated with menopause. We’re also told that “collectively” these represent genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) which the gynecologic literature variably describes as either a “condition” or a “constellation of symptoms” associated with low estrogen levels in women. (See this helpful essay from Harvard Women’s Health Watch.) Some readers might be left wondering: “So is GSM a disease? Do I need to have all the symptoms to qualify? Aren’t many of these symptoms part of ‘normal’ menopause? Or, is having such symptoms abnormal and should therefore be treated?” We wish the news release had made it clear that these symptoms can represent normal aspects of aging that many women choose to manage with non-pharmacologic and non-surgical approaches. We’ll give this the benefit of the doubt and rate this satisfactory since it’s debatable whether or not this news release disease mongers. Funding for the study is not included. Also relevant for readers, but not mentioned, is that two of the authors have financial ties to the company that produces the laser tested in this study. Both authors have been expert witnesses for the laser company, suggesting a higher degree of approval of the therapy and potential for bias in the way the study is done. Equally relevant is that the National Menopause Society (NAMS)  — which authored the news release — receives corporate support from about a dozen biotechnology companies, many that sell treatments targeted at GSM. Also, about three-fourths of the NAMS board have disclosed relationships with industry. The news release names some of the many treatments available for managing menopause symptoms through this quote from the executive director of NAMS: Until more data are available, all treatment options, including lubricants, vaginal moisturizers, and FDA-approved vaginal and systemic hormone therapies, should be discussed with women who suffer from GSM to determine the best treatment option for them. It’s mentioned that vaginal laser surgery represents “one of the newer and more hotly contested approaches” to menopause symptoms. So we’ll give this a satisfactory mark, but it would have helped readers to give them a ballpark sense of how widely the surgery is being used in North America. The news release doesn’t say what’s new about the study. Lasers have been used for vaginal atrophy for at least 5 years. It’s not clear from the release how long CO2 lasers have been used for genitourinary symptoms. The release is unjustified in claiming that this observational study demonstrates effectiveness. It made the claim in the following paragraph: The results of this small, retrospective, non-sham-controlled study demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness. It further demonstrated that four or five laser therapies may be superior in lowering the intensity of GSM symptoms compared with three laser therapies in both short- and long-term follow-up. The last paragraph of the release somewhat moderates the hearty endorsement of the therapy.",false,"menopausal symptoms,North American Menopause Society,vaginal laser surgery"
407,14930,Obamacare isn't helping anyone.,"November 11, 2015","Fiorina said that ""Obamacare isn't helping anyone."" Even taking the low end of estimates, tens of millions of Americans have benefited from the ACA, in big ways (such as securing insurance for the first time) or smaller ways (paying less for drugs under Medicare Part D). One does not have to buy into every aspect of the law or feel comfortable with its overall price tag to acknowledge that lots of people have benefited from it.",Louis Jacobson,"The Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare to some -- is a perennial target of Republicans. But at the GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee, Carly Fiorina made a particularly strong statement about the law’s ineffectiveness. ""Look, I'm a cancer survivor, okay?"" Fiorina told moderator Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network. ""I understand that you cannot have someone who's battled cancer just become known as a pre-existing condition. I understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help. But, I also understand that Obamacare isn't helping anyone."" Fiorina’s staff did not respond to an inquiry, but during the debate, she listed a number of problems she has with the law. ""It is crony capitalism at its worst,"" she said. ""Who helped write this bill? Drug companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies. … Health insurance has always been a cozy, little game between regulators and health insurance companies."" Fiorina also said that ""Obamacare is crushing small businesses, it is not helping the families it was intended to help. So, let us allow states to manage high risk pools. Let us try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried, the free market. Let us ensure that as patients, and customers, that we have information to shop wisely for our health care."" Reasonable arguments can be made against the law and its many provisions. But is no one at all getting any actual help from the law? We decided to take a closer look. Here are some of the provisions of the law and estimates of how many people have benefited from each. The estimates are from Charles Gaba, who has spent several years crunching the numbers for usage of the law at the blog ACAsignups.net. Gaba’s estimates are current through November 2015 unless noted: • Americans currently enrolled in policies bought on the ACA’s online exchange: 9.5 million, of which roughly 8 million are receiving subsidies under the law. Another 2.5 million were enrolled in such policies during 2015 but have since dropped their coverage. • Net number of Americans added to Medicaid due to the law: 15 million. This includes 10 million added through direct expansion of Medicaid under the law, 4 million new but previously eligible beneficiaries who signed up for Medicaid after the ACA passed, and about 1 million transferred to Medicaid from existing, state-based programs. • Number of young adults age 19 to 26 who have been able to stay on their parents’ insurance due to the law: Possibly 1 million to 3 million, but the numbers change so often it’s hard to get a solid number. Of the 25 million-plus total from these three categories, Gaba estimates, roughly 17 million are newly insured specifically because of the law -- approximately 5 million through the exchanges, 11 million through Medicaid, and 1 million assorted others. Here are a couple of more ways people are benefitting: • Americans no longer at risk for coverage denial due to pre-existing conditions: As PolitiFact has previously reported, between 19 percent and 50 percent of Americans fall into this category, or between 60 million and 160 million people. • Americans no longer at risk of being kicked off policies for developing expensive medical conditions: Smaller than the previous categories, but unknown. There is some overlap between these categories. But whatever the number is, it’s in the tens of millions -- and most of those people, Gaba said, ""would disagree that it's ‘not helping anyone.’ "" Jonathan Oberlander, a professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, added two additional categories of Americans who have benefited from the ACA: • Medicare Part D beneficiaries, who are getting better prescription drug coverage: 39 million Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in the program. These and other Medicare beneficiaries are also getting such new benefits as free preventive screenings and an annual wellness checkup. • Americans with private insurance who now have access to preventive services at no charge: Unknown, but likely in the millions. Another way to look at it holistically is to gauge the net impact on national uninsurance rates. They have fallen sharply since the law has been put into practice, as this chart from the Kaiser Family Foundation illustrates:  ""The statement is utter nonsense. Put simply, it is a wild exaggeration that amounts to a lie,"" Oberlander said. ""You can certainly debate the overall impact and desirability of Obamacare. But to say it isn’t helping anyone is to ignore both reality and overwhelming evidence to the contrary."" Policy experts who have mixed feelings about the law or oppose it outright say that some of these benefits have come at too high a cost, or have left more people significantly hurt than significantly helped. For instance, Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and who has provided unofficial advice to Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign, said the law has squeezed out many of the more limited-benefit and catastrophic-coverage plans that beneficiaries may have liked, forcing them to pay for more expensive policies. ""This has been a problem for people above 300 percent of the poverty line who get small subsidies, and it’s been a real problem for people above 400 percent of the poverty line who get no subsidy,"" Wilensky said. Michael Tanner, a scholar at the Cato Institute, said there have been both winners and losers, and that he expects that ""the losers far outnumber the winners."" That said, both Wilensky and Tanner agreed that Fiorina went too far in saying that ""Obamacare isn't helping anyone."" ""People on expanded Medicaid or who were previously uninsured and substantially subsidized in the exchange are better off than they were,"" Wilensky said, even if ""they may or may not be as well off as they could be."" Tanner added that, despite his qualms with the law, ""you can’t truthfully say that no one has benefited. Even if you believe that the previously uninsured are paying too much for crummy policies under the ACA, as I do, I don’t think you can say that none of them have benefited at all. That’s a pretty low bar, of course. If you flew across the country dumping money from an airplane, some people would benefit."" Our ruling Fiorina said that ""Obamacare isn't helping anyone."" Even taking the low end of estimates, tens of millions of Americans have benefited from the ACA, in big ways (such as securing insurance for the first time) or smaller ways (paying less for drugs under Medicare Part D). One does not have to buy into every aspect of the law or feel comfortable with its overall price tag to acknowledge that lots of people have benefited from it. We rate Fiorina’s statement .",false,"National, Health Care, Carly Fiorina, "
408,33812,A secret tape recorded aboard the doomed space shuttle Challenger captured the final panic-stricken moments of the crew. ,"February 22, 2001",Reports of a secret tape recorded aboard the doomed space shuttle Challenger that captured the final panic-stricken moments of the crew raised suspicions of a cover-up.,Snopes Staff,"Seventy-three seconds into the 28 January 1986 flight of the space shuttle Challenger the craft broke apart, killing the seven astronauts aboard. Videotapes released by NASA afterwards showed that a few seconds before the disaster, an unusual plume of fire and smoke could be seen spewing from the lower section of the shuttle’s right solid-fuel rocket. It was generally assumed (and NASA did little to disturb this opinion) that all aboard died the moment the external tank blew up. NASA later conceded it was likely that at least three of the crew members aboard remained conscious after the explosion, and perhaps even throughout the few minutes it took forthe crew compartment of the shuttle to fall back to Earth and slam into the Atlantic Ocean. The agency was highly secretive about matters relating to the Challenger tragedy, actively fighting in the courts media requests to be allowed access to photographs of the wreckage, the details of the settlements made with the crews’ families, or the autopsy reports, and this reticence to share information likely convinced some that there was more to the story than was being told. Such an environment breeds its own rumors, and Miami Herald reporter Dennis E. Powell wrote that the crew were likely all alive and conscious until the shuttle’s crew compartment plunged into the Atlantic Ocean: When the shuttle broke apart, the crew compartment did not lose pressure, at least not at once. There was an uncomfortable jolt — “A pretty good kick in the pants” is the way one investigator describes it — but it was not so severe as to cause injury. This probably accounted for the “uh oh” that was the last word heard on the flight deck tape recorder that would be recovered from the ocean floor two months later. As they were feeling the jolt, the four astronauts on the flight deck saw a bright flash and a cloud of steam. The lights went out. The intercom went dead. After a few breaths, the seven astronauts stopped getting oxygen into their helmets. Someone, apparently astronaut Ronald McNair, leaned forward and turned on the personal emergency air pack of shuttle pilot Michael Smith. The PEAP of Commander Francis Scobee was in a place where it was difficult to reach. It was not activated. Even so, if the crew compartment did not rapidly lose air pressure, Scobee would only have had to lift his mask to be able to breathe. Two other PEAPs were turned on. The three others were never found. Though the shuttle had broken to pieces, the crew compartment was intact. It stabilized in a nose-down attitude within 10 to 20 seconds, say the investigators. Even if the compartment was gradually losing pressure, those on the flight deck would certainly have remained conscious long enough to catch a glimpse of the green-brown Atlantic rushing toward them. If it lost its pressurization very slowly or remained intact until it hit the water, they were conscious and cognizant all the way down. In fact, no clear evidence was ever found that the crew cabin depressurized at all. There was certainly no sudden, catastrophic loss of air of the type that would have knocked the astronauts out within seconds. Such an event would have caused the mid-deck floor to buckle upward; that simply didn’t happen. A purported transcript of the Challenger crew’s final horrifying moments  has circulated online for many years, supposedly taken from a “secret tape” leaked from NASA:  A secret NASA tape reveals that the crew of the shuttle Challenger not only survived the explosion that ripped the vessel apart; they screamed, cried, cursed and prayed for three hellish minutes before they slammed into the Atlantic and perished on January 28, 1986. The tape is said to begin with a startled crewman screaming,”What happened? What happened? Oh God – No!” Screams and curses are heard – several crewmen begin to weep – and then others bid their families farewell. Two minutes forty-five seconds later the tape ends. That’s when the shuttles crew compartment, which remained intact after the vessel exploded over the Atlantic, hit the ocean at over 2,000 miles per hour, instantly killing the crew. “Cover up? Of course there was a coverup,” declared Robert Hotz, a member of the Presidential commission that investigated the disaster. “NASA can’t face the fact that they put these astronauts in a situation where they didn’t have adequate equipment to survive. NASA doesn’t give a damn about anything but covering it’s ass,” he said. The official account released by NASA ends with shuttle pilot Michael Smith saying, “Uh-oh!” Some NASA employees have evidently heard more – much more. And they provided the rest of the account based on what they’ve discussed within NASA in the last five years. The astronauts had time and realized something was happening after the shuttle broke up. “All shuttle astronauts carry personal recorders and the tape in question apparently came from Christa’s (McAuliffe), which was recovered after the shuttle disaster,” said Hotz. Jarvis was sitting beside her, and when he figured out what was happening he said, “Give me your hand.” “NASA insists there’s nothing like that on tape but they’re talking about the mission tape, not Christa’s. So they’re not lying, but they’re not telling the truth, either.” A journalist with close ties to NASA was even more emphatic, “There are persistent rumors, dating back to the disaster, that this tape is absolutely bone-chilling.” The following transcript begins two seconds after NASA’s official version ends, with pilot Michael Smith saying, “Uh-oh!” Times from the moment of takeoff are shown in minutes and seconds and are approximate.

There never was such a transcript, nor was the crew of the Challenger known to have been wearing personal recorders. Moreover, personal recorders would not have picked up the comments of crew members on different decks as the faked transcript would have us believe. Not everyone aboard died the exact second the external tank exploded; that much is known. A complete understanding of exactly what happened in that cabin after the explosion remains elusive because the impact of the crash, plus the six weeks the wreckage and bodies spent in the sea, made it impossible to determine precisely when and how everybody aboard died. (Six weeks in sea water would also have ruined any unshielded audio tapes that miraculously survived the explosion and the crash.)",false,"Horrors, Gruesome Discoveries"
409,1500,Israel targets fashion industry over underweight models.,"October 16, 2017","Israeli lawmakers want to tighten a ban on the employment of underweight models and on the undeclared digital slimming-down of fashion images, amid concern that the measures are being routinely flouted even as they are adopted abroad.",Miriam Berger,"The fashion industry’s use of wafer-thin models has long been the subject of heated debate worldwide. Critics say the practice promotes an unhealthy body image among women, which can contribute to triggering anorexia and other eating disorders and a preoccupation with unrealistic measures of perfection. Israel in 2012 became the first country to pass a law requiring advertisers explicitly to identify pictures with photoshopped people and prohibiting the use of models below a certain body mass index (BMI), a measure which expresses a ratio of weight to height. Other countries including France, a hub of the fashion industry, have since followed Israel’s lead. But unlike Israel’s so-called ‘anti-photoshop’ law, French legislation that takes effect this month imposes fines and jail sentences on those who fail to comply. “The problem with the Israeli law is that there’s no punishment,” said Israeli photographer Adi Barkan, who was consulted on both the Israeli and French legislation. “So you continue using skinny girls and no one cares,” he said, in comments reinforced by a recent Israeli parliamentary report that revealed the ineffectiveness of the existing law. Israeli lawmaker Nurit Koran,  with the backing of 42 other members of the Knesset, the country’s parliament, has now prepared a draft bill she hopes will rectify the shortcomings. “The fashion industry needs to know (it can no longer ignore the law),” said Koran, who said she took up the cause after watching the daughter of a close friend struggle with anorexia. The 2012 law, which prohibits the hiring of women and men for modeling jobs with a BMI of less than 18.5, says models must obtain a medical certificate confirming a normal BMI. Adverts shown in Israel must also clearly state whether they have used computer-editing techniques to airbrush or slim down models. Under Koran’s proposed changes, state authorities would for the first time be able to fine agencies and others who flout the law and would require a doctor to see an applicant in person, not just “approve” their application over the telephone. Her move coincides with an announcement by major global fashion firms, including Christian Dior and Gucci, that they will stop hiring underweight models for catwalks. Getty Images, a major international photo agency, also recently issued new guidelines barring photos with slimmed-down models, even if labeled. Yael Latzer, an eating disorder expert at Haifa University in northern Israel, said images of skinny and photoshopped models alone do not cause eating disorders. “(But) young (people) always feel that something is wrong with them,” she said, adding that the media was “pulling the trigger” for those already genetically predisposed to eating disorder diseases such as anorexia. Former Israeli supermodel Maayan Keret said she had developed an eating disorder after she “felt a lot of pressure from everyone” to continually lose weight. Now, having overcome the disease, she works to promote positive body images. “The standards (women and girls) see everywhere of beauty are not natural,” Keret told Reuters. “They see those images. And they think that’s the way it should be.”",true,Health News
410,24624,"Doctors, nurses, hospitals, even the pharmaceutical industry, (and) AARP"" say that health reform ""makes sense to do.","July 27, 2009",Obama says there is widespread support for health care reform,Catharine Richert,"In his recent speech, President Barack Obama said the time is ripe for health care reform because most health care professionals support a new plan. ""The default position is inertia,"" he said during his July 22, 2009, speech on health care when asked why he was so eager to pass health care reform before the end of the summer. ""Because doing something always creates some people who are unhappy... And the fact that we have made so much progress where we've got doctors, nurses, hospitals, even the pharmaceutical industry, AARP, saying that this makes sense to do, I think means that the stars are aligned and we need to take advantage of that."" Obama was talking about some key industry endorsements he picked up for a health care overhaul. In early May, the hospitals, insurers and the drug industry pledged to save $2 trillion in health care spending over 10 years. That victory was followed by a July 8 announcement that hospitals would contribute $155 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings to cover health care cost reform. So, at first blush it seems that Obama is right that the stars are aligned for health care reform. However, we found that some storm clouds are overshadowing Obama’s starry sky. First, it's important to note that there’s a big difference between supporting a health care overhaul generally and supporting the legislation being considered by the House and the Senate. Nearly all industry sectors believe our health care system needs an overhaul. But they disagree on what to change. Those divisions are best illustrated by industry support or opposition to the House and Senate health care bills. Among many other things, both bills would create a government-run insurance option and would require that most employers extend some sort of health insurance to their employees. People would be required to have some form of coverage, and insurers would not be able to deny coverage because of a person’s medical history. The House bill would tax the wealthiest people to help pay for the legislation, while the Senate hasn't unveiled how it will pay for the overhaul. The American Medical Association — a coalition of doctors and medical societies — endorsed the House bill, because the ""legislation includes a broad range of provisions that are key to effective, comprehensive health system reform."" However, several of AMA's members, including the Texas Medical Association, have not endorsed the bill because it includes a government-run health insurance option. Another sticking point is an administration proposal that would create an independent group of medical experts to look for inefficiencies in the Medicare system to save money. The American Hospital Association says the plan will hit rural and teaching hospitals hardest because they get extra Medicare payments to help cover their relatively high cost of doing business. AARP supports the House bill, but believes the Senate bill still needs some work. Specifically, the organization, which represents people over 50, is concerned the bill would prevent some less costly generic drugs from entering the market fast enough. The leading pharmaceutical industry trade group, PhRMA, does not support the House bill, but says the Senate bill ""marks an important step toward achieving comprehensive health care reform."" And the American Nurses Asssociation supports the House bill, but has no clear position on the Senate bill. Those are a lot of details to keep track of, so we've provided you with a handy guide  here  . But back to Obama's claim. He's correct that most in the health care industry support some sort of reform, but when we're talking about the overhauls that have been put to paper — specifically, the House and Senate bills — there is quite a bit of disagreement among hospitals, nurses, Medicare patients, doctors and the drug industry over which plan is best; industry support isn't as rock-solid as Obama would make it seem. As a result, we give him a .",true,"National, Health Care, Barack Obama, "
411,27929,Account by Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin describes his taking Communion on the moon.,"March 7, 2010","Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin said he wanted to perform ""some appropriate symbolic act regarding the universality of seeking"" during the moon landing.",David Mikkelson,"One of the smaller details lost amidst the tremendous historic and scientific achievements of the Apollo 11 mission that landed the first two human beings on the moon in July 1969 was that it also marked the first occasion on which a Christian took the sacrament of Communion on an astronomical body other than Earth. This event took place in the interval between the lunar module’s landing on the moon on 20 July 1969 and Neil Armstrong’s taking his first steps on the lunar surface several hours later; during that period, astronaut Buzz Aldrin privately observed Communion using elements he had brought with him to the moon: Example: Communion on the Moon: July 20th, 1969 Forty years ago today two human beings changed history by walking on the surface of the moon. But what happened before Buzz Aldrin (pictured in the LM, left) and Neil Armstrong exited the Lunar Module is perhaps even more amazing, if only because so few people know about it. I’m talking about the fact that Buzz Aldrin took communion on the surface of the moon. Some months after his return, he wrote about it in Guideposts magazine. And a few years ago I had the privilege of meeting him myself. I asked him about it and he confirmed the story to me, and I wrote about in my book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About God (But Were Afraid to Ask). The background to the story is that Aldrin was an elder at his Presbyterian Church in Texas during this period in his life, and knowing that he would soon be doing something unprecedented in human history, he felt he should mark the occasion somehow, and he asked his pastor to help him. And so the pastor consecrated a communion wafer and a small vial of communion wine. And Buzz Aldrin took them with him out of the Earth’s orbit and on to the surface of the moon. He and Armstrong had only been on the lunar surface for a few minutes when Aldrin made the following public statement: “This is the LM pilot. I’d like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.” He then ended radio communication and there, on the silent surface of the moon, 250,000 miles from home, he read a verse from the Gospel of John, and he took communion. Here is his own account of what happened: In the radio blackout, I opened the little plastic packages which contained the bread and the wine. I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon, the wine slowly curled and gracefully came up the side of the cup. Then I read the Scripture, “I am the vine, you are the branches. Whosoever abides in me will bring forth much fruit. Apart from me you can do nothing.” I had intended to read my communion passage back to earth, but at the last minute [they] had requested that I not do this. NASA was already embroiled in a legal battle with Madelyn Murray O’Hare [sic], the celebrated opponent of religion, over the Apollo 8 crew reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon at Christmas. I agreed reluctantly. I ate the tiny Host and swallowed the wine. I gave thanks for the intelligence and spirit that had brought two young pilots to the Sea of Tranquility. It was interesting for me to think: the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the very first food eaten there, were the communion elements. And of course, it’s interesting to think that some of the first words spoken on the moon were the words of Jesus Christ, who made the Earth and the moon — and Who, in the immortal words of Dante, is Himself the “Love that moves the Sun and other stars.” Aldrin openly described his Communion experience on the moon in print several times, including an August 1969 interview with LIFE magazine, an October 1970 Guideposts article, and his 1973 book Return to Earth. The following account of his motivations and preparation is taken from Aldrin’s 2009 book, Magnificent Desolation: Landing on the moon is not quite the same thing as arriving at Grandmother’s for Thanksgiving. You don’t hop out of the lunar module the moment the engine stops and yell, “We’re here! We’re here!” Getting out of the LM takes a lot of preparation, so we had built in several extra hours to our flight plan. We also figured it was wise to allow more time rather than less for our initial activities after landing, just in case anything had gone wrong during the flight. According to our schedule, we were supposed to eat a meal, rest awhile, and then sleep for seven hours after arriving on the moon. After all, we had already worked a long, full day and we wanted to be fresh for our extra-vehicular activity (EVA). Mission Control had notified the media that they could take a break and catch their breath since there wouldn’t be much happening for several hours as we rested. But it was hard to rest with all that adrenaline pumping through our systems. Nevertheless, in an effort to remain calm and collected, I decided that this would be an excellent time for a ceremony I had planned as an expression of gratitude and hope. Weeks before, as the Apollo mission drew near, I had originally asked Dean Woodruff, pastor at Webster Presbyterian Church, where my family and I attended services when I was home in Houston, to help me come up with something I could do on the moon, some appropriate symbolic act regarding the universality of seeking. I had thought in terms of doing something overtly patriotic, but everything we came up with sounded trite and jingoistic. I settled on a well-known expression of spirituality: celebrating the first Christian Communion on the moon, much as Christopher Columbus and other explorers had done when they first landed in their “new world.” I wanted to do something positive for the world, so the spiritual aspect appealed greatly to me, but NASA was still smarting from a lawsuit filed by atheist Madalyn Murray O’Hair after the Apollo 8 astronauts read from the biblical creation account in Genesis. O’Hair contended this was a violation of the constitutional separation of church and state. Although O’Hair’s views did not represent mainstream America at that time, her lawsuit was a nuisance and a distraction that NASA preferred to live without. I met with Deke Slayton, one of the original “Mercury Seven” astronauts who ran our flight-crew operations, to inform him of my plans and that I intended to tell the world what I was doing. Deke said, “No, that’s not a good idea, Buzz. Go ahead and have communion, but keep your comments more general.” I understood that Deke didn’t want any more trouble. So, during those first hours on the moon, before the planned eating and rest periods, I reached into my personal preference kit and pulled out the communion elements along with a three-by-five card on which I had written the words of Jesus: “I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me.” I poured a thimbleful of wine from a sealed plastic container into a small chalice, and waited for the wine to settle down as it swirled in the one-sixth Earth gravity of the moon. My comments to the world were inclusive: “I would like to request a few moments of silence … and to invite each person listening in, wherever and whomever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way.” I silently read the Bible passage as I partook of the wafer and the wine, and offered a private prayer for the task at hand and the opportunity I had been given. Neil watched respectfully, but made no comment to me at the time. Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind — be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists. But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo 11 experience that by giving thanks to God. It was my hope that people would keep the whole event in their minds and see, beyond minor details and technical achievements, a deeper meaning — a challenge, and the human need to explore whatever is above us, below us, or out there. Some sources asserted that Aldrin’s taking of Communion was kept “secret” from the public by NASA due to an ongoing lawsuit filed by atheist Madalyn Murray O’Hair: The story of the secret communion service only emerged after the mission. Aldrin had originally planned to share the event with the world over the radio. However, at the time Nasa was still reeling from a lawsuit filed by the firebrand atheist Madalyn Murray O’Hair, resulting in the ceremony never being broadcast. After the Apollo 8 crew had read out the Genesis creation account in orbit, O’Hair wanted a ban on Nasa astronauts practising religion on earth, in space or “around and about the moon” while on duty. She believed it violated the constitutional separation between church and state However, it’s not completely true that the public was kept in the dark about the event until many years later. Although Aldrin maintained that NASA asked him not to broadcast his observance of Communion, news accounts released while the Apollo 11 mission was in progress reported that Aldrin was bringing Communion bread with him to the moon and would be joining Earth-bound parishioners in observing Communion from the lunar surface, as noted in this 20 July 1969 Associated Press dispatch: Astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. went to the moon today with a piece of Communion bread he will use there to symbolize fellowship with his home church on earth. When the Rev. M. Dean Woodruff [minister of the Webster Presbyterian church where Aldrin was an elder] brought out the bread for Communion, a portion of the loaf had been broken away. The minister explained that Aldrin took a portion of the loaf with him on the moon trip and at some time during the afternoon, after the moon landing is made, Aldrin would symbolically join the other parishioners in Communion during one of his rest periods. Buzz Aldrin’s observance of Communion was dramatized in an episode of the 1998 HBO mini-series From the Earth to the Moon:",true,"History, apollo 11, buzz aldrin, moon landings"
412,377,Quebec appeals court upholds C$15 billion tobacco class action ruling.,"October 1, 2015","The Court of Appeal of Quebec upheld on Friday the bulk of a 2015 decision that awarded around C$15 billion ($11.29 billion)to smokers in the Canadian province, dealing a blow to Big Tobacco.","Allison Lampert, Martinne Geller","The judgment involves class action suits that were consolidated against the Canadian subsidiaries of British American Tobacco, Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International, known respectively as Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc (RBH) and JTI-Macdonald Corp. The companies were appealing a 2015 Quebec Superior Court ruling to award damages to some 100,000 Quebec smokers and ex-smokers who alleged the companies knew since the 1950s that their product was causing cancer and other illnesses and failed to warn consumers adequately. The province’s Council on Tobacco and Health, a non-profit smoking-prevention group that was also a plaintiff in the suits, said the “historic judgment” would cost the companies almost C$17 billion ($12.79 billion), reflecting additional interest since 2015. RBH said in a statement that it will try to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. JTI-Macdonald said it would consider that option. While big tobacco companies in the United States have faced lawsuits for decades, the Quebec class action marked the first time tobacco companies went to trial in a civil suit in Canada. “This is a huge defeat for the tobacco industry,” said Rob Cunningham, senior policy analyst from the Canadian Cancer Society. “The Court of Appeal did reverse the Superior Court on some relatively minor points, but that does not materially change the overall result.”  The judgment comes as Big Tobacco firms are pouring billions into vaping devices that deliver nicotine through vapor they say is less harmful than smoke, and as smoking rates fall in many countries. The two Quebec suits, called the Letourneau and Blais cases, were filed in 1998 and certified as class actions in 2005. They were consolidated into one before the 2012 start of trial proceedings, which ended in 2014. JTI-Macdonald said in a statement it “fundamentally disagrees” with the court’s judgment and that Canadians “have had a very high awareness of the health risks of smoking.”   A spokesman for Imperial Tobacco Canada told reporters at the Montreal courthouse the company was “disappointed” with the decision. British American Tobacco Finance Director Ben Stevens told analysts on Thursday that the Canadian cases would likely take years to play out in the courts. British American Tobacco said in a statement late on Friday: “Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. needs to review the court’s decision in more detail and will decide on next steps over the coming days and weeks.”",true,Health News
413,8723,Hunt on for 'patient zero' who spread coronavirus globally from Singapore.,"February 13, 2020","As lion dancers snaked between conference room tables laden with plastic bottles, pens, notebooks and laptops, some staff from British gas analytics firm Servomex snapped photos of the performance meant to bring good luck and fortune.","John Geddie, Sangmi Cha, Kate Holton","But the January sales meeting in a luxury Singapore hotel was far from auspicious. Someone seated in the room, or in the vicinity of the hotel that is renowned for its central location and a racy nightclub in the basement, was about to take coronavirus global. Three weeks later, global health authorities are still scrambling to work out who carried the disease into the mundane meeting of a firm selling gas meters, which then spread to five countries from South Korea to Spain, infecting over a dozen people. Experts say finding this so-called “patient zero” is critical for tracing all those potentially exposed to infection and containing the outbreak, but as time passes, the harder it becomes. “We do feel uncomfortable obviously when we diagnose a patient with the illness and we can’t work out where it came from...the containment activities are less effective,” said Dale Fisher, chair of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the World Health Organisation. Authorities initially hinted at Chinese delegates, which included someone from Wuhan - the Chinese city at the epicentre of the virus that has killed over 1,350 people. But a Servomex spokesperson told Reuters its Chinese delegates had not tested positive. Fisher and other experts have compared the Singapore meeting to another so-called “super-spreading” incident at a Hong Kong hotel in 2003 where a sick Chinese doctor spread Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome around the world. The WHO has opened an investigation into the Singapore incident, but said its “way too early” to tell if it is a super-spreading event. It was more than a week after the meeting - which according to a company e-mail included Servomex’s leadership team and global sales staff - that the first case surfaced in Malaysia. The incubation period for the disease is up to 14 days and people may be able to infect others before symptoms appear. The firm said it immediately adopted “extensive measures” to contain the virus and protect employees and the wider community. Those included self-isolation for all 109 attendees, of whom 94 were from overseas and had left Singapore. But the virus kept spreading. Two South Korean delegates fell sick after sharing a buffet meal with the Malaysian, who also passed the infection to his sister and mother-in-law. Three of the firm’s Singapore attendees also tested positive. Then cases started appearing in Europe. An infected British delegate had headed from the conference to a French ski resort, where another five people fell ill. Another linked case then emerged in Spain, and when the Briton returned to his home town in the south of England the virus spread further. “It feels really scary that one minute it’s a story in China... and then the next minute it is literally on our doorstep,” said Natalie Brown, whose children went to the same school as the British carrier. The school said in a letter that two people at the school had been isolated. “It’s scary and sobering how quickly it seems to have spread,” said Brown. Back in Singapore, authorities were battling to keep track of new cases of local transmissions, many unlinked to previous cases. Management at the hotel - the Grand Hyatt Singapore - said they had cleaned extensively and were monitoring staff and guests for infection but did not know “how, where or when” conference attendees were infected. The lion dancers, who posted photos of the event on Facebook, said they were virus free. “Everyone assumes it was a delegate but it could have been a cleaner, it could have been a waiter,” said Paul Tambyah, an infectious diseases expert at National University Singapore. He added it was “very important” to find “patient zero” to establish other possible “chains of transmission”. But time may be running out. Singapore health ministry’s Kenneth Mak said the government will continue to try and identify the initial carrier until the  outbreak ends, but as days pass it will get harder. “We might never be able to tell who that first patient is,” Mak said. Meanwhile, the fallout from the conference continues to sow trepidation weeks after the event and thousands of miles away. Reuters visited Servomex’s offices in the suburbs of South Korea’s capital, Seoul. It was closed and dark inside, and a building guard told Reuters employees were working from home. A notice posted by building management stated a coronavirus patient had entered the complex, while several young women could be overheard in a nearby elevator discussing whether it had been used by the infected person. “Do you think the patient would have gotten on this elevator or the other one?” one said.",true,Health News

A government official escorted me to the test site, a table outside the entrance of a shuttered hotel. A single medical worker sat there, dressed in a zipped-up hazmat suit and goggles. She asked for my personal details and told me to sit. She then stuck a swab down my throat, nearly triggering a gag, and then it was over. “You’ll get your results in about one and a half days,” the official said. The test, while not pleasant, took less than three seconds. Wuhan is testing liberally as it tries to get back up and running after lifting a 76-day lockdown last week. The term “nucleic acid test” has become a familiar one in the city of 11 million people, where many companies are asking workers to present test results before they can return to work, although it is not mandatory. At one Wuhan hospital, people only need to spit into a test tube. That test costs 260 yuan ($37) and results are available by mobile app. Since Feb. 21, 930,315 tests have been carried out in Wuhan, according to government data. “Testing is a good thing,” said Zhao Yan, a emergency medicine doctor and vice president of Wuhan’s Zhongnan Hospital told reporters on a government-organised trip last week. “If you’re an enterprise with 500 employees and you want to start working again, you test everybody.”  Across China, officials are simplifying and speeding up the process to obtain a nucleic acid test, even though questions persist about its accuracy. Some Chinese doctors have pushed to raise requirements for discharging hospitalised patients from two negative nucleic acid tests to three. Cities including Beijing have required some arriving travelers to present test results when entering. China has not yet indicated it will require testing for large swathes of the population.

While the isolated nation, located more than 1000 kilometers (621 miles) north-east of Fiji, has not recorded any COVID-19 cases, some of its residents are worried it is ill-equipped to combat the epidemic. “When it comes, we don’t have the resources to prevent and cure, that’s why it’s a big concern to me,” musician Sio Silva told Reuters in the Samoan capital of Apia on Monday. “We don’t know if it’s inside our island already but don’t have the resources to test it.”    The Pacific region has recorded six cases of COVID-19 - three in French Polynesia and three in Guam - although most island nations cannot screen for the virus onshore which is potentially masking its spread. The Samoan government said in its most recent health update on March 14 that there were no suspected or confirmed cases of coronavirus. Pacific countries have been tightening their border controls to prevent the coronavirus from gaining a foothold in isolated islands with limited health resources. All incoming air travel to the United States-backed Marshall Islands have been banned. Travelers going to Samoa, a twin-island nation of approximately 200,000 people, must obtain a medical clearance report before boarding their flight, and passengers are screened on arrival. White medical tents located near the main airport that were recently used to isolate measles patients will now be used to quarantine suspected coronavirus sufferers, the government said. Last year’s measles outbreak killed 83 Samoans, mainly young children, in a health emergency that was only brought under control less than three months ago after a mass vaccination drive. “We have to be prepared, anytime that the coronavirus might come and infect us, we have to get ready for that,” Naomi Iona, a radio announcer, told Reuters in Apia.",true,Health News
417,22644,I lowered taxes over the last two years.,"February 7, 2011",Barack Obama said he lowered taxes over the past two years,Angie Drobnic Holan,"In an interview on Super Bowl Sunday, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked President Barack Obama to react to a Wall Street Journal editorial that accused Obama of being ""a determined man of the left whose goal is to redistribute much larger levels of income across society."" ""Do you deny that you are a man who wants to redistribute wealth?"" O'Reilly asked. Obama first noted the robust conservatism of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, then denied the charge ""absolutely."" ""I didn't raise taxes once. I lowered taxes over the last two years,"" Obama said. We wanted to fact-check that statement, and we'll begin by saying Obama boils down an awful lot of complexity about federal tax policy into a short sound bite. Looking at the whole statement, he's both right and wrong. For clarity's sake, we're going to take Obama's statement in two parts. Here, we'll look at his statement, ""I lowered taxes over the last two years."" In a separate report, we checked the statement, ""I didn't raise taxes once"" and rated it False. Obama has raised taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning, and the health care law includes a tax penalty on the uninsured. The health care law also includes new taxes on the wealthy, increasing the rates they pay on Medicare hospital taxes starting in 2013. For this one, we'll begin by noting that Obama has not raised income tax rates. Obama and Senate Republicans compromised on tax legislation at the end of 2010, leaving in place the same income tax rates for all tax brackets. (The extensions were necessary because the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush would otherwise have increased last month.) It's also true that Obama has successfully supported tax reductions for workers who make less than $200,000 a year or couples who make less than $250,000. Obama kicked off his tax cuts for workers with the economic stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. He asked for tax cuts of $500 per worker per year; Congress agreed to $400. The tax cuts -- called Making Work Pay -- were implemented in early 2009 and people saw small increases in their paychecks. The Obama administration liked giving people the money in their paychecks every week or two -- as opposed to mailing one big check -- because administration economists thought people would be more likely to spend the money and stimulate the economy. But the increases were small enough that a lot of people didn't notice them. A New York Times/CBS News Poll in September showed that fewer than one in 10 people knew that the Obama administration had lowered taxes for American workers. Those tax cuts expired at the end of 2010. But as part of last fall's tax compromise with Republicans, Obama won a different type of tax cut for workers: a 2 percent reduction in payroll taxes that go to Social Security. Keep in mind that normally workers pay 6.2 percent in payroll taxes on up to $106,800 of their earnings. (Employers pay another 6.2 percent, while the self-employed are generally on the hook for the full 12.4 percent.) The new tax cut means workers will pay only 4.2 percent of their earnings. So that lowered taxes for workers. Generally speaking, people who make more than $20,000 will get an even bigger tax cut than they did under Making Work Pay. (Workers who makes less than $20,000 will likely be worse off, but they'll still be paying lower taxes than in 2008.) The tax compromise was a complicated piece of legislation, and not everybody ended up better off. Nevertheless, about 80 percent of tax payers end up with a tax cut under the deal, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. And the broad-based tax cuts on income are significantly larger than the new excise taxes, said Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center. So yes, a majority of Americans have seen reduced taxes under President Obama. But he's also taken steps to increase a few taxes like cigarettes and tanning over the past two years.

420,9516,CAR-T therapy makes early inroads in treating brain cancer,"January 3, 2017","This story in STAT, like the one in TIME.com that we also reviewed, describes the successful, and apparently first positive response of a glioblastoma brain tumor to CAR-T therapy. This is an experimental immunotherapy that depends on on injections of modified immune cell proteins and that has had a few successes in blood cancers but essentially none in solid tumors, including those in the brain. Described in a report in the The New England Journal of Medicine, the study was conducted and promoted by officials and physicians at the City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and Medical Center, an organization that has a somewhat unfortunate history of touting treatments as bringing about “miracles” and encouraging coverage of compelling individual cancer patient stories to support sometimes exaggerated claims of major advances in cancer treatment. This STAT story does a better job than TIME of putting what is essentially a single, unexpected experimental result into perspective. Its strongest points are that it avoids touting this one patient’s experience as any kind of broad “success,” calling it an “early inroad;’ emphasizing its “notorious” potential side effects; and most of all quoting sources outside City of Hope who made clear that, as one put it, the success was possibly a “flash in the pan.” Bravo. One thing that would have made the story stronger? Early on emphasizing how a single case study makes for weak evidence. See our six tips for writing accurately about cancer immunotherapy drugs. Unlike the TIME story (see our review), this story included important voices of caution to help keep expectations in check. Starting with the headline, readers of this story are likely to come away with a more realistic perspective on this treatment. (Meanwhile, TIME’s headline was misleading: “Experimental Brain Cancer Treatment Is a Success.”)","Joann Rodgers, MS,Dan Mayer, MD,Joy Victory","As we noted in our review of TIME Magazine’s story as well: Although there may not yet be any accurate prediction of the cost of the particular therapy described for this single patient, it is generally well established and well documented that immunotherapies–particularly those that involve modifying a patient’s own immune cells–are many times more expensive than standard treatments, sometimes running to annualized costs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. This story says nothing about this. The article notes that the patient was in remission for seven months, but like the TIME article, says nothing specifically about what the patients tumor status was during those seven months. If the tumors shrunk, it would be at least useful to know the baseline measurements and degree of shrinkage and disappearance, as well as any improvements or (setbacks) in quality of life. This was a tough call, but we’re leaning toward satisfactory. On one hand, the STAT story does acknowledge the downsides, so far, of CAR-T therapy, by referring to the adverse events as “notorious” and providing a link for more information. On the other hand, the story only mentions that severe side effects have occurred without telling us any of those side effects and what the side effects (if any) were for the one patient treated. Instead it says the patient’s side effects were “fairly innocuous” and quotes a researcher early in the story saying “it’s amazing how safe it was.” Yet, this hardly proves it’s safe. See our tips for reporting accurately about the harms, side effects and risks of immunotherapy. The story does make it clear that this was an intervention tested in a single patient, and includes cautious statements from experts. This is a barely passing satisfactory–we think the story could have more emphatically said that any single case study cannot and should not be used to generalize the efficacy of any therapy until more reliable studies are done. No mongering here regarding the brain cancer glioblastoma. Job well done in quoting sources outside of the City of Hope investigators and putting the findings into cautious perspective throughout the article. If the story was to be done at all (a debatable decision), this article makes the best of the context problem. Very few details of conventional alternative treatments are included, but the story points out that glioblastoma is resistant to most treatment options. Still, the story should have noted that alternatives include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. The STAT story notes the availability of CAR-T commercially (by naming the companies) for blood cancers, and it quotes an outside source as essentially saying “don’t hold your breath” awaiting the viability of this treatment for glioblastoma. The article does a brief but adequate job of describing what is newsworthy here–how this experimental CAR-T is being used for solid tumors for the first time. The story possibly may have started with the news release, but it reflects useful additional outside reporting.",true,"brain cancer,immunotherapy"

Some people could continue to die of the virus as late as July, although deaths should be below epidemic levels of 10 per day by June at the latest, according to the analysis. The analysis, using data from governments, hospitals and other sources, predicts that the number of U.S. deaths could vary widely, ranging from as low as around 38,000 to as high as around 162,000. The variance is due in part to disparate rates of the spread of the virus in different regions, which experts are still struggling to explain, said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who led the study. The duration of the virus means there may be a need for social distancing measures for longer than initially expected, although the country may eventually be able relax restrictions if it can more effectively test and quarantine the sick, Murray said. The analysis also highlights the strain that will be placed on hospitals. At the epidemic’s peak, sick patients could exceed the number of available hospital beds by 64,000 and could require the use of around 20,000 ventilators. Ventilators are already running short in hard-hit places like New York City. The virus is spreading more slowly in California, which could mean that peak cases there will come later in April and social distancing measures will need to be extended in the state for longer, Murray said. Louisiana and Georgia are predicted to see high rates of contagion and could see a particularly high burden on their local healthcare systems, he added. The analysis assumes close adherence to infection prevention measures imposed by federal, state and local governments. “The trajectory of the pandemic will change – and dramatically for the worse – if people ease up on social distancing or relax with other precautions,” Murray said in a statement. The analysis comes as confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States continue to mount, with the World Health Organization saying the country has the potential to become the world’s new epicenter of the virus. The coronavirus causes a respiratory illness that in a minority of severe cases ravages the lungs and can lead to death. The United States has reported around 70,000 cases of the virus and more than 900 deaths since January. Globally, it has infected more than half a million people, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The University of Washington has been at the center of the outbreak in United States, which first was detected in the state of Washington and has so far killed 100 people in that state, according to date from Johns Hopkins University.",true,Health News

","October 18, 2017","Bushfires have wiped out about half the koalas living on a coastal reserve in New South Wales, experts estimated on Friday, as a record number of intense fires rage around the Australian state.",  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"A fierce early start to the bushfire season brought a blaze at the Lake Innes Nature Reserve that destroyed two-thirds of the koalas’ habitat last month, leaving the rest under threat from one of 15 major blazes in the southeastern state. About 350 koalas living on the reserve in the north coast town of Port Macquarie have died in the bushfires, the group Koala Conservation Australia estimates. That compares with a total population of 500 to 600 in the reserve, said the group’s president, Sue Ashton. Animal carers at the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital nearby have been nursing rescued koalas, bandaging their wounds and feeding them eucalyptus leaves and formula. “We look for signals of pain - teeth grinding, distress - and we just take it on a day-by-day basis,” said Amanda Gordon, who leads the team of carers, adding that some of the marsupials’ health problems can be hard to spot. “Sometimes koalas seem to be doing really, really well. Their paws might be healing up but if something’s going on that we can’t see there’s not really much we can do,” added Gordon, who has worked at the hospital for 15 years. The carers estimate at least 10 days will be needed to assess the full damage to the koala population. Population estimates for koalas, native to Australia, vary widely, from as few as 50,000 to little more than 100,000. They dwell mostly in eucalyptus forests in eastern states and on the coastal fringes, usually living up to 20 years, carrying their young in a pouch and sleeping for up to 18 hours a day. Warmer weather brought by climate change threatens to worsen conditions for koalas, as deforestation has narrowed habitable areas, said James Tremain of the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales. “Devastating bushfires are going to knock out some of these key population centers, but so also will increasing temperatures,” he said, by affecting the nutrition value of the leaves that are the animals’ sole food source. “Koalas are definitely in trouble in New South Wales, but if the declines continue at the same rate as the last 20 to 30 years, koalas could be extinct in the wild by mid-century,” Tremain added.

European power generators, industrial emitters and airlines running flights within the EU must buy permits to cover their emissions. “The results of fighting coronavirus will be painful. It is obvious that countries will be looking for extra money to help their business and citizens,” Janusz Kowalski, Deputy Minister of State Assets, told Reuters on Tuesday. “Poland and other countries should take care of the climate on their own, and the ETS should be removed from 1 January, 2021, or at least Poland should be excluded from the system.”  The coronavirus has killed five people and infected 205 in Poland, which has barred foreigners from entering, shut schools and capped public gatherings at 50 people. Kowalski suggested the government could discuss the proposal after the coronavirus has peaked. “This will be the time for taking various unconventional, political decisions on all levels,” Kowalski said. Poland generates most of its electricity from coal. Kowalski said he would expect other states in central and eastern Europe to support the proposal. Poland is the only EU state that refused at a December summit to commit to climate neutrality by 2050. But the Czech prime minister said on Monday the EU should focus for now on fighting the coronavirus rather than its “Green Deal” policy package to tackle climate change, and Kowalski said he agreed. Asked about Kowalski’s remarks, the EU executive, the  European Commission, said it could not speculate on the potential implications of COVID-19, the respiratory illness the virus causes, in individual policy areas. “While our immediate focus is on combating COVID-19, our work on delivering the European Green Deal continues.

427,423,These Houston residents dream of moving to where the air is clear.,"March 21, 2016","On the east side of Houston, the white plumes of the Texas oil and chemical refineries are a constant backdrop for residents of the Manchester neighborhood.",Loren Elliott,"Late at night or early in the morning when plants burn off excess gases, the flames light up the whole sky in the neighborhood. Some residents say the air has a chemical-based smell that they find hard to describe but disappears once they drive a few miles away from the homes that stretch along the Houston Ship Channel, a waterway connecting the plants to the ocean. They claim that the pollution is taking a toll on their health, although the scientific evidence does not prove that. “I want to get out of here and go to the country and find some cleaner air,” said Eugene Barragan, a 56-year-old electrician who has lived most of his life by the refineries. “It would be better for me and the kids.”  Doctors have found four lumps in his lungs and now more growths, according to the chest X-rays and medical records he showed Reuters. The first ones were not cancerous. Barragan says he has not been able to afford imaging of the new growths. He hopes they are benign so he can watch his children grow up. “When I work hard, I start coughing and coughing and can’t stop,” he said. “I know a lot of people who have problems like that.”  Lillian Riojas, Valero Energy Corp’s chief spokeswoman, said the company has worked to reduce pollution at its refinery since purchasing it in 1997. In the 22 years since Valero took over the refinery, ambient benzene levels have dropped 63% to 0.34 parts per billion, according to data from 1997 to 2019 from Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. “There’s a narrative that air quality is getting worse, but that’s not what the emission data is showing,” Riojas said. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which enforces federal and state environmental laws, gives Valero’s refinery the top compliance level possible, said Andrew Keese, a spokesman for the agency. The other nearby refineries and chemical plants earned a compliance rating of satisfactory. Of the other plants bordering Manchester, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co has the second highest-rating for compliance with environmental regulations, Keese said. Goodyear “implemented several changes that resulted in lower emissions from our facility,” said Connie Deibel, a company spokeswoman. LyondellBasell Industries, TPC Group [TPCL.UL] and Flint Hills Resources, which operate facilities near Manchester, did not reply to requests for comment about pollution in the area. A 2007 study, the most recent available, of nearly 1,000 childhood cancer cases by the University of Texas found children living within 2 miles (3 km) of the Houston Ship Channel had a 56% higher risk of contracting acute lymphocytic leukemia than children living within 10 miles (16 km) of the Ship Channel. Researchers’ analysis suggests an association between childhood leukemia and air pollution. However the study, funded by Houston’s health department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, could not prove the pollutants caused the illnesses. For years, Dennys Nieto wanted to leave the neighborhood but was only recently able to afford to move her and her family to a different part of Texas. “I suffer from asthma and pain in my lungs. It feels like I’m being hit in the lungs,” Nieto said of her old neighborhood. “Headaches, inflammation and pain in my throat. And also I have erratic blood pressure and heartbeat.”   She checks her blood pressure and listens to her heart beat regularly. “In the air I feel it’s this we’re all breathing. This is why I want to leave from here,” Nieto said of the Manchester area. “I want to go somewhere that is far from the refineries so that I can repair my life, repair my health and live better.”  (See related photo essay here here)",true,Environment
429,22953,"Joe Barton Says you can buy four light bulbs for $1.99 at Walmart, while a single compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) costs ""$10 a pop.","November 21, 2010",Rep. Joe Barton says a four-pack of incandescent bulbs cost $1.99 while one CFL bulb costs $9.99,Ciara O'Rourke,"No secret: Many a GOP congressman wants to repeal the new health care law. Also on U.S. Rep. Joe Barton's legislative bucket list? Retooling energy policy, he said during a Nov. 11 speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation, where the Ennis lawmaker specified something else he'd like to repeal. ""In a bill that passed in 2007 or 2008, we prohibited in a few years the sale of incandescent light bulbs, like the one that's shining on me right now from the back of the room,"" he said. ""And I was at Walmart this weekend buying some light bulbs and the traditional incandescent light bulb I believe you can get four for $1.99. The little squiggly pig-tail ones were one for $9.99."" Then the dig: ""Now, if you're Al Gore, you can afford $10 a pop for squiggly-pig-tailed fluorescent light bulbs. But if you're mainstream America, two or three kids, mom and dad working outside the home, that's not a very good deal. So I think repeal that law right off the bat to show that we're going to put market forces back into play. We'll show the American people that we're serious about an energy policy that actually produces energy for America."" Since we're not Al Gore, we wondered if we're getting a bad deal: $9.99 for a compact fluorescent lamp — the squiggly pig-tailed bulb Barton mentions, also known as a CFL — versus $1.99 for a four-pack of traditional bulbs. First, some background: In 2007, Congress voted to improve the efficiency of light bulbs. Then-President George W. Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which set energy efficiency standards for kinds of incandescent lamps (conventional light bulbs) and fluorescent lamps (CFLs). Barton voted against it — the law Barton now wants to repeal ""right off the bat."" While running for president, Barack Obama promised to sign a measure into law that ""begins to phase out all incandescent light bulbs."" He said the change would save Americans $6 billion a year on their electric bills. Last year, PolitiFact reported that no such proposal has made it into law, though in June 2009, Obama announced changes in lighting standards. Starting in August 2012, fluorescent tube lamps (most commonly found in offices and stores) and conventional incandescent reflector lamps must become more efficient. The government said those types of lamps represented approximately 45 percent of total lighting energy use. This isn't the first time Barton has spoken out against CFLs. On Sept. 16, Barton and two other representatives introduced a proposal to repeal the section of the act requiring that bulbs use 30 percent less energy than standard incandescents. In a press release from Republicans on the committee, Barton said that ""Washington is making too many decisions that are better left to people who work for their own paychecks and earn their own living."" Nick Prelosky, an intern in Barton's office, told us that Barton's point was ""that the CFLs are more expensive... a lot more expensive than the incandescent bulbs."" Barton's press office didn't return our calls on this topic, and after initial communications with Walmart's corporate headquarters, no one answered our queries. So we don't know which Walmart Barton shopped — there's one in his hometown of Ennis — or what the light bulb options were at the store. But at a Walmart Supercenter in Austin, we found a wide selection of bulbs and prices. We found a 15-watt dimming CFL bulb for $11.77 and a four-pack of 100-watt soft-white incandescent bulbs for 84 cents, an even greater price spread than Barton said. But a dimming CFL bulb that costs more than $10 vs. a four-pack of incandescents that costs about $2 isn't exactly apples to apples. We turned to a comparison of CFL and incandescent wattage by Energy Star, a joint federal program of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy. According to Energy Star, a 60 watt incandescent bulb produces a minimum light output of 800 lumens, about what a 13 to 15 watt CFL bulb produces. At the store, we found a six-pack of 13-watt CFL bulbs for $7.97. A three-pack was $4.28. Next, we went shopping online. Our ""light bulb"" search query on Walmart's website returned 136 hits. Again, bulb prices varied. A three-pack of soft-white 13-watt CFL bulbs costs $4.92, according to Walmart's website. A two-pack of soft-white 60-watt incandescents costs $2.54. That's $1.64 per CFL bulb and $1.27 per incandescent. On the pricier end was a two-pack of three-way CFLs for $19.84, which are only sold online, according to Walmart's website. That's $9.92 per bulb — the price Barton bemoans. A two-pack of three-way incandescent bulbs costs $4.26, or $2.13 per bulb. But bulb life is also a factor in cost comparisons. In August 2009, Consumer Reports reported that ""swapping regular bulbs for compact fluorescents can save you at least $30 per bulb over the life of a compact fluorescent lightbulb... Some CFLs now cost less than $2 compared with $9 to $25 in 1999. Several lasted five to 10 times as long as regular bulbs in our tests, and Energy Star-qualified models use up to 75 percent less power."" In its October issue, Consumer Reports found that the CFL bulbs in its lab ""have been cycling on and off since early 2009, or 6,000 hours. For comparison, a typical incandescent bulb lasts only around 1,000 hours."" Lastly, we checked in with the Light Bulb Shop on Austin's Burnet Road. When we explained the statement we were fact-checking, Martin Day, a salesman at the store, told us: ""You can get cheaper CFLs than $10."" The cheapest CFL the store sells costs about $3 each, he said — a four-pack for $12. The cheapest incandescent: 75 cents. Let's review the math. One 13-watt CFL bulb costs as little as $1.30 (the price for a six-pack divided by the number of bulbs), compared to 20 cents for an equivalent 60-watt incandescent bulb. But it would take at least five incandescents to replace it over the average life of a CFL. However, if you want a dimmable CFL, it will definitely cost you. On their face, the prices cited in Barton's statement hold up. Yes, you can go to Walmart and buy a four-pack of incandescent bulbs for $1.88 (online) or 84 cents (at the Austin Supercenter) — prices even lower than Barton aired — and a single CFL bulb for $11.77 (even more than he said). However, Walmart also sells some CFLs for less and other incandescent bulbs for more. More importantly, Barton ignores other relevant factors — wattage and longevity — that undercut a simple price comparison and his suggestion that a ""mainstream,"" two-income family can't afford such energy-saving bulbs. We rate his statement as Barely True. This story has been updated to correct the cost of a 13-watt CFL bulb to $1.64 Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to .",false,"Energy, Regulation, Texas, Joe Barton, "
432,2326,Poorer countries lack midwives to cut birth deaths: report.,"June 3, 2014","The majority of the world’s poorer countries, which account for nearly all childbirth-related deaths among newborns and mothers, are facing a critical shortage of professional midwives who could ease the problem, global health experts said on Tuesday.",Susan Heavey,"Among 73 lower and middle income nations, just four - Armenia, Colombia, Dominican Republic and Jordan - have adequate resources in place, according to a review led by the United Nations Populations Fund and the World Health Organization. “More than three-quarters face serious shortages that will result in unnecessary deaths of women and babies,” Frances Day-Stirk, president of the International Confederation of Midwives, told reporters on a conference call. Midwives, who are trained to deliver babies and provide medical care before and after pregnancy, can provide most of the services needed for women and newborns, experts said. That is critical to relieve pressure on doctors, especially in areas where medical resources are scarce or difficult to access. In 2013, there were an estimated 2.6 million stillbirths, 3 million newborn deaths and 289,000 maternal deaths. More than 92 percent of those deaths occurred in the countries reviewed, the groups said in their “State of the World’s Midwifery” report. The countries included in the review range from China, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan to Central African Republic, Chad, Guatemala and Mexico, among others. Many lack the infrastructure necessary to allow for quality care from midwives, and often don’t have regulatory systems in place to adequately train them, according to the report. Collecting necessary data is also a problem. “Women and girls’ right to maternal and reproductive health are essential,” Babatunde Osotimehin, a physician and executive director of the UN’s Populations Fund, told reporters. They “need and deserve respectful, compassionate care before, during and after pregnancy and birth ... This is not the case in many countries. This needs to change.”  The crisis is also an economic one, experts said. For example, boosting midwifery services can reduce costly cesarean births, saving up to $128.5 million over three decades, Day-Stirk said. One country that has shown some gains is Bangladesh, where the government in 2010 launched an effort to train 3,000 midwives, helping reach key health goals even though birth-related mortality remains high, experts highlighted. The report, funded by the UN along with the U.S. and Canadian governments, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other groups, and Johnson & Johnson, is part of the UN and WHO’s larger effort to boost access to midwives by 2030.",true,Health News

But why?,David Mikkelson,"A popular video has puzzled countless viewers who have stumbled across it on the Internet, leaving them wondering about both its genuineness and its context. What could prompt a middle-aged woman to haul off and deliver a solid punch to the face of another woman, all without causing any apparent consternation to the bystanders who witnessed the attack? The scene took place in 1999 outside a courtroom where a reckless driver had just been sentenced for causing an accident that left two people dead and a third severely injured. This clip was taken from (originally unaired) videotape shot by a news crew from station KY3-TV in Springfield, Missouri, and was used in a “Newsroom Ethics” lesson prepared by the Radio and Television News Directors Foundation, who described it thusly:  On April 15, 1998, Dana Defeo, Terry Batson and Ed Watson completed their shift at a local factory. The three coworkers piled into Batson’s car and socialized late into the night at a local pub. At 1:15 a.m., they started home. Moments later their car was hit by Tim Massey. He had 11 driving violations, including one ticket for going 104 miles per hour. This night police said he was driving more than 100 miles per hour when he sped through an intersection and crashed into Batson’s car. Two of the three coworkers died. Only Dana Defeo survived, but with severe brain damage. Massey survived and was charged with manslaughter. More than a year later, Massey stood before a judge, who sentenced him to five years in prison. After the sentencing, outside the courtroom, a drama unfolded. Friction was apparent between the families of Dana Defeo and Terry Batson. Accusations that the dead victims had been smoking marijuana and unfaithful to their spouses were flying between the families. A member of Terry Batson’s family heard the allegations and punched the accuser in the mouth. The graphic and startling smack in the mouth was captured on camera. No charges were filed. Nobody was arrested. The station had sensational videotape on its hands, but the assault had nothing to do with the story that had unfolded in the courtroom. KY3-TV, after a lengthy newsroom discussion, decided not to air the video but did mention the argument and the punch in a tag to the main story about the sentencing for the two traffic deaths.",true,"Fauxtography, Oddities"

So far, more than 14,576 people with COVID-19 have died in British hospitals, though new official data indicates the true death toll could be much larger. “Where were the system errors that led us to have probably the highest death rates in Europe?” Anthony Costello, professor of International Child Health and Director of the UCL Institute for Global Health, asked at the Health and Social Care Committee. “We have to face the reality of that: We were too slow with a number of things,” Costello told the committee. “We could see 40,000 deaths by the time it’s over.”  Costello, a paediatrician who is an expert in epidemiology, said the government should make sure its response to the second and additional waves of infection was not too slow. The government also faced separate criticism over its supply of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for health workers. The Guardian newspaper said shortages meant guidelines were being relaxed, and that doctors might need to treat patients without wearing full-length protective gowns. Ministers on Friday acknowledged a shortage of gowns - departing from their position that there were adequate supplies of PPE but some logistical problems getting it to where it was needed. The health department did not immediately comment on the Guardian report. Britain has the fifth-highest official death toll from COVID-19 in the world, after the United States, Italy, Spain and France, though the UK figure only covers hospital fatalities and the real number is probably much higher. British ministers have defended their response to the outbreak, saying they followed scientific advice and have responded with urgency in what amounts to a war-like situation. Costello said the United Kingdom needed wide-scale testing and the right systems in place to deal with further flare-ups of the outbreak. “The recent estimates, even from the chief scientific officer, is that after this wave - we could see 40,000 deaths by the time it’s over - we could only have maybe 10%, 15% of the population infected or covered,” he said. “So the idea of herd immunity would mean another five, six waves maybe in order to get to 60%,” he said. “We have got to pray the vaccinologists come up.”  The government launched a new initiative on Friday to coordinate British efforts to find a vaccine, although business minister Alok Sharma said any such solution would take many months and refused to set out a timetable. COVID-19 TESTING  Health minister Matt Hancock said mass community testing was part of the British strategy, though the government has yet to find an antibody test that is accurate enough to be used. “It is part of the strategy - we will be introducing it when we can,” he told the parliamentary committee. He said testing was being expanded to include the police, the fire service, prison staff, critical local authority staff, the judiciary, and the work and pensions ministry. Hancock was also questioned by lawmakers about the daily death toll data - which gives hospital deaths but ignores deaths at home or in care homes. Hancock said the rate of deaths due to COVID-19 in care homes was higher than the 2% of the total indicated by official data, adding he was concerned about how the novel coronavirus was spreading in places housing vulnerable people. “We do know the number of people who die outside hospital and they very largely die at home,” he said.",true,Health News

But Zack Hoopes, the Sentinel business editor who captured the quotes, told PolitiFact Pennsylvania he stands by the article’s accuracy. Despite of the severity of Eichelberger’s accusation, the senator doesn’t challenge that he actually said this. Eichelberger’s office gave PolitiFact Pennsylvania the following statement yesterday: ""He’s never denied saying that, but the comment was taken out of a larger conversation on education and how we prepare our students for the future. The larger context is lost in the story. What has been reported was a brief snippet of an elaborate conversation with local residents. The observations were made about options in our education system during an hour-and-a-half of discussion. It wasn’t perfectly worded, but it is something that needs to be discussed, so instead of misplaced outrage, the Senator would prefer to see an open and honest conversation."" So, on with the fact-check! Eichelberger’s office shared no evidence to substantiate his claim. PolitiFact Pennsylvania wasn’t able to find studies that make similar arguments in our research, that a ""less intensive"" track would be lead to more success for ""inner city"" students, and the academics we spoke with weren’t familiar with papers that could back that up either. Julia C. Duncheon, an expert on college readiness for urban students based at the University of Texas at El Paso said that is was ""not true"" that lower-income students needed ""less intensive"" instruction. In fact, studies show the opposite: ""Those who have taken the more rigorous classes are more likely to persist in college,"" she said. The Institute for Higher Education Policy emphasizes the importance of ""a rigorous, college-ready curriculum, starting in middle school,"" calling this ""crucial."" Education researchers regularly identify that low-income students in cities often lack access to bona fide college preparatory coursework. In an email, pointing to a 2009 Center for American Progress report that espouses high standards in college prep curricula, Duncheon noted that certain demographics see particular gains. ""While rigorous academic preparation is important for all students, it is especially important for African American and Latina/o students,"" wrote Duncheon. ""Again, we see equity gaps decrease among college students who have completed a rigorous academic course load in high school."" Duncheon found Eichelberger’s recommending vocational tracks problematic. ""We tend to see low-income students funneled into those,"" said Duncheon. As inadequate access to high-level classes persists in underserved neighborhoods, poor students of color are underrepresented in these courses. ""The notion that they pursue vocational education is troubling because we’re already dealing with problems of racial segregation with vocational education."" Duncheon was careful not to discourage vocational training, saying that students need ""a variety of pathways."" ""There are too many students getting less intensive education anyway,"" said Ivory Toldson, editor of the Journal of Negro Education and a professor at Howard University. In 2012, Toldson co-authored the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation report ""Challenge the Status Quo: Academic Success among School-age African American Males."" They had several recommendations for better preparing black boys: many pushed fostering supportive, bias-free environments in school and at home, but they also recommended ""offer[ing] a curriculum that, at a minimum, meets the admissions requirements for the most competitive public university of your state."" ""What I found in my analysis was that black and Latino students in urban districts like Philadelphia were the least likely to take high-level math and science courses which limited their opportunities,"" said Toldson. ""The short of it is: I think what the senator is proposing is actually the opposite of what they need."" Toldson argued that modern technical instruction not only could bear benefits for some students, but relies on a comprehension of math and science that corresponds to the digital age. ""We don’t want to give kids the outdated notion that to be an auto mechanic you don’t need math,"" he said. ""That may have been true in the ’50s and ’60s, but that’s not true today."" Duncheon didn’t want to dismiss that dropouts are a persistent problem for low-income students. But, she said, ""there’s a lot of complexity around why students drop out. There’s no clear cut reason why they do, there’s a lot of factors."" Certain trends that researchers like Duncheon have observed pertain to financial restraints and first-generation college students. A 2012 American Institutes for Research report noted that only 10 percent of college dropouts left due to academic struggles. Half of their respondents cited something more hazy, ""personal reasons."" ""Academics are definitely a piece of it, but it’s not the full story,"" she said. Eichelberger declined repeated requests for interview, but his office did share this statement as well: ""Each child has different skills that may be best suited for college or vocational training. This has been recognized by educational experts in our state and around the nation. The best option for kids should be available for all students, whether in Carlisle or Philadelphia or anywhere else in the Commonwealth. ""Vocational training is not an offensive term and should not be treated as such. Vocational education is a path for training and education that leads to higher incomes and family-supporting jobs. For many, it is their stepping stone for success. ""We cannot continue to protect a system that is failing children. If our students are not being provided with that guidance and options in a significant way, then we need to take a closer look at that to ensure that every student deserves the chance to succeed no matter their skin color or economic situation."" Our Ruling Eichelberger said, Inner-city students ""fall back and don’t succeed, whereas if there was a less intensive track, they would."" While there are experts who support offering vocational education to low-income students, we were not able to find any research that backs Eichelberger’s comment. To the contrary, studies show that low-income students with experience in accelerated courses fare better in college. We rate this statement .",false,"Education, Race and Ethnicity, Urban, Pennsylvania, John Eichelberger, "
436,1079,"As measles returns, U.S. states look to cut vaccine exemptions.","May 2, 2019","Maine could soon prohibit parents from citing religious or personal beliefs to avoid vaccinating their children, making the U.S. state one of a half dozen cracking down during the nation’s largest measles outbreak in 25 years.",Jonathan Allen,"State legislatures in New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, Minnesota and Iowa are looking at similar bills that would only allow exemptions from vaccinations for medical reasons as determined by the child’s doctor. The United States has recorded at least 704 measles cases so far this year in outbreaks that U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has called ""completely avoidable."" here  Azar and other officials have largely blamed the outbreaks on the spread of misinformation, including a belief debunked by scientific studies that vaccine ingredients can cause autism. This has led to pockets of lower-than-normal vaccination rates in some communities. U.S. public health officials declared measles eliminated in 2000, meaning the disease was no longer a constant presence in the country. The current outbreak traces its roots to travelers to countries including Ukraine and Israel facing outbreaks. Maine’s Democratic-controlled Senate could vote on the vaccine measure as early as Thursday. The state’s Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed it last month in a nearly party-line vote, with some Republicans arguing it represented inappropriate government intrusion into personal belief. Ryan Tipping, a Democratic member of Maine’s House of Representatives who sponsored the bill, noted in an interview that no major U.S. religion forbids vaccination. “I worked with a lot of people of very strong faiths on this bill, and, when people look, it’s hard to find a religious objection to the incredible amount of good that making these diseases far more rare has brought to the world,” Tipping said. Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, did not respond to questions about whether she would sign the bill into law if it passes the Senate. It was unclear whether the similar bills in other states will pass. Some have been reintroduced after failing in earlier sessions. Other states are considering less restrictive steps to increase vaccination rates. Washington is poised to pass a bill that would remove exemptions on personal grounds for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, while leaving in place a religious exemption. Maine has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with 5 percent of kindergartners holding a non-medical exemption from vaccination, compared to a national average of 2 percent, according to CDC data. The World Health Organization has said at least 95 percent of a community must be immunized against measles to achieve the “herd immunity” needed to protect those unable to get the vaccine such as infants and people with compromised immune systems. No measles cases have been recorded in largely rural Maine since 2017, but state officials have been worried by outbreaks of whooping cough, another childhood disease that can be prevented by vaccination. The largest U.S. measles outbreak this year has been in New York City, clustered in the Orthodox Jewish communities in the borough of Brooklyn, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and city public health officials. All 50 states require children to be vaccinated for various diseases in order to attend public schools, unless they have medical reasons for exemption. Only three states already bar all non-medical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures: Mississippi, West Virginia and California. While most states allow religious exemptions, Maine is one of 17 states that let parents also opt out based on personal or moral beliefs. California outlawed non-medical exemptions in 2015 after a measles outbreak was traced to the Disneyland theme park. The state saw the proportion of kindergarten students who received all mandated vaccines rise to 95.1 percent last year, from 92.8 percent in 2015. It also saw the number of claimed medical exemptions rise to 0.7 percent from 0.2 percent. Officials have blamed this in part on unscrupulous doctors issuing spurious exemptions, prompting lawmakers to consider new legislation that would give the state the final say over whether a medical exemption is valid.

437,30389,Rep. Debbie Dingell is introducing a bill that would lead to widespread gun confiscations.,"May 14, 2018","“This is commonsense legislation that would give law enforcement a tool to ensure individuals deemed a threat to themselves or their community get help, protecting their due process while keeping them safe and their families and communities safe,” she said.",Arturo Garcia,"An April 2018, a Fox News appearance by Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan led to another round of stories from right-wing blogs promoting the fear of widespread gun confiscations. Dingell, a Democrat, was interviewed by the right-wing network about her work co-chairing a working group alongside Republican Fred Upton concerning mass shooting attacks at schools. The network preceded her interview by reporting that police in Seattle were “seizing guns.” In fact, there has been one reported instance of an involuntary gun seizure in Washington state through the use of an extreme risk protection order (ERPO for short) since the law was approved by voters in November 2016. During her appearance, Dingell said that she intended to introduce a federal version of the “red flag” laws that allow for use of ERPOs by law enforcement which are currently in effect in Washington and four other states, which contain guidelines through which individuals or police officers can petition courts to issue ERPOs if they believe that a gun owner may be a danger to themselves or others. Many of the blogs accusing Dingell of preparing to act out against gun owners cite the same Washington Post story — mislabeled as an original report by the Salt Lake City Tribune, rather than a republication — saying, “In Indiana, law enforcement can confiscate weapons without a judge’s order. The gun owner must ask the court to get the weapons returned.” This, too, is inaccurate; the law states that in the case of a firearm seizure without a warrant, police must submit “a written statement under oath or affirmation” to the circuit or superior court with jurisdiction over the gun owner explaining their reasoning for doing so: If the court finds that probable cause exists to believe that the individual is dangerous, the court shall order the law enforcement agency having custody of the firearm to retain the firearm. If the court finds that there is no probable cause to believe that the individual is dangerous, the court shall order the law enforcement agency having custody of the firearm to return the firearm to the individual. On 9 May 2018, Dingell and Upton joined two other lawmakers, Republican Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana and Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch of Florida, in introducing H.R. 5717, which would provide grants to states that adopt their own version of “red flag” laws. “In the weeks since the horrific shooting in Parkland, Florida, I have met with law enforcement, prosecutors, mental health experts, the ACLU, students, teachers, parents, and other stakeholders to find common ground,” Dingell said in a statement: One of the biggest takeaways from these conversations is that we need to provide family members and law enforcement the tools needed when they know someone is a threat to themselves or others. According to a statement sent to us by her office, the bill requires officers who seize a firearm without a warrant to file documentation regarding the seizure to the appropriate court within 48 hours. The court would also hold a hearing on the issue within 21 days of the seizure to determine whether the firearm owner is dangerous. Dingell is listed as a co-sponsor on the bill. In July 2017 she introduced a separate gun-related bill, H.R. 3207, which would make it illegal to “knowingly sell or dispose of a firearm to a person who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of stalking.” It would also expand misdemeanor domestic violence crimes “to include the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, by a current or former intimate partner.” Dingell sent us a statement saying that the new bill is based on Indiana’s “red flag” law, which won support from both Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels and the GOP-controlled state legislature.",false,"Politics, fox news, gun control, guns"
441,2620,Balkan drought highlights years of farm neglect.,"August 21, 2012","As crops wilt and die in the Balkans, farmers struck down by a particularly harsh drought this year are ruing the region’s failure to upgrade irrigation networks and invest in a long-term agricultural strategy.",Daria Sito-Sucic,"Hot, dry weather in eastern and southern Europe has piled pressure on world grain markets already reeling from huge drought damage in the United States. The toll in Bosnia, where surface soil temperatures in the south have hit 47 degrees Celsius (116 Fahrenheit), is estimated at almost $1 billion - a huge blow to a country where the farming sector accounts for 20 percent of employment and about 10 percent of economic output. The cost to neighboring Serbia, where agriculture last year accounted for about 12 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), is around $2 billion, and up to $250 million in Croatia, where yields have also been halved. “It’s a disaster,” said Zoltan Pinkert, a farmer in the fertile flatlands of Baranja in north-east Croatia. “Everything was top-notch, and then the drought came. We’ve had less than 10 percent of the rain compared to normal years, and the damage to corn crops is 100 percent.”  The region is no stranger to drought and farmers usually get by until the next growing season. But producers in Bosnia say things have not been so bad since the end of the country’s 1992-95 war and are threatening to block major roads and border crossings from early September unless the government pays outstanding subsidies and acts to protect domestic production. The future looks bleak. Cash-strapped governments in the region, all facing recession, say the money is not there to invest in modern farming methods. The former Yugoslavia is still plagued by weak governance and a tradition of wholesale change in policy and personnel with each change of government, impeding the creation of a long-term strategy to develop farming. Bosnia does not have an agriculture ministry at the state level but only at the level of its two autonomous regions - the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb Republic. Policy-making is hostage to a complex system of power-sharing since the war, based on ethnic quotas, slowing the adoption of myriad laws and regulations needed for the country to catch up with the European mainstream. This institutional inertia already threatens to deprive Bosnia of its main export market for milk and meat in Croatia when Zagreb joins the EU next year. Critics argue the problem has been years in the making. “We are paying for the lack of systematic agricultural policy over the past 20 or even 50 years,” said Damir Kovacic, agricultural marketing lecturer at Zagreb University. “We’re always surprised when the drought hits in the summer,” he said. The World Bank, which in May approved a $40 million loan to improve the irrigation system in Bosnia, said the countries of the Balkans had huge agricultural potential, but lacked the infrastructure and strategy. “Former Yugoslavia used to have one of the most advanced irrigation and drainage systems,” said Holger Kray, the World Bank’s lead officer for agriculture and rural development in Europe and Central Asia. “Unfortunately, these systems have degraded, eroded,” Kray told Reuters by telephone from Washington. “This is not only about functional budgetary shortages but also frequent turnover in the management of these systems.”  Mate Brlosic, head of the Croatian Agriculture Chamber, said corn would be “as rare as gold” in Croatia this year. “The recovery will last several years for vineyards and orchards, and livestock farming will also feel the impact for years, due to lack of cattle food,” he told Reuters on Monday. “We’ve not had a clear agricultural strategy for 20 years. Regulations change with every change of power.”  The difference upgraded farming methods can make is illustrated by a few green fields in Bosnia’s breadbasket Kalesija region. “We have used modern technology to improve the water regime in some fields and switched to a new animal feeding mix,” Dzenadin Veispahic, general manager of the privately owned Spreca dairy farm, told Reuters. Even then, the drought will cost the farm more than $300,000 this year. “We are on yellow alert regime when it comes to cattle watering,” he said, meaning the farm was negotiating with local authorities to tap river water and enlist the help of the fire brigade. Vladimir Usorac, head of the farmers’ association in Bosnia’s Serb Republic, said the effects of bad harvests were cumulative. “This is the fourth consecutive year that agriculture has suffered enormous losses because of bad weather, and many producers will not have the means to start the production cycle next year,” he said. Experts estimate it would cost about $2.5 billion to overhaul irrigation networks in Serbia, the biggest agricultural producer in the former Yugoslavia. But there is little sign of such a long-term strategy emerging. The focus, instead, is on emergency remedies. In Serbia, where the corn yield is expected to be half the projected 7 million metric tons, trade officials last week called on the government to ban the export of grain, in particular corn, soybean, sunflower seed and wheat. Such a move would spell additional uncertainty for regional markets, particularly Bosnia, which have traditionally relied on Serbia in the event of shortages. Croatian unions want tax on food cut so producers are not priced out of the market, but the government is resisting. Agriculture Minister Tihomir Jakovina said the Croatian government was considering a partial lifting of fees on the lease of agricultural land and increasing customs fees on exports of grain and corn to avoid shortages. The only glimmer of hope for Croatia is the EU funds that will become available when it becomes the bloc’s 28th member in July next year, money that could be invested in a long-term strategy to revive farming. Deputy Prime Minister Radimir Cacic has compared the country’s approach to agriculture to that of “primitive tribes”. “If there is rain, there will be crops, there will be electricity,” he said in the run-up to last year’s election. “If there is drought, there’ll be nothing. This has to change.”",true,Environment
443,15316,Obama Makes Huge Move to BAN Social Security Recipients From Owning Guns,"July 30, 2015","Bloggers such as the Conservative Tribune wrote headlines like this one: ""SPREAD THIS: Obama Makes Huge Move to BAN Social Security Recipients From Owning Guns."" This is a vast exaggeration of the actual policy under consideration. It would not affect all Social Security recipients, but rather those who have already been declared mentally incompetent, and thus ineligible under current law from purchasing a gun. And it is targeted at blocking gun purchases, not taking away guns from people who already have them. Only in California could the policy lead to increased gun seizures, and only -- potentially -- for mentally incompetent residents of the state who would be newly added to the background check database. Obama has not made a sweeping move to disarm gun-owning senior citizens, as these websites claim.",Christian Belanger,"After the shooting in Charleston, S.C., that left nine African-American worshippers dead, President Barack Obama made it clear where he directs the blame. ""Every country has violent, hateful, or mentally unstable people,"" Obama said. ""What’s different is not every country is awash with easily accessible guns."" Though efforts to enact comprehensive gun control legislation through Congress withered amid intense opposition from gun rights supporters, Obama has done what he can to use executive orders to curb access to guns. One potential policy for his administration would have the Social Security Administration share information with the national background check system that is used to conduct background checks of gun purchasers. Adding names from the Social Security list would potentially increase the number of people barred from purchasing a gun. After this possibility emerged, gun-rights advocates reacted quickly and aggressively. ""SPREAD THIS: Obama Makes Huge Move to BAN Social Security Recipients From Owning Guns,"" read the headline in the Conservative Tribune. Breitbart, another conservative website, declared: ""Obama’s Secret Plan to Block Seniors on Social Security from Owning Guns."" Other websites qualified their message by referring to ""some Social Security recipients,"" and some cited a specific figure -- 4.2 million -- as the number of people that would be unable to own guns. We were curious to see how all these claims stacked up, so we dug into the evidence. The background check system Under existing federal law, several factors can prevent someone from buying a gun. Most of these have to do with law enforcement issues, such as a prior felony conviction or a record of domestic abuse. Mental-health issues can be another factor, such as involuntary commitment to a mental institution. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, is supposed to streamline the process of gun purchasing by quickly weeding out those who cannot legally buy a gun. In 36 states or territories, the FBI performs all background checks, whereas the remaining 25 states set up their own state agencies to either conduct full or partial background checks. But such a system is only as good as the databases it’s linked to -- and several analyses have shown that these databases are far from complete. If someone is ineligible to purchase a gun but their information didn’t get into the right database, then the background check won’t stop the purchase. For instance, suspected Charleston shooter Dylann Roof should have been ineligible to buy a gun because of a prior felony on a drug charge, but errors in paperwork, and a mistake by the FBI examiner in charge of the background check, meant that Roof passed the check. The Los Angeles Times article The source that every site we found linked back to was a July 18 Los Angeles Times article, headlined, ""Obama pushes to extend gun background checks to Social Security."" The article reports that the Social Security Administration is crafting a new policy that would prevent gun purchases by certain types of beneficiaries. The ineligible beneficiaries would be those who were deemed mentally incompetent. In this instance, a mentally incompetent person would be categorized as someone who has their finances handled by another party, known as a ""representative payee."" The Social Security change did not emerge suddenly. It stems from an executive order by Obama in January 2013 that required ""require federal agencies to make data available to the federal background check system."" The idea behind the executive order was to make the background check database more complete and prevent gun purchases by people who, under the law, are ineligible. We found several problems with the websites’ claims. • The new policy would not ban all Social Security recipients from owning guns. Rather, it would only affect the small fraction who are deemed mentally incompetent, and who are thus are barred from purchasing guns under the law. • The policy is not yet in force. When we reached out to the Social Security Administration, a spokesman responded, ""We are still developing our policy."" In developing the plan, the Social Security Administration is following the lead of another federal agency, the Veterans Administration, which is already sharing names with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The Social Security Administration’s policy is expected to be similar. • The policy would not take away guns from people who already own them. There is no indication that this policy would take guns away from people who already own guns. Rather, the policy would affect the ability of some mentally incompetent people from buying new guns. ""There is nothing in the policy that would change the definition of who may possess a gun, nor anything that extends the federal government’s authority to take guns away from those who already have them,"" said Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University. There is one exception to this: California currently tracks and disarms ineligible gun owners. In addition to seizing the guns of those people determined to be mentally unstable, California law enforcement also disarms people with felonies or a domestic violence restraining order. The new policy, once it’s instituted, could marginally increase the number of mentally incompetent individuals living in California who are disarmed under that 2013 law. What about the charge that 4.2 million people would be affected by the policy? There’s some truth to it, but there’s an important caveat: 2.7 million of the beneficiaries who have their finances managed by others receive Social Security because of a mental disability, not just because of their age, according to LaVenia LaVelle, a spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration. So it’s not really accurate to say, as Breitbart did, that the plan is ""to block seniors"" from buying guns, since a large number of those affected would not be seniors. Data from December 2013 shows that about 1.2 million disabled workers with mental disorders who were receiving Social Security disability were under 50. Finally, some of these people may already be in the database for another reason. Our ruling Bloggers such as the Conservative Tribune wrote headlines like this one: ""SPREAD THIS: Obama Makes Huge Move to BAN Social Security Recipients From Owning Guns.""

Gaza has 13 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, all in quarantine. Israel has maintained a blockade of the enclave for more than a decade, saying the measure is necessary to stop weapons and funds from reaching its enemy Hamas, an Islamist group that runs Gaza. But Colonel Sharon Biton of COGAT, an Israeli defence ministry office that liaises with the Palestinians, said it was cooperating with “representatives of the international community” to maintain public health in Gaza. Israeli and Palestinian officials said that in addition to the testing kits, Israel has allowed a PCR machine into the territory. The equipment analyses testing samples to determine whether they contain the genetic fingerprint of the coronavirus. The machine was donated by a U.S.-based charity, Qidra said. “During the next week we aspire to be able to buy a good quantity of testing kits to bring into Gaza,” said Abdelnaser Soboh, director of the World Health Organization’s sub-office in the territory. Qidra said that on Monday, hundreds of Palestinians stranded outside Gaza will begin arriving home and would require tests.

449,30854,Law enforcement agencies recommend that people wash the handle on shopping carts before using them to avoid potential exposure to fentanyl.,"November 7, 2017","Because everything used to create this claim has later been walked back, we rank it as false.",Alex Kasprak,"As public health officials and politicians raise alarms over a growing opioid epidemic in the United States, concern over the potential for accidental contact with the extremely potent drug fentanyl have become a prominent fixture on the Internet. Illustrative of this point is a chain e-mail that has hit our inbox multiple times: You know when you go to Wal-Mart and they have the wipes to clean your cart handle? Well, I use them and always thought of the germs only. I read today that the police chief also suggests you do it also because of the dangerous side effects of drugs nowadays. If someone has Fentanyl still on their hands and they touch the cart you are touching, it can get into your system. Scary but worth taking the time to clean the handle. All you’d have to do to get it into your system is rub your nose or a mother touch her child’s mouth. I never even considered this happening but here in the tri-state area there have been officers exposed and even children exposed to the residue from the powder. There are two aspects of this story to note. The first is that the original claim has its origins in a Facebook post by the Leachville Police Department in Arkansas which they have now removed and apologized for. The second is that the ability for an overdose to occur through incidental skin contact is extremely unlikely. While it’s true that fentanyl can legally be prescribed in the United States in the form of a transdermal patch, which regulates a controlled release of the drug into the system via the skin, such a system is specifically engineered to penetrate the top layer of the skin. Much of the concern over accidental fentanyl contact, however, comes not from legally prescribed fentanyl, but black-market fentanyl in the form of a white powder. While the risk of overdose from this powder (which is potentially 80 times as potent as morphine and which can cause death in doses as low as 2 to 3 milligrams) via oral consumption is both acute and increasingly prevalent, experts have cast doubt on the reality of the risk of overdose from skin contact with this power or its residue. A high-profile incident in May 2017, in which a police officer potentially came into contact with fentanyl residue while searching a suspected drug dealers car in Ohio brought those fears to the forefront, was reported by NBC News at the time in the following way: Patrolman Chris Green of the East Liverpool Police Department had just finished searching the car of two suspected drug dealers and was back at the police station when another officer spotted some white powder on his shirt. […] Without thinking, he brushed it off with his bare hand — and passed out about an hour later […]. It took four doses of Narcan to revive him. However, experts later questioned this account. Jeremy Samuel Faust, an emergency medicine physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School, wrote in a piece for Slate that while it is possible that Green inhaled or accidentally ingested the powder, he found the account of its effects to be dubious, at best: Neither fentanyl nor even its uber-potent cousin carfentanil (two of the most powerful opioids known to humanity) can cause clinically significant effects, let alone near-death experiences, from mere skin exposure. If Green’s story is true, it would be the first reported case of an overdose caused solely by unintentional skin contact with an opioid. In that same piece, Faust cites Ed Boyer, a medical toxicologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who explains how crucial the differences between the powder and the patch form of the drug are: Fentanyl, applied dry to the skin, will not be absorbed. There is a reason that the fentanyl patches took years [for pharmaceutical companies] to develop. Further confusion on this issue can be attributed to a June 2017 document from the Drug Enforcement Administration briefing first responders on the risk of fentanyl. That document makes numerous references to the risk of overdose from skin contact with powdered fentanyl, and at the time of that document’s release, this was also the position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. However, these organizations have since revised that stance due to lack of research on the topic, a position in agreement with a recent position statement by the American College of Medical Toxicology. As reported by Vice News: Stephanie Stevens, a spokesperson for the CDC and NIOSH, said the change was made after the agency’s staff determined “there was not enough evidence to validate the statement that dermal exposure to fentanyl is deadly.” Stevens noted that there is “limited research” on the subject, and said the CDC is “actively looking to study and better understand” the health risks of skin exposure to fentanyl. On [12 July 2017], the American College of Medical Toxicology issued a new position statement on the drug, stating that “incidental dermal absorption is unlikely to cause opioid toxicity.” It called the risk of first responders overdosing from touch alone “extremely low.” It should also be noted that the DEA briefing document from which the Leachville Police Department’s claim appears to have its origins also explicitly warns against using alcohol based sanitizers (which applies to shopping cart wipes) to remove fentanyl, for fear that this could make skin more susceptible to absorbing the drug: Do NOT use hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizers may contain alcohol, a skin penetrant, which may increase the absorption of fentanyl through the skin. Therefore, even if this document were based on the most recent science, the police departments interpretation of it would still be flawed. While accidental ingestion would in theory be a possibility, the scientific plausibility of overdose through skin contact alone has been called into question.",false,"Medical, drugs, fentanyl, opioids"

451,26128,“Why did the state do that with COVID patients in nursing homes? It’s because the state followed President Trump’s CDC guidance.”,"June 13, 2020","The Cuomo administration issued an advisory March 25 that stated that nursing homes ""must comply with the expedited receipt of residents” coming from hospitals, regardless of whether they are infected with the new coronavirus. The CDC warned nursing homes to keep COVID-19 out of their facilities and said nursing homes can admit coronavirus patients, but only if they are able to properly care for them. The Cuomo administration says that regulations that predate the pandemic require nursing homes to admit only those patients for which they can care. However, in the month following the March 25 advisory, nursing home operators felt that they had no choice but to accept these patients.",Jill Terreri Ramos,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, facing criticism for how the state handled COVID-19 in nursing homes, has said his administration followed guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately 6,000 nursing home residents in New York have died from the virus, and Cuomo was asked on May 20 about calls for a federal probe into how the state handled nursing homes, and in particular, a March advisory that sent COVID-19 patients from hospitals to nursing homes. ""I’m not going to get into the political back and forth, but anyone who wants to ask, why did the state do that with COVID patients in nursing homes? It’s because the state followed President Trump’s CDC guidance,"" Cuomo said. Is Cuomo correct? We looked at federal guidance at the time of the state's March 25 order, as well as other state Health Department actions at that time. Before the state Health Department sent its controversial March 25 advisory, which has since been withdrawn, the CDC released guidance for nursing homes. The CDC cited two ""key factors"" to consider when deciding whether to discharge a patient with COVID-19 to a long-term care facility, said Kristen Nordlund, a CDC spokesperson. First, is the patient medically ready for discharge to a long-term care facility? And second, is the selected long-term care facility able to safely care for a patient recovering from the virus by implementing all recommended infection control procedures? These directives were in place on or before March 23, two days before the state issued its advisory. One week before the state's advisory was released, the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Report looked at a facility in Washington State. The report’s authors recommended that ""in the context of rapidly escalating COVID-19 outbreaks in much of the United States, it is critical that long-term care facilities implement active measures to prevent introduction of COVID-19."" The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal regulator of nursing homes known as CMS, also issued COVID-19 guidance. The top administrator at CMS, Seema Verma, pushed back on Cuomo’s claim that the state followed federal guidance. She  cited a March 13 CMS document, which says that nursing homes should only accept those patients for which they can care. The CMS memo also states: ""Per CDC, prompt detection, triage and isolation of potentially infectious residents are essential to prevent unnecessary exposures among residents, healthcare personnel, and visitors at the facility. Therefore, facilities should continue to be vigilant in identifying any possible infected individuals."" It was a week after the Cuomo order, on April 2, that the CMS said new long-term care patients and residents ""should be screened for COVID-19 through testing, if available."" CMS guidance also states that if possible, nursing homes should dedicate a unit or wing exclusively to residents returning from the hospital, where they can remain for 14 days without symptoms. The state was clear about why it issued its March 25 advisory to nursing home administrators, directors of nursing and hospital discharge planners: There was an ""urgent need"" to free up space in hospitals for seriously ill coronavirus patients. The advisory said all nursing homes ""must comply with the expedited receipt of residents returning from hospitals to"" nursing homes, and that hospitals must declare residents medically stable before they are sent back to the nursing homes. The next directive, where ""NH"" is ""nursing home"" (emphasis by the Department of Health): ""No resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. NHs are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission."" It also stated: ""As always, standard precautions must be maintained, and environmental cleaning made a priority, during this public health emergency."" In other communications in March, the state told nursing homes to isolate infected residents in their rooms or to consider grouping them in a dedicated unit, as well as to stay current with CDC guidelines in preventing the spread of the disease. To support Cuomo’s claim, the administration pointed us to longstanding state and federal regulations that predate the pandemic, which require nursing homes to only accept patients for which they can care. ""This is business in a nursing home: Take them if you can care for them,"" said state Department of Health spokesperson Gary Holmes. Holmes also pointed us to the March 13 CMS memo, which states that when a resident who was diagnosed with COVID-19 is coming from a hospital, nursing homes ""can accept"" them, as long as the facility can follow CDC infection control measures. The CMS memo also states: ""Nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present."" Nursing homes felt pressure to accept coronavirus patients following the March 25 order. The AMDA-Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine issued a statement on March 26 opposing the order: ""We find the New York State Advisory to be over-reaching, not consistent with science, unenforceable, and beyond all, not in the least consistent with patient safety principles."" A joint statement by that organization and others in long-term care three days later reinforced their objections: ""a blanket order for every nursing home in the state to accept all admissions from hospitals is not sound policy."" On April 9, the head of a Brooklyn nursing home asked state health officials if COVID-19 patients could be transfered to the Javits Center or the Navy hospital ship, and was denied permission, the Associated Press reported. In late April, when reporters questioned Cuomo about the directive that nursing homes accept coronavirus patients, Cuomo repeatedly said that nursing homes should find other beds for these patients if they cannot care for them, or turn to the state to do so. He also said that the facilities ""don’t have the right to object"" to the state’s policy. On April 23, State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said no nursing home had asked the state to take any patients it couldn’t handle. On April 29, after the state's policy had been under intense scrutiny, Zucker wrote a letter to nursing homes, telling them to alert the state if they have patients for which they cannot care. In recent weeks, three facilities have asked the state for help, Holmes said. The March 25 advisory has been removed from the state website, and the state’s directive to nursing homes is now much different. Cuomo issued an executive order on May 10, which states that hospitals ""shall not discharge a patient to a nursing home, unless the nursing home operator or administrator has first certified that it is able to properly care for such a patient."" The order also requires that a patient must be tested for COVID-19, and the test must be negative. Though the state's actions have been criticized, it’s unclear what was the biggest source of infection in nursing homes, whether it was incoming residents, or health care workers and visitors unaware they had the virus. The CDC's guidance at the time of the March 25 state order was that COVID-19 patients who are medically stable can be discharged from a hospital to a nursing home, but only if the nursing home can implement all recommended infection control procedures. CMS, a federal agency that regulates nursing homes, issued similar guidance, and also said that preferably, coronoavirus patients should be cared for in a dedicated unit. Like CDC and CMS, the state Health Department said only those patients who are medically stable can be discharged, and also recommended that nursing homes consider dedicated units, if possible. The Health Department prohibited nursing homes from requiring a COVID-19 test before admitting a resident, while CMS said new residents should be tested, but did not require it. The Cuomo administration points to state and federal regulations that predate the pandemic, which require facilities to accept only those patients they can care for. In addition, earlier state communications encouraged nursing homes to stay current with CDC guidance. But once the state issued its March 25 advisory, nursing home operators said that they felt they had no choice but to accept residents who were either known to be infected or suspected to be. That’s because the March 25 memo did not say anything about making sure that a nursing home can care for a patient before making an admission decision, and said they ""must comply with the expedited receipt of residents."" In the month following the memo, nursing homes pleaded for relief from the order.",false,"Public Health, New York, Coronavirus, Andrew Cuomo, "
454,13622,"The Obama administration gave Iran ""$400 million in ransom payment cash.","August 24, 2016","Trump said the Obama administration gave Iran ""$400 million in ransom payment cash."" On the same day in January, the United States paid Iran $400 million dollars, and Iran released several American prisoners. While there appears to be a quid pro quo — the United States would not give Iran the cash until the prisoners were on their way home — this does not equate to ransom, experts told us. Iran had a legitimate claim to the money, as the United States owed it to Iran as part of a resolution to a decades-long financial dispute. It’s unclear whether the prisoner and financial disputes were connected in just the final hours of the prisoner transfer or if there was more advance coordination. Trump’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",Lauren Carroll,"Back in January, Iran released five American prisoners back to the United States. On the same day, the United States transferred $400 million in cash to Iran, holding onto the money until three of the freed Americans were in the air, on their way home. Some critics of President Barack Obama’s foreign policy -- including Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump -- are putting the two happenings together and calling it a ""ransom"" payment. The administration denies that characterization. ""Iran, the world's top state sponsor of terrorism, has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, was given $400 million in ransom payment cash, where they just yesterday caught Obama in yet another lie,"" Trump said in an Aug. 21 speech in Michigan. While some in the national security community might consider the transaction unsavory, ineffectual, or legally questionable, calling it ""ransom"" isn’t quite accurate. The word ""ransom"" implies that Iran refused to release the prisoners unless the United States turned over $400 million of its own money to Iran, and American officials capitulated. In reality, the United States owed Iran $400 million as part of a longstanding dispute, and negotiators used that pending settlement as leverage to release the detained Americans. Experts said this kind of exchange is standard issue in U.S.-Iran relations over the past few decades. The important but subtle nuance is this: While settling the $400 million helped ensure that the prisoners got home, it wasn’t an illicit payment. Iran, according to the claim adjudicators, had a legitimate right to the money. ‘Business as usual’ In 1979, Iran’s then-monarch Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi paid $400 million to the United States government to purchase military parts. But that year’s revolution toppled the shah, and the military parts were never delivered. To regain its funds, Iran filed a claim against the United States in 1981 in the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, which adjudicates disputes between the two nations. The body, located at the Hague, was established amid negotiations to end the 1979-81 Iran hostage crisis, in which pro-revolution students took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The tribunal's first priority was to address claims from private individuals, including 4,700 now-resolved U.S. claims filed against the Government of Iran. Over the past several years, the tribunal has focused more of its attention on claims the two governments have made against each other, including this dispute over the $400 million weapons deal. The State Department announced its settlement in the dispute — the United States would pay Iran $400 million plus $1.3 billion in interest — on Jan. 17, the same day Obama announced the return of the Americans detained in Iran, as well as the formal implementation of the nuclear deal. The first installment of the settlement was also transferred that day, via an unmarked cargo plane, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal in early August. The administration paid the funds using various European currencies because U.S. law bars financial transactions with Iran in U.S. dollars, and Iran’s access to banking is limited because of international sanctions. The administration has explained that the $400 million settlement and the prisoner release were negotiated in separate channels and coincidentally reached their resolutions near the same time. Negotiators took advantage of the convergence in order to ensure that Iran returned the prisoners by withholding the payment until the American detainees were in the air and headed out of Iran. ""While there is no connection between the $400 million and the return of our American citizens, we did, however, in those endgame hours, hold back that payment until we knew that our Americans were safe and sound and on their way out of Iran, because, in the very last few hours, Iran was playing a few games here on us,"" said State Department spokesman John Kirby in an Aug. 19 PBS interview. We may never truly know how intertwined these two negotiation channels were, but two experts personally familiar with the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal told us that the administration’s explanation is plausible. ""As for the timing of this particular settlement, the Obama administration’s account is entirely consistent with my experience,"" said Nancy Combs, who was a legal adviser to the tribunal until becoming a professor at William and Mary Law School in 2004. Combs said this particular claim was massive in size, complexity and value, so it is likely that lawyers had been working on this case prior to and separate from the prisoner issue, as well as the nuclear deal talks. Given that these cases are hashed out by career lawyers over many years, it’s likely that the lawyers approached the administration with the news that they were in a position to settle, as opposed to the administration directing them to settle, said John Bellinger, who served as the State Department’s chief legal adviser under President George W. Bush. (Bellinger has publicly opposed Trump.) ""I suspect that these two negotiations, the claims settlement and detained persons, were completely separate and happened to come together at the same time,"" Bellinger added. ""I don’t think it’s appropriate to call this ransom, and the intent of the money was not to gain the return of these detainees."" We should note that some have pointed out an article Bellinger wrote for the Washington Post in 2009, in which he seemed to say the tribunal had already dismissed this claim. Bellinger told us that it is his understanding that the January 2016 settlement involved a different dispute. We talked to five people who study national security and Iran. The only one willing to call the payment ""ransom"" was Clare Lopez,  vice president for research and analysis at the Center for Security Policy, a right-leaning think tank. Lopez has called the broader Iran deal unconstitutional and has written for conservative websites. ""There's simply no other way to call an unmarked cargo plane delivery of pallets of shrink-wrapped European currency in the middle of the night to the foremost state sponsor of terror in the world that remains under U.S. financial sanctions for terrorism,"" Lopez said. The majority of experts said the ransom label was inaccurate. ""In no sense can this payment be considered ransom,"" Combs said. ""A ransom is a payment made to secure the release of a detained person. This sum, by contrast, was made to satisfy a legitimate debt that the U.S. owed to Iran."" Gary Samore, executive director for research at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and a former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction under Obama, said it's not ""technically ransom in that the money that was returned was Iran’s money."" Samore said he was not surprised by the exchange because there’s a history of using financial tools to settle deals with Iran. He specifically noted that in 2011, the nation of Oman paid Iran $1 million on the United States’ behalf for the release of two American hikers who had been jailed in Iran for two years. ""It’s business as usual,"" he said. ""I don’t think the Iranians are going to release prisoners if they don’t get something."" Our ruling Trump said the Obama administration gave Iran ""$400 million in ransom payment cash."" On the same day in January, the United States paid Iran $400 million dollars, and Iran released several American prisoners. While there appears to be a quid pro quo — the United States would not give Iran the cash until the prisoners were on their way home — this does not equate to ransom, experts told us.

455,19371,"Obamacare will provide coverage for abortions, despite the president’s commitment that it would not.","September 24, 2012","Karen Handel lays out case against Obama, others in new book",Eric Stirgus,"In her new book, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel said she was the target of a left-wing conspiracy that cost Handel her job last year at Susan G. Komen for the Cure, one of the nation’s leading breast cancer prevention organizations. The main conspirators, Handel wrote, were top officials at Planned Parenthood, who blamed her for Komen’s plans to end funding to their organization. She also claimed the White House was a co-conspirator for a few reasons, such as Handel’s claim that Planned Parenthood’s political arm is a major fundraising source for the Democratic Party. The book, ""Planned Bullyhood,"" lays out Handel’s case, including a claim PolitiFact Georgia found interesting. Handel wrote that Planned Parenthood will receive millions of dollars in grants under the federal government’s health care law, which conservatives derisively call ""Obamacare."" ""[M]ost disturbing, is the fact that Obamacare will provide coverage for abortions, despite the president’s commitment that it would not,"" Handel, a Republican, wrote on page 161 of the book. ""Under a rule issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, insurance plans within the state health exchanges are required to cover abortions,"" wrote Handel, the former chairwoman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, who narrowly lost the GOP gubernatorial runoff in 2010. Handel resigned her position as vice president of policy at Komen earlier this year. Handel’s statement contained two claims we wanted to fact-check: Does the health care law provide a means for coverage for abortions, and does the law provide such coverage despite President Barack Obama’s commitment that it would not? Handel surrogates sent us several documents to support her claim. A National Right to Life official also sent us materials on her behalf to argue her statement is accurate. ""I think the gist of what she’s saying is correct,"" said Douglas Johnson, the Washington-based organization’s legislative director. A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services weblink, though, contradicts Handel’s claim that the law provides coverage for abortions. It says the health care law does not pay for abortions, citing a decades-old federal policy called the Hyde Amendment. Obama signed an executive order in the health care law including language from the amendment stating ""federal funds are not used for abortion services [except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered]."" If a state chooses to, it can use its own funds to cover abortions in certain other circumstances, and states will continue to have this option under the health care law. The health care law creates exchanges: new organizations designed to create a more organized and competitive market for buying health insurance. Starting in 2014, exchanges will serve primarily individuals buying insurance on their own and small businesses with up to 100 employees, though states can choose to include larger employers in the future. So, can women get abortions through the exchanges? It depends. State governments can restrict insurance coverage for abortion in the health care exchanges. Some states have already made plans to do so. ""That’s about the only positive thing that came out of [the health care law],"" Johnson said. If the state does not bar coverage of abortions, private insurers can offer a plan that covers abortions beyond the federal limitations within an exchange. No private insurer will be forced to cover abortion, our partners at PolitiFact have noted. The health care law outlines a methodology for states to follow to ensure that no federal funds are used toward coverage for abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment. Any plan that covers abortions beyond Hyde limitations must estimate the actuarial value of such coverage by taking into account the cost of the abortion benefit (valued at $1 or more per enrollee per month). ""Before choosing a health plan, consumers will know whether the plan covers these services,"" Erin Shields, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, was quoted as saying in The Huffington Post. ""And if it does, payments will be made into a separate account to ensure no federal dollars fund these services."" Handel has a different description of how this works. ""The new rule requires that an individual enrolled in one of these plans pay a separate fee of at least one dollar — an abortion surcharge. The abortion surcharge is paid directly to the abortion fund, going to an account that is separate from the monthly insurance premium. Why two separate accounts? It’s the Obama administration’s cunning and deceptive way to circumvent the prohibition of federal funds going to abortion — and no doubt, Planned Parenthood,"" she wrote. Johnson said he and other organizations agree with Handel’s interpretation of this funding provision. As for whether the president had committed to prohibiting abortion coverage in the health care law, that part is clearer. PolitiFact reported that Obama told some conservative Democrats in Congress uneasy about voting for the health care law ""there will be no public funding of abortion in this legislation."" He also signed an executive order on March 24, 2010, that ""federal funds are not used for abortion services [except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered]."" Several leading abortion rights organizations were disappointed with the plan to include the Hyde Amendment into the health care law. Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, put out a statement opposing the deal. ""Planned Parenthood strongly opposes the new abortion language offered by Senator Ben Nelson in the manager's amendment,"" she said. ""[I]t is a sad day when women’s health is traded away for one vote."" Obama did say and signed an executive order that committed to no federal funding for abortion in the health care law. Handel’s claim that the law will provide coverage for abortions could have been made more precisely. States can bar all plans participating in the state exchanges from covering abortions. That’s not mentioned in Handel’s book. Basically, abortions can be performed under the health care law, depending on which state you reside in. Because that bit of detail was not mentioned.",true,"Abortion, Georgia, Karen Handel, "

458,28049,A couple sued Planned Parenthood for child support over a failed abortion.,"March 1, 2019","What's true: A couple sued Planned Parenthood over a failed abortion that resulted in the birth of a third child. What's false: The lawsuit was not a child support claim, but rather one seeking compensatory damages.",Bethania Palma,"On 11 February 2019, Bianca Coons and Christopher Ruiz of Idaho filed a lawsuit in Albuquerque, New Mexico, against Planned Parenthood over a failed abortion that resulted in the birth of a baby boy. According to court documents, the couple, who were already parents to two small children, cited “extreme poverty” as a reason for their seeking a “medically assisted” (or non-surgical) abortion in an effort to limit the size of their family. The story was soon picked up by a number of partisan websites such as LifeSiteNews, who reported the story in emotional terms: Imagine the following scenario. You are a happy boy, growing up in a middle-class home with your two siblings. You enjoy playing outdoors with them, school is going well, and you think the world of your parents. Your dad is your hero, and you love your mom more than anyone in the world. But one day, you Google your family’s name for a school assignment. Your teacher has assigned the class a project that has each student researching their family tree. And that is when you discover a series of news articles that appear to discuss your family. It seems a man and a woman with the same names as your father and your mother sued an abortion clinic after giving birth to a baby they had tried, unsuccessfully, to abort. The articles mention that there were already two children in the family, and it was the third baby they had tried to get rid of. With horror, you try to fight off an inescapable realization: You are the third and youngest child. These hypothetical details may have inspired some readers to question whether the underlying event itself was true, and a review of court documents shows that Coons and Ruiz did indeed file suit against Planned Parenthood for damages over a failed abortion that resulted in the birth of their third child. According to the lawsuit filed in New Mexico, the couple felt they could not afford to add another child to their family, so on 12 February 2016, when Coons was about five or six weeks pregnant, they traveled from their home in Idaho to a Planned Parenthood clinic in Albuquerque in hopes that an abortion procedure could be performed quickly before the fetus developed any further. The couple made the journey, court records said, in order to avoid a state-mandated waiting period. (In Idaho, a woman must wait 24 hours after receiving “state-directed counseling that includes information designed to discourage her from having an abortion” before undergoing the procedure.) Coons wanted the procedure done expeditiously before the fetus developed any further. Coons and her family used “all economic resources available to them at the time to pay the $400 fee for the abortion and make the trip,” according to court documents. She took the first pill in the two-pill regimen at Planned Parenthood, was given instruction for “further oral administration,” and then returned home to Boise. The next day Coons visited a hospital emergency room complaining of nausea and dizziness. She was treated for dehydration, and medical staff there told her that her fetus had a strong heartbeat. The doctor caring for her called the Albuquerque clinic asking whether she should continue with the second abortion pill and received an affirmative answer. According to court documents, even after taking both doses of the abortion-inducing drugs, Coons was still pregnant with a viable fetus, but she didn’t have the financial means to pay for another procedure in Idaho or return to New Mexico to follow up with the clinic that gave her the medication. Coons contacted the Planned Parenthood facility in Albuquerque in early March 2016 to inform them she was still pregnant, but by that time she felt morally opposed to continuing the effort to undergo an abortion due to the more advanced stage of development of the fetus. The couple was notified that the abortion medication could result in birth defects, causing them to live with the fear their son could develop resulting health issues later in life. Coons gave birth to a premature baby boy who had jaundice and blood-sugar problems, according to court documents. Coons and Ruiz are suing for $765,000 in compensatory damages for alleged negligence and breach of contract, according to court documents. We reached out to Planned Parenthood for comment and have not received a response, but a spokesperson for the organization told the Albuquerque Journal they could not comment on pending litigation or discuss specific patients due to privacy concerns.",true,"Politics, planned parenthood"

Common Cause officials urge voters who encounter any problems on election day to call 866-OUR-VOTE to speak to trained volunteers or text the words “election protection” to 97779 for voting assistance. In SDR states like Wisconsin, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Iowa and Idaho, voters can register on the spot. Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Wyoming and Washington, D.C. also have same-day voter registration. North Dakota doesn’t have voter registration but it does have voter identification laws. “Wisconsin voters who are not on the poll list can register on election day. In Wisconsin, provisional ballots are used primarily for voters who do not have an acceptable photo identification,” said Reid Magney, public information officer for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Voters in Wisconsin have until 4 p.m. the Friday after the election to present their local election official with required identification in order for their vote to be counted. North Dakota voters without required identification who cast provisional ballots must present an acceptable form of identification to local election officials within six days in order for their votes to be counted. Sen. Heidi Hietkamp also introduced a bill that would, among other things, enable voting precincts to treat the state’s large minority Native American residents’ tribal ID cards like state and local-issued forms of identification for purposes of voting. Provisional ballot voting has gotten wide attention because of highly-publicized cases in which state officials have either purged voter roles and/or enacted legislation that critics fear will disenfranchise minority communities. In Georgia, a 2017 “exact match” law allowed the registration of voters to be suspended and then cancelled if the information on their government-issued identification varied even slightly from the information on their voter registration forms. According to court documents, “Under this ‘exact match’ protocol, the transposition of a single letter or number, deletion or addition of a hyphen or apostrophe, the accidental entry of an extra character or space, and the use of a familiar name like “Tom” instead of ‘Thomas’ will cause a no match result.” And the burden of rectifying the issue falls on voters. Georgia secretary of state and gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp is currently being sued by a coalition of civil rights groups who claim the “exact match” law has hampered the registration of 51,111 voters, 80.15% of whom are black, Latino, or Asian, and some critics have called on Kemp to resign. Also in 2017, Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson dropped roughly half a million entries from voter registries in what she called an effort to clean up an outdated list. In June 2018, a federal court blocked the state from implementing a 2017 law that would have allowed election officials to cancel registrations without notice if voters’ names appeared on an interstate database meant to flag potential double voting. The database, Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck, has been criticized as being unreliable, while the court ruled the Indiana law violated federal law. Indiana officials have been accused of violating that court order and did not respond to our questions about it. In North Dakota, the U.S. Supreme Court on 9 October 2018 let stand a state law requiring voters to present identification listing their residential addresses. Because many among the state’s large Native American minority use post office (P.O.) boxes and not street addresses on reservations, the Supreme Court decision that allowing the voter ID requirements to remain in place through the November 2018 election has caused many to fear that tribal members will be collectively disenfranchised on election day.",true,"Politics, 2018 election, voter purge"

""Please make no mistake -- we are in the midst of an epidemic of Alzheimer’s disease,"" Rosemary Laird, a geriatrician at the Centre for Senior Health in Winter Park, told the Senate Health Policy Committee on March 14. ""Currently, half a million Floridians have Alzheimer’s disease, and in less than 10 years, a 40 percent growth rate means that another 200,000 Floridians will develop this devastating illness."" Laird was testifying in favor of SB 1050, a bill sponsored by Sen. David Simmons, R-Longwood, to establish a memory disorder clinic at Florida Hospital in Orange County. Laird’s office did not return a call, but we were able to find statistics that closely matched what she told the committee. They were cited in ""2017 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures,"" a report by the Alzheimer’s Association, the leading advocacy group for patients with the severe memory-loss condition and their families and caregivers. The report, in Table 4, offers projections for state-by-state numbers of residents with Alzheimer’s in 2017 and 2025. For Florida, it lists 520,000 people with the disease in 2017 and 720,000 for 2025, a growth rate of 38.5 percent. Rounded off, those are essentially identical to the figures Laird cited. However, it’s worth noting that the table cites these figures as ""estimates"" (for 2017) and ""projected"" (for 2025). The numbers in the report are footnoted to a study published in the academic journal Neurology in May 2013. The authors used Alzheimer’s diagnosis statistics from 2010 to create estimates of how many cases would be expected in future years as far out as 2050. Given the margins of error in estimates and projections, and given the difficulty of diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease in patients, it’s a slight overreach for Laird to frame these as hard numbers of Floridians who have the disease today. They are a useful yardstick and were published in a respected scientific journal, but her phrasing suggests too high a degree of certainty about the numbers who have the disease today. ""It is accurate to say that the numbers are estimates, or as we put it in the report, ‘projections,’ "" said Laura Cilmi, a spokeswoman for the Alzheimer’s Association.

469,10862,"New Therapy Delivers Long-Term Relief for Chronic Back, Leg Pain, Study Finds","August 4, 2015","The release reports on a study that tested a new type of implanted device for the treatment of chronic back and leg pain. It uses high-frequency electrical pulses, delivered directly to the spinal cord via implanted leads. The study compared this high-frequency form of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) to a more traditional approach that uses lower-frequency pulses. The main advantage of the new approach, according to the release, is that patients don’t feel an annoying tingling or buzzing sensation that’s associated with the traditional approach. The release faithfully reports the outlines of the study in broad strokes and provides some of the outcomes in user-friendly terms. But there a lot of missing context that any reporter relying on the release should have been given. Notably, this was a company funded study run by investigators with close ties to the manufacturer of the device. The surgery required to implant the device can cause harms that weren’t mentioned. Finally, it’s not clear if this device is approved for use and if so, how much would it cost to have it implanted and would insurance cover that cost? Many people have chronic pain that isn’t satisfactorily addressed with existing approaches. If a new device can improve on those existing therapies as is claimed in this release, many people would be interested to know about it. But along with offering the good news about potential benefits, release writers have an obligation to provide context that cuts the other way — whether that’s possible harms from the device, conflicts of interest among the researchers, or limitations to the study design. They also owe it to readers to present a full array of potential alternatives. This release sets up what seems to be a false choice between SCS and either surgery or narcotics. Patient can also try yoga, exercise, NSAIDS, and behavioral modifications — treatments that can work and have little cost and risk.","Kevin Lomangino,James Rickert, MD,Gary Schwitzer","The news release doesn’t address the costs of newer, high-frequency SCS vs. traditional SCS. Since traditional SCS seems to be commonly used, it should be possible to provide some estimate of what the device and the implantation procedure cost. It would be nice if the release had also addressed potential insurance coverage for either device. The release does a good job of putting some numbers on the potential benefits. For example, the release gives us the absolute number of pain patients in each group who experienced a 50% or greater reduction in symptoms. “At three months, 85 percent of back pain and 83 percent of leg pain patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain or greater. Conversely, only 44 percent of back pain and 56 percent of leg pain patients in the traditional SCS group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain.” Of course, it’s worth noting that these are the findings after 3 months, and the study lasted for 12 months. However, it doesn’t look like the benefits were diminished too greatly with longer-term use of the device, so we’ll award a Satisfactory grade — even though it would have been preferable to also see the findings after a full year of use. The story doesn’t address harms except to note that the high-frequency group had no paresthesia. The study that’s the basis for the release noted that “non-serious” study-related adverse events occurred in about 30% of patients in both groups. These included implant site pain and lead migration resulting in “surgical revision” (i.e. a second operation). But that begs the question: How can a second surgery be considered “non-serious”? The release provides some details, noting that the researchers examined 171 patients with chronic back or leg pain who were implanted at 10 comprehensive pain treatment centers. We’re also told the study was the first long-term comparison of the two approaches. But the release skimps on some important information. On the one hand, the release never tells us that this was a randomized study — one of the strongest study designs for comparing the effectiveness of two treatments. But on the other, the release doesn’t acknowledge the fact that the study wasn’t blinded, which is a very serious limitation in a study to assess pain. The patients knew which treatment they were getting and the study researchers also knew which patients were getting high-frequency vs. traditional SCS. This knowledge has the potential to bias the results of the study. Moreover, the non-blinded researchers were free to change patient pain medicines as they saw fit, and neither the release nor the study gives data on these changes: this sort of thing is very likely to lead to spurious results. We’re not saying the release needed to go into detail on every possible limitation of this study, but readers need some sense that there are limitations and drawbacks to a study such as this. The release didn’t provide that context. The release succumbs to exaggeration, noting that “More than 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from chronic pain, with lower back pain being the most frequent condition affecting 23 to 26 percent of the population.” The release should’ve kept the discussion limited to back and leg pain and the specific kind of patients who would be candidates for this device — not every person in the world who suffers from chronic pain. By throwing out such numbers, the release takes on a promotional tone — as if its purpose is to increase interest in the procedure from anyone with chronic back pain. The release does not tell readers that the study was funded by the Nevro Corporation, which makes the device that was studied, nor that the study authors had ties to the company and other medical device makers. The release mentions traditional SCS, opioids, and back surgery as other approaches to back pain, and notes that they have “limited effectiveness and commonly known side effects.” But we don’t think this is enough for a Satisfactory grade here. The options for treatment of back pain are much more diverse than just surgery, narcotics, and an implanted spinal cord stimulator, and so in a sense the release is offering a false choice. Other less invasive components of multimodal pain management strategy include exercise, physical therapy, yoga, NSAIDS (e.g. ibuprofen), and behavioral counseling. It’s not clear from the release if this device is approved and available. It appears that it is. The release says, “This is the first long-term study to compare the safety and effectiveness of high frequency and traditional SCS therapy for back and leg pain.” Nothing over-the-top here. We’ve already commented on exaggeration in the Disease Mongering criterion above.",false,"Association/Society news release,Conflict of interest,medical devices"

The White House said he was referring to wind, solar and geothermal, which are three types of renewable resources promoted in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

Renewable resource advocates also agreed that the Recovery Act contributed to that growth. Obama didn’t mention, however, that so-called ""clean energy"" still accounts for a sliver of U.S. energy production, which overwhelmingly relies on fossil fuels. Nor does it include other kinds of renewable energy, such as biomass and hydroelectric, which have remained relatively flat.",Joshua Gillin,"America’s recovery from the Great Recession is slow but steady, President Barack Obama said in a recent speech, and the country is headed in the right direction, thanks in part to his energy initiatives. He told students at Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville, Tenn., on Jan. 9, 2015, the United States is now the world’s No. 1 producer in oil and gas -- a statement we’ve researched in the past and rated True -- and touted a move to more renewable resources. ""We’ve doubled the production of clean energy,"" Obama told the crowd. There was no time frame given or any indication of what he considered clean energy, but PolitiFact wondered whether that was true. And if it was, could he take credit for it? Generating interest The White House specified Obama was referring to solar, wind and geothermal (harnessing power from heat generated under the Earth’s crust), but omitted any specific time frame. We can go ahead and assume they mean since the beginning of Obama’s first term, but the definition of renewables needs some explaining. The U.S. Energy Information Administration considers renewable energy as coming from any source that is ""naturally replenishing but flow-limited,"" meaning there are limits on how much energy can be derived from the source at once. This also includes biomass fuels, like burning wood and solid waste, and hydroelectric power. States often don’t classify hydroelectric as renewable for several reasons, including substantial infrastructure requirements and the disruption of water ecosystems. Many states also don’t count hydroelectric in order to pressure utilities to increase renewable energy resources beyond existing hydroelectric facilities. It’s important to note that promoting renewable energy was a major focus of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed by the Democrat-controlled Congress in February 2009 to help spur the economy in the wake of the recession. Obama signed the bill, which contained some $90 billion for energy-related investment, reimbursements for installations, a reauthorized loan guarantee program and tax credits. One of the goals was to double renewable energy generation by 2012. Since the administration mentioned those three energy sources as their definition of ""clean energy,"" they are the ones we asked the Energy Information Administration about. Spokesperson John Cogan provided this information for the existing net summer capacity of energy production types in megawatts: Year Wind Solar, Thermal and Photovoltaic Geothermal Total 2007 16,515 502 2,214 19,231 2008 24,651 536 2,229 27,416 2009 34,296 619 2,382 37,297 2010 39,135 866 2,405 42,406 2011 45,676 1,524 2,409 49,609 2012 59,075 3,170 2,592 65,377 Now, don’t go thinking we’re all suddenly living emission-free and the specter of global warming due to greenhouse gases is a thing of the past. The country still uses fossil fuels like coal, petroleum and natural gas for most of its electricity needs, about 68 percent as of June 2014 (the EIA says wind, solar and geothermal generated less than 5 percent in that time frame, up from about 1.5 percent in 2008). Still, that’s a marked decrease in fossil fuel use, which was around 85 percent in 2008. Also, we can’t completely ignore hydroelectric and biomass sources. Those sources are considered renewable even if they weren’t named by the White House, but their use has not doubled since 2008. Both have remained basically flat in that time period. So can Obama take credit for this spike in renewable energy resource use? Joseph Aldy, former special assistant to the president for energy and environment in 2009-10 and currently an assistant public policy professor at Harvard, says yes, arguing the combination of tax credits, grants and guaranteed loans for renewable energy projects helped boost providers through tight credit and labor markets. Current production far exceeds Energy Information Administration projections from 2009, he told PolitiFact. Susan Glickman, the Florida director of the pro-renewables Southern Alliance for Clean Energy said some expansion would have happened anyway, since costs have gone down, particularly for wind and solar. But not only did the Recovery Act spur growth for renewable energy, the residual effects have continued. The 2013 National Renewable Energy Laboratory report bears out these growth trends, which have been fueled by federal incentives, she said. Our ruling Obama said, ""we’ve doubled the production of clean energy.""

AMD, which occurs when the macula is unable to function properly, is a common cause of sight loss. David Hambleton, head of the South Tyneside CCG, said the policy of using Avastin rather than Bayer’s Eylea or Novartis’s Lucentis could save the regional National Health Service (NHS) 13.5 million pounds ($18 million) a year. “Clinical safety and effectiveness are paramount but, as the legal guardians of finite NHS resources, we commissioners also have a duty to act efficiently, effectively, and economically,” he wrote in the British Medical Journal on Wednesday. “This is one choice that is morally, ethically palatable.”  Across England, savings from using Avastin could total more than 500 million pounds, the journal reported. The new policy from the North East and North Cumbria CCG Forum means doctors will tell patients that Avastin is the preferred choice, although they are still free to choose Eylea or Lucentis if they want. However, doctors prescribing Avastin for AMD will be using the medicine “off label”, which goes against guidance from the General Medical Council that a licensed product should be used when available. While Avastin works in a similar way to Eylea and Lucentis, for a fraction of the price, Bayer and Novartis said it had not undergone the same rigorous regulatory scrutiny for use in AMD as their products. “Bayer feels it has to act to challenge the decision taken by these CCGs. Bayer is currently considering its position including the possibility of legal proceedings,” the German company said in an emailed statement. Novartis said the move was “not in line with the current UK and EU legal and regulatory framework”. The issue of whether Avastin should be used as a cheap alternative in AMD has long been controversial in Europe. In 2014 in Italy, Roche and Novartis were accused of collusion in trying to impose the use of Lucentis in AMD - a charge the two companies denied.",true,Health News

In a Sept. 8 TV commercial, the incumbent touts her record of overseeing the demise of rampant prescription drug abuse enabled by Florida doctors. ""With our amazing law enforcement, we closed down the pill mills,"" Bondi said. ""Of the top 100 oxycodone-­dispensing doctors in this country, 98 of them lived in Florida. Today, there are none."" That statistic implies Bondi was tough on crime, but PolitiFact Florida wanted to know if it was accurate. Closing the clinics The pill mill epidemic was a nationwide problem in 2010, driven by doctors who would write prescriptions and sell drugs out of clinics they owned themselves. Florida’s lax laws gave the Sunshine State a reputation for easy access to the drug, so much so that billboards advertised to ""narco tourists"" -- buyers from out of state who would come to Florida to buy the drug. With more than 1,000 pain clinics in operation across the state, Florida became known as the ""Oxy Express."" Bondi, who was elected in 2010, was a staunch supporter of HB 7095, a 2011 law that increased penalties for doctors who abused prescription privileges, banned them from prescribing drugs like oxycodone and strengthened state regulatory power over prescription pill trafficking. The bill passed both houses of the Legislature unanimously on May 6, 2011, and was signed by Gov. Rick Scott on June 3, 2011. Bondi’s camp told PolitiFact Florida the stat in the commercial came from the Statewide Task Force on Prescription Drug Abuse & Newborns 2014 Progress Report, which specifically dealt with the effects of opiate abuse by pregnant women on their children. The report credited changes in Florida law that shut down many clinics. ""In 2010, 98 of the top 100 oxycodone pill dispensing physicians nationally resided in Florida,"" the report read. ""In 2011, after the passage of HB 7095, only 13 of the top 100 resided in Florida, and by the end of 2012, not one Florida doctor appeared on the top 100 list."" The report, which used figures that also were widely reported by the media, cited U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration data accessed January 2013. Bondi’s office also gave us a DEA press release from April 5, 2013, to back up that claim -- although that release said ""90 of the top 100 oxycodone purchasing physicians in the nation were located in Florida."" When we asked the attorney general’s office why there was a discrepancy in the numbers, they insisted the number was 98. The DEA stood firm, however: In 2010, the number was 90 of the top 100 oxycodone-purchasing doctors. The federal agency also told us the number of doctors in Florida in 2011, after HB 7095 passed, was down to 10 and not 13. But wait, Bondi’s commercial says ""oxycodone-dispensing doctors,"" not ""purchasing,"" as the DEA measured in 2010. That’s because the 2011 law no longer allowed physicians to simply buy the drug to resell, DEA public information officer Mia Ro told PolitiFact Florida. ""When the Florida law changed, it prevented physicians from dispensing pills out of their clinics,"" Ro said. The agency doesn’t track ""what’s filled or prescribed,"" she said. That means the DEA numbers weren’t tracking whether or not actual abuse had happened, just that Florida doctors were buying lots of oxycodone. Some physicians are still allowed to buy hydrocodone in large quantities, Ro said -- emergency room personnel, for example -- but private doctors could no longer buy the drug and sell it on their own. There was one unnamed DEA registrant from Florida who was in the top 100 oxycodone buyers in 2014, Ro said: A purchaser for a fleet of cruise ships, to use the drug in the fleet’s sick bays. That’s not to say pill mills weren’t a problem, or that the 2011 law didn’t make a difference. By the time HB 7095 was enacted, it was estimated as many as 11 people per day were dying from prescription drug abuse. From 2010 to 2012, overdose deaths from prescription drugs, illicit drugs and alcohol dropped nearly 17 percent, and overall prescription drug fatalities fell 23 percent, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. About 52 percent of that decrease was in deaths from oxycodone. Our ruling Bondi said that of the top 100 oxycodone-dispensing doctors, 98 were in Florida, and ""today, there are none.""

479,644,Climate change endangers Scotland's archaeological treasures.,"March 17, 2015","Ancient British structures older than the pyramids are being threatened by climate change, experts have warned, as rising sea levels, heavier rainfall and severe weather events endanger Scotland’s archaeological treasures.",George Sargent,"The Orkney Islands, situated off the north coast of the Scottish mainland, are home to more than 3,000 historical sites. Evidence has been found of human habitation there going back 8,500 years. Some buildings on the islands date to the Iron Age, Viking rule and medieval times. But around 1,000 sites are situated on the coastline and are under threat. One such site is the Iron Age building South Howe Broch on the island of Rousay. Dating from between 600-400AD, the sea has taken much of the site’s western area. Now the broch wall itself is falling into the sea. Julie Gibson, a lecturer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, says it will eventually disappear. “What you can see just over here is the front door of the broch, exposed by the sea, taking away parts of the ruins and leaving a built wall still intact. And each year a little more falls as the sea batters it,” she said as she stood on the cliff’s edge. “What we have discovered in recent years, through the use of geophysics and other things, is that... on this stretch of the coastline, all the settlement archaeology is within 100 meters of the coast edge. And so as the sea takes this heritage of ours away it’s taking all that we have,” she said. A couple of hundred meters north of South Howe Broch is Midhowe Broch. This Iron Age building is well-preserved, courtesy of a sea wall built in the 1930s and well-maintained since. A spring-fed water tank, fireplace and room partitions are clearly visible. But even Midhowe Broch is at risk from climate change. A climate risk assessment of Orkney’s Neolithic sites, published by conservation public body Historic Environment Scotland (HES) in July this year, described the potential impact of climate change on the sites as “extreme” and their vulnerability as “high”. According to HES, average precipitation (rain, sleet and snow) has increased by 27% in Scotland since the early 1960s. In the same period, winter precipitation has gone up by more than 70% in parts of northern Scotland. Wetter weather means buildings are wetter for longer, meaning water is more likely to penetrate masonry and decay it. It also leads to metal parts of buildings corroding and the ground becoming unstable. This can lead to structural collapse. Sea levels are also rising and beach erosion is a growing problem. Since 1970 some Orkney beaches have narrowed by an average of 16 inches (40 centimeters) per year since 1970. That is compared to an annual average loss of eight inches between 1890 and 1970, according to data from cross-governmental coastal change assessment partnership Dynamic Coast. Increased storminess also threatens damaging Orkney’s historical sites, HES says. Arguably the most famous site of Orkney is Skara Brae. This Neolithic settlement, occupied from roughly 3100-2500BC, features a network of stone buildings. When inhabited it was approximately one kilometer (0.6 miles) from the sea with a freshwater loch and sand dunes in between. Now it sits only a few meters from the North Atlantic. Visitors can see the settlement’s 5,000-year-old hearths, bed recesses, cupboards and dressers. Some 112,000 people visited it in 2018. “Climate change is a really real present risk. The climate has already changed because of the influence of humans. And it’s going to continue to change and that pace of change is going to speed up,” said HES climate change scientist, David Harkin. “So the risk to sites like Skara Brae and other sites around Orkney, it’s real, it’s here, it’s happening. But it shouldn’t all be doom and gloom and despair. There is an opportunity to still do something about it and to avoid the worst possible consequences of climate change,” he added.",true,Environment
481,9688,School water coolers may help kids lose weight,"January 22, 2016","Despite it being a fairly short report, CBS covers a lot of ground: it quantifies the benefits in absolute terms, outlines the study design and weighs the advantages of modern water dispensers against “old-fashioned” water fountains. But in other areas, the story falls short. There is no mention of costs and of study limitations. Although it quotes from the accompanying JAMA Pediatrics editorial, the CBS story doesn’t feature any critical perspectives on the study. We would have liked a closer look at some of the study’s shortcomings, which could have been achieved by comments from an independent source, or someone who was not involved in the study. More context on where this study fits in “the growing body of evidence” would have also been welcome. Finally, word choice could have been better. CBS refers to the JAMA editorial and writes that “the study’s findings are significant.” However, “statistically significant” has a different meaning than what the public believes is “significant.” The distinction should be clear, or another word should be used. Childhood obesity is a health concern that is on the minds of many parents and policymakers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years. In 2012, more than one third of children and adolescents were overweight or obese, the CDC said. And compared to other countries around the world, the US comes out on top when it comes to obesity among adults, according to a 2014 OECD report. There are even speculations that high obesity rates may cause life expectancy in the US to decline. Therefore, any efforts to curb the “obesity epidemic” in America is newsworthy, especially if the intervention is low cost, low risk and for children.","Euna Bodner, MS,Yoni Freedhoff, MD,Kevin Lomangino","The CBS article does not mention any costs associated with the installation of a water dispenser. The JAMA Pediatrics article states that water jets are “relatively low-cost” interventions, with a one-time cost of about $1,000 per machine. There are also ongoing maintenance expenses, as well as additional costs for disposable cups. In addition, if the jets affect sales of milk and other beverages on school grounds, the costs would actually be higher still. We believe the water jet cost should have been covered in the story, since researchers in the original journal article emphasized the association between a “relatively low-cost water availability intervention and decreased student weight.” That’s why we give the CBS article an Not Satisfactory rating here. The CBS story does a good job quantifying the benefits in absolute terms, when the lead researcher points out that water dispensers were associated with “a one percentage point reduction in the likelihood of being overweight for boys and a little over half a percentage point reduction for girls.” The article translated this for readers as “a modest weight drop among students.” The piece also notes that water jets were linked with “a decrease” in the amount of half-pints of milk students bought, but it does not give any specific numbers. Specifically, researchers found a 12.3 decrease in the number of all types of milk purchased per student per year. We think the quantification of benefits in absolute terms is enough to merit a Satisfactory rating here. Students in New York City schools had access to water through drinking fountains before this intervention study. This study looked at a new way to deliver New York city tap water to kids, which may have encouraged them to opt for water instead of sugary beverages, like soda. We rate this one Not Applicable. The CBS story doesn’t mention any study limitations or take any sort of critical angle on the research. But in the original journal article, researchers point out some of the shortcomings of their data. For one, they only looked at administrative data on water jet delivery and did not directly observe water consumption in the cafeteria. They also used the same technique for milk purchases, and they acknowledged that they had no data on which beverages students usually consume in school. Since the CBS story doesn’t point out any limitations to the evidence, we give it an Not Satisfactory rating here. There is no disease mongering in the story. No conflicts of interests were reported in the original journal article. The study was funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The CBS report only quoted comments from the study’s lead researcher and then excerpts from the accompanying JAMA Pediatrics editorial. Technically, these editorial comments are sufficient to clear our bar, but we’d note that the thrust of the quote is mainly to confirm what the researchers are reporting. We would have liked to have seen a quote from someone willing to provide a more critical perspective on the study, such as the significance of its limitations and their impact on the research. While we give the benefit of the doubt here as we always do, the story didn’t really fulfill the spirit of this criterion. The story explains how water jets may be more effective than old-fashioned water fountains, due to concerns over water quality and fountain cleanliness. Drinking fountains also are less efficient at serving large numbers of children, the article adds. The availability of water dispensers is not in question. We would have liked to have seen a bit more context in the CBS story. Research looking at water availability is nothing new and has been conducted in the US and abroad – for example in Germany, researchers said. One US study found that water consumption nearly tripled after the installation of water jets, while the German study saw a decreased risk for students being overweight if more water was available in the classroom. However, the CBS article does quote the JAMA editorial, which pointed out this study “adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the importance of providing drinking water access in schools.” We think that’s good enough for a Satisfactory rating. The article does not rely on any news releases we found online. There is also evidence of original reporting in the lead researcher’s second comment, as he “told CBS News.”",true,weight loss
484,16759,North Korea is telling its people that their men’s national team is in the World Cup final.,"July 17, 2014","Bloggers said that North Korea was telling its people that the national team was in the World Cup final. The video was satire and bore unmistakable markings, for any Korean speaker, of having not come from the communist country. Plus, North Korea had been broadcasting the World Cup and any soccer fan there would know that their team failed to qualify.",Jon Greenberg,"Germany may have won the 2014 World Cup, but the tournament featuring soccer’s best has left the anonymous producer of the YouTube channel Korea News Backup with good reason to pop the champagne. Its mock video of a North Korean news broadcast previewing the final match has garnered over 8 million views. The video’s charm? It appears to tell North Koreans that their team made it to the final and will face the powerhouse team from Portugal. We at PunditFact took an interest because bloggers, and maybe even some journalists, thought North Korea was actually trying to put one over on its citizens. We want to be clear: The video is a fake. But a writer for the blog Outside the Beltway posted, ""North Korea is telling its people that their men’s national team is in the World Cup final."" The bulk of the post is a copy and paste from an article on the British website, Metro: ""We’ve known for a long time now that supreme leader Kim Jong-un controls the flow of information to his people, with the television channels only reporting positive stuff about the country. ""But in a report posted on YouTube, the media have been caught broadcasting that North Korea are on course to win the biggest prize in football, despite not actually qualifying for the World Cup. ""The report says North Korea’s brave side crushed Japan 7-0, USA 4-0 and China 2-0 in the group stages, before going on to reach the final… against Portugal. ""Of course, the real final, which takes place this Sunday, is between Germany and Argentina."" The Outside the Beltway blogger observes at the end, ""This is yet another example of just how pervasive the Kim dictatorship is, and just how hard it will likely be to integrate this nation into the real world when that regime finally falls."" We emailed the blogger and didn’t hear back. Curiously, by the time other readers saw the Metro article he linked to, it said something quite different from the words he quoted. The second sentence was key. ""But in a brilliant spoof report posted on YouTube, the media appears to be caught broadcasting that North Korea are on course to win the biggest prize in football, despite not actually qualifying for the World Cup,"" the Metro article said. We emailed the Metro sports writer to see if the article had been changed from the original but again, no word back. So it’s possible that that sports writer had also been pulled in, but we can’t say. From the comments on the Outside the Beltway blog, it is clear that while most readers doubted the newscast’s authenticity, others were ready to believe that the North Korean propaganda machine was aiming for a personal best in the disinformation category. A dose of reality There are several reasons the North Korean government would be unlikely to try such a stunt. For one, state-controlled media had been broadcasting the games, although not live. Also, most North Koreans would likely know that about two years ago, their team failed to qualify for the World Cup. It ranks 137 in the FIFA world rankings; only 32 countries get to compete. Soccer stat maven and professor of government at Cornell University Chris Anderson said ""making it to the final is basically impossible for North Korea on sporting grounds."" Stephen Epstein, a specialist in Korean culture and society at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, noted several elements in the video would instantly tell a trained viewer that it was a joke. ""As soon as I saw it, I knew what it was,"" Epstein said. ""The way the women was speaking, her accent, sounded like a South Korean broadcaster. Also she used the word ‘fighting’ (an English word brought over to South Korea). It clearly was not from the north."" In fact, Epstein said he thinks only people outside South Korea ""were suckered."" But he said that’s understandable. ""If you don’t have a real familiarity with North Korea and just know what Western media generally provides, this would fit with a preconceived stereotype,"" Epstein said. A mountain birth and a golf score It’s not as though North Korea doesn’t exercise creative license. According to the official biography of its previous leader Kim Jong Il, he was born on  Mount Baekdu, a sacred place in Korean culture. In reality, historians place his birth on Russian soil near Vladivostok where his father lived in a camp for Korean exiles. There’s also another sports myth, and this one is interesting because it has morphed over time. In 1994, the Agence France Presse news service said the golf pro at the Pyongyang golf course told a reporter with the Australian Financial Review that Kim Jong Il had scored 5 holes-in-one on his very first time on the links. ""He is an excellent golfer,"" the pro told the reporter. What’s notable about this factoid is that it was first ascribed to the golf pro alone, with no witnesses, as told to a named Australian reporter. By 2003, the New York Post had it at 11 holes-in-one. In 2011, the golf website Cybergolf.com had the 11, plus that the feat was witnessed by 17 security guards and ""dutifully reported to the North Korean masses by the state news agency."" With golf as with soccer, stories about North Korea seem to have the ability to take on a life of their own. Our ruling Bloggers said that North Korea was telling its people that the national team was in the World Cup final. The video was satire and bore unmistakable markings, for any Korean speaker, of having not come from the communist country.

485,14917,"The Chinese are there"" in Syria.","November 14, 2015","Carson said the Chinese have a presence in Syria. In context, Carson’s comments suggested a military presence. That claim appears to be lifted from unconfirmed blog posts and a news report by a Lebanese news site. China and the White House have denied that Chinese troops are in Syria, and experts told us there’s no evidence to the contrary. Even if Carson meant something less than a military presence, China seems to be taking a hands-off approach to the conflict in Syria.",Linda Qiu,"Ben Carson suggested during the Fox Business News debate in Milwaukee that China is involved in the Syrian conflict. When asked if he supports President Barack Obama’s decision to put 50 special operations troops in Syria, Carson said any presence is better than no presence, especially given the forces at play. Here’s what he said in context: Moderator Maria Bartiromo: ""Dr. Carson, you were against putting troops on the ground in Iraq and against a large military force in Afghanistan. Do you support the president’s decision to now put 50 special ops forces in Syria and leave 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan?"" Carson: ""Well, putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there, because they — that’s why they’re called special ops, they’re actually able to guide some of the other things that we’re doing there. ""And what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East. This is going to be his base. And we have to oppose him there in an effective way. ""We also must recognize that it’s a very complex place. You know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there."" We were curious about Carson’s assertion that the ""Chinese are there"" in Syria. According to the White House, China and experts, they are not. But before we dive into that issue, let’s sort out some semantics. What Carson meant Multiple media outlets, including our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker, took Carson’s remarks to mean that Chinese troops are in Syria. But the Carson camp forwarded us a statement refuting that interpretation. Rather, his actual point was that China is providing ""various military weapons and equipment that Syria is using in the current conflict,"" according to the statement which also included several links to articles on that point. ""Dr. Carson does not believe that China is currently fighting in or deploying troops to Syria, and contrary to press reports, he has never made that assertion,"" the statement reads. ""Regardless, Dr. Carson's claim that China is exerting its influence and has in the ongoing Syrian conflict is well-supported by evidence, even if it is not evidence commonly available to or easily accessible by journalists without the requisite language skills or knowledge about Chinese."" However, Carson seems to be backtracking. On Nov. 11, the day after the debate, a top Carson adviser spoke specifically about ""Chinese military advisers"" in Syria when defending Carson’s remarks. ""During Dr. Carson’s conversations with military operatives and people in Iraq, in that part of the world, (they) discussed with him multiple reports that Chinese military advisers are on the ground in Syria operating with Russia (sic) special-operations personnel,"" the adviser told Business Insider. A Carson spokesperson also referred the Washington Post’s Fact Checker to a few blog posts speculating explicitly about Chinese military personnel in Syra. We also ran Carson’s statement by an expert on political campaign rhetoric. ""Saying ‘the Chinese are there’ means the Chinese are there, not just that their weapons are there,"" said Kathleen Kendall, a communications professor at the University of Maryland. ""He is making a clear, firm assertion. Had he made a more nuanced statement, such as ‘there is a Chinese influence there,’ there would be some room for debate on his meaning."" No Chinese in Syria What’s the source of the idea that China is in Syria? The posts Carson’s spokesperson sent to the Washington Post all link back to a Sept. 27 report from the Lebanon-based news site Al-Masdar Al-’Arabi. According to the news site, a senior officer in the Syrian Arab Army said Chinese military personnel would join Russian marines in the Syria in the next six weeks. The story then got picked up by Russian state media, and the overseas media attention led China's Foreign Ministry to officially deny China’s presence in Syria in mid October, while its state-run media characterized the reports as ""speculative nonsense,"" according to Reuters. Carson’s statement also prompted responses from the White House. Press secretary Josh Earnest said he was ""speechless"" over Carson’s claim that he has better intelligence than the administration. ""I really can’t speak to what he was referring to, but unless you’re talking about having a diplomatic presence, I’m not sure what he was referencing,"" National Security Adviser Susan Rice said at a press conference. ""I have not seen evidence of Chinese military involvement in Syria."" Experts told us it would be very uncharacteristic for China — a country with a longstanding, though gradually changing policy of nonintervention — to send troops abroad, especially to the Middle East. ""The Chinese have been very, very clear from day one that Syria is not something they want to take responsibility for,"" said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, a global consulting firm. ""It would go against absolutely everything we know about China. And Syria is the world's worst morass. ... The Chinese want no part of this."" ""There is no possibility that China is planning on sending troops into Syria,"" said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""China doesn't send troops abroad except for peacekeeping purposes. China isn't interested in taking on the role of global policeman."" Both Bremmer and Glaser noted that official Chinese statements on Syria are vague comments promoting peace and self-rule. ""China opposes easy interference in other countries' domestic affairs. China supports Syria's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as well as its approach to find its own path of development that is consistent with its national circumstances,"" China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a visiting Syrian official in mid October. The same sentiment is expressed in a five-point proposal for the Syrian conflict put forward by China during the United Nations’ Geneva II peace conference in 2014, as well as the four-step initiative it offered at the Syria peace talks in Vienna at the end of October 2015. That came as news to Bremmer, who noted he’s not surprised that the neurosurgeon flubbed a statement about foreign policy. Is it possible that some Chinese officials are in Syria discreetly? ""There are 1.3 billion Chinese, they're in a lot of places. China’s got an economic interest in Syria obviously, so would I be stunned that there were a couple of Chinese intelligence guys on the ground? No, but they're not playing a military role,"" Bremmer said. Our ruling Carson said the Chinese have a presence in Syria. In context, Carson’s comments suggested a military presence. That claim appears to be lifted from unconfirmed blog posts and a news report by a Lebanese news site. China and the White House have denied that Chinese troops are in Syria, and experts told us there’s no evidence to the contrary.

According to local police, evidence gathered at the scene indicated  Dr. Sherlekar had taken his own life with an intentional overdose:  Frederick police said their review of evidence from Dr. Sandeep Sherlekar’s office in the American Spine Center indicated the 51-year-old took his own life, said Sgt. Andrew Alcorn, a Frederick police Criminal Investigations Division supervisor. “We are ready to officially call it a suicide and we’re confident that the medical examiner’s office will determine the manner of death was a suicide,” Alcorn said. “There was video inside the business that we reviewed that [shows] the doctor was alone at the time of his death and leading up to it, and he also left several notes.” Detectives believe Sherlekar died of an intentional overdose, based on evidence gathered and the lack of any sign of significant trauma to his body, Alcorn said. “We don’t know what’s involved in terms of the chemicals used, but it appears to be an overdose,” Alcorn said. “When the [medical examiner] gives us the toxicology reports back, we should know more.”  Although law enforcement authorities haven’t openly stated a motive for the doctor’s suicide, it was quite possibly linked to the fact that he and four other medical professionals had recently been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of agreeing to refer urine specimens to a testing lab for evaluation in return for $1.37 million in kickbacks, conspiring to defraud the IRS, health care fraud, and making false statements on patient medical records. Dr. Sherlekar’s death would likely have received little notice outside of Frederick had the conspiracy-mongering whatdoesitmean.com web site not used it as fodder for yet another “Sorcha Faal” report that weaves actual events into fabricated narratives of ominous political happenings:  Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of “reports” published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don’t think much of it. Each report resembles a news story in its style, but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality (e.g. “American Rebel Forces Attack Gas Pipelines, Explode Trains As US Civil War Nears”) and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service in the same article) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don’t contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish. In this case, WhatDoesItMean spun the doctor’s death into a fantasy story playing on rumors about Hillary Clinton’s supposedly concealed serious health issues, holding that Sherlekar had been part of a “specialized medical team” who secretly removed a blood clot from Hillary Clinton’s brain on 30 June 2016 — and then was killed (as part of the “Clinton body bags” scheme) to keep him from revealing what he knew about the presidential candidate’s medical condition:  A shocking new report circulating in the Kremlin today prepared by the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) says that the infamously named “Clinton Body Count” has now increased after a Maryland (US) based doctor was discovered dead under mysterious circumstances — and who had, this past June, been part of a specialized medical team that removed a blood clot from the brain of Hillary Clinton. According to this report, Hillary Clinton has long been known to have grave health issues since she collapsed in December, 2012, and that led to her first operation to remove a blood clot from her brain — and that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, recently stated took her 6 months to recover from. This past summer, however, this report continues, on 30 June, SVR analysts state that Hillary Clinton collapsed on her private plane while in route to her Washington D.C. home and was unconscious when it landed at Joint Base Andrews — which is the home base of the 89th Airlift Wing that manages the flights of all top American officials, including the President. Performing the emergency brain surgery on Hillary Clinton at the MedStar Montgomery Medical Center on 30 June, this report continues, was the Islamic neurosurgeon Amjad Anaizi who is her private brain doctor whom she frequently visits at the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital near her home in Washington D.C. — and who, also, is the cousin of Hillary Clinton’s top aid Huma Abedin who is linked to the Muslim Brotherhood terror organization. Attending Doctor Anaizi in his operating on Hillary Clinton’s brain to remove the blood clot that had rendered her unconscious, this report says, was Doctor Sandeep Sherlekar who was the on call anesthesiologist at MedStar Montgomery Medical Center — but who, exactly 3 months later, on 30 September, was discovered dead. Doctor Sandeep Sherlekar’s death fits exactly the profile of all of the other deaths associated with the Clinton Crime Family — with the victim fist “knowing to much”, then having “their personal and professional reputations destroyed”, with the final act being “their mysterious death” as a message for others to not dare cross these most dangerous of criminals. All of this was just another yarn that was, as usual, aggregated as a factual news report by a number of bottom-feeding web sites. Hillary Clinton underwent no emergency brain surgery on 30 June 2016: She attended a fundraising luncheon in San Francisco the day before, then returned to Washington, D.C. for a  2 July interview with the FBI regarding allegations that classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on a personal e-mail server she used while serving as Secretary of State.",false,"Junk News, hillary clinton, sorcha faal, whatdoesitmean.com"

Sanofi and Regeneron said they expect the lower-priced Praluent to be available for pharmacies to order in early March. They said the new price should improve patient access and result in lower out-of-pocket costs for U.S. consumers. Praluent and Repatha belong a class of injectable biotech drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart attacks and death. Sales of both have been severely constrained by onerous roadblocks to patient access put up by insurers looking to limit spending on the expensive drugs. They were approved in 2015 with initial list prices of more than $14,000 a year. In March of last year, Regeneron and Sanofi said that they would be willing to charge less for their drug if insurers agreed to reduce barriers for high-risk heart patients. A few months later they struck a deal with Express Scripts, now part of Cigna Corp, to make the drug available to that company’s customers at a price in the range of $4,500 to $6,600 a year. The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other developed countries, where governments directly or indirectly control costs. That makes it by far the world’s most lucrative market for manufacturers. Congress has been targeting the pharmaceutical industry over the rising cost of prescription drugs for U.S. consumers, particularly since Democrats took over the House of Representatives in January. Executives from at least six drugmakers plan to testify at a Senate hearing on rising prescription drug prices later this month.

490,10900,Botox may prevent irregular heartbeat after bypass surgery,"October 31, 2015","This concise (393 word) news release from the American Heart Association on a trial that used botulinum toxin to prevent irregular heart rhythms after bypass surgery packs a lot of good information into a small frame. The novel use of botulinum toxin represented in the story is an interesting and potentially important step toward a possible solution. As noted, the research was conducted in a small sample of 60 patients and although the results are impressive, they should be viewed with an understanding that many other potential therapies have failed on subsequent examination. The news release is written in a clear and measured way, although a clarification on the type of botulinum toxin used and the potential costs would have been helpful for reporters and the public. Atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass surgery is a vexing problem. Most patients who develop atrial fibrillation post-procedure do so within a few days of the procedure so an intraoperative or preoperative solution seems reasonable.Atrial fibrillation can cause serious complications for the patient undergoing heart bypass, extend their stay in the hospital, and substantially drive up the costs of the heart treatment.","Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Ishani Ganguli, MD, MPH,Kathlyn Stone","The story rightly points out that the development of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery has significant financial implications: “Atrial fibrillation is also always associated with lengthened hospitalization and that means increased healthcare costs.” But we would have liked to have seen some attention paid to the cost of the intervention, namely multiple injections of botulinum toxin. We calculate the cost of one 4mls vial of Xeomin (incobotulinumtoxinA) to be approximately $1000. This cost is likely to be rather small in comparison to the cost of extended hospitalizations, antiarrhythmic therapies and lost productivity from atrial fibrillation. The story does a good job in detailing the results of the study and the apparent benefit of botulinum toxin injections in this small sample randomized study. Researchers found that: The story appropriately points out that there were no additional harms seen in the group injected with the botulinum toxin compared to those who received saline other than those associated with the surgery. “No complications from the Botox injections were reported,” according to the release. “But complications from the bypass surgery were similar in both groups, including time in intensive care and on a breathing machine, and infection rate.” The release satisfies this criterion but a few more details would have made the release even better. We are told that 60 subjects were enrolled and were randomly assigned to receive either botulinum toxin of saline. We are also told the study was blinded. Other important details about the study are omitted including baseline differences between the two groups, number of vessels engrafted, duration of bypass or number of off bypass procedures. All are important variables in the development of atrial fibrillation post operatively. Atrial fibrillation post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can dramatically impact the patient’s quality of life as well as potentially increase morbidity. The story does not over state the impact and provides statistics concerning its prevalence. The funding sources (The Russian State Research Institute of Circulation Pathology and the Siberian Division of Russian Academy of Medical Sciences) are noted in the release. Given the impact of post-operative atrial fibrillation, it is reasonable to assume that other attempts have been made to reduce its incidence in this population. A variety of antiarrhythmic drugs and beta adrenergic blockers have been studied with variable results. It would have been very helpful to add a few words about the alternative pharmalogical agents. Since the release makes no claim that this therapy is ready to be used outside of clinical trials we’ll give this a satisfactory. The story makes it clear that botulinum toxin is available and is routinely used in cosmetic dermatology. For that use it’s sold under the trade name Botox Cosmetic. However, there are four different FDA approved strains of the toxin. Various formulations of the toxin have received  FDA approval for use in treating excessive sweating, migraines, dystonia, bladder control issues, and several other non-cosmetic conditions. Those formulations have been available for many years as well. Since this is the first time botulinum toxin has been tested in human hearts, it’s safe to say that it could be several years before it receives approval as a preventative for heart complications. The release is clear that larger studies are needed. Dr. Steinberg’s comments on the study being the “first in man” establishes the novelty of the approach. The release does not use unjustifiable language. Instead, the language is very measured and appropriate.",true,"Association/Society news release,cardiovascular disease"

It would allow patients with diseases including cancer and multiple sclerosis to use a non-intoxicating oil derived from the marijuana plant. To qualify, patients or their caregivers would have to register with the state Department of Public Health after getting a physician’s certification that they are being treated for one of the medical conditions covered by the bill. Georgia would become the 12th U.S. state to allow non-intoxicating oil for medical use, said Erik Altieri, spokesman for the pro-marijuana organization NORML. Another 23 states allow regular marijuana to be smoked for medicinal purposes, said Altieri. The bill covers a “decent range of conditions” for medical marijuana use, said Altieri.

There once was some truth to the following warnings about an online stalker of women called ‘DreamWeaverGrey’ (originally ‘Slavemaster’), but it’s long outdated:  If a person with the screen-name of DreamWeaverGrey contacts you, do not reply. DO not talk to this person; do not answer any of whispers or requests for private in Pogo. Whoever this person may be, he/she is a suspect for murder in the deaths of 56 women (so far) contacted through the Internet. This screen-name has also been seen on Yahoo, AOL, AIM, and Excite so far. This is not a joke! Please send this to men too… just in case! Send to everyone you know! Ladies, this is serious. If a guy by the name of SlaveMaster contacts you do not answer. He has killed 56 women that he has talked to on the internet. PLEAZE SEND OUT TO ALL THE WOMEN ON YOUR BUDDY LIST. ALSO ASK THEM TO PASS THIS ON. He has been on {{   Yahoo- Aol– Excite }} so far. This is no JOKE.!!!!!! AND PLEASE SEND THIS TO MEN TO…….JUST IN CASE! Send to EVERY ONE YOU KNOW!! John Edward Robinson Sr., 56, was arrested on 2 June 2000 and charged with sexual assault on two women in the Kansas City area. Robinson lured the women (as he had others) into participating in sadomasochistic sex by contacting them over the Internet under the name “slavemaster.”  The two women filed charges after Robinson “brutalized them in a way that went beyond what they intended.” After Robinson’s arrest, law enforcement authorities discovered two 55-gallon industrial barrels, each containing a woman’s body, on land Robinson owned in Kansas. A few days later, they discovered three more bodies in barrels kept in a storage space Robinson rented in Missouri. All five women appeared to have been bludgeoned to death. Robinson was also suspected in the mid-1980s disappearances of three women and an infant whose bodies had not yet been located. One of the bodies Robinson had stored in barrels was later identified as being one of these women, and the missing infant was discovered to have been adopted by Robinson’s brother. In October 2002, John Robinson was convicted of the murder of three women, the two found in the barrels on his land, and the third the disappeared mother of the child he placed with his brother. In January 2003 he was sentenced to death for these murders. He has also been charged in the deaths of the three women found in Missouri. The “slavemaster” is monstrously real, but so far he’s well short of the 56 victims claimed for him, and he remains behind bars, not out trolling the Internet for additional victims. This internet warning took on a life of its own, one quite independent of the facts. The small grain of truth (someone using the screen name “Slavemaster” was arrested for the murders of women he contacted on the Internet) was lost amidst the sandstorm of claims that he was still out there looking for more victims, and that he had killed 56 women so far. As well, pranksters have been pulling off jokes by substituting their acquaintances’ screen names in place of “Slavemaster,” so now versions are circulating that warn netizens to be on the lookout for someone using the handle “Dodgecity53_,” “SweetCaliGuy4evr,” “ooosparklesooo88,” “DreamWeaverGrey,” “Monkeyman935,” “Free_mumia911,””ineedatipdrill,” “RatBonesBlakStar,” “Silly Black Goose,” “Buc Vet,” “Rooster,” “spikey_mikey913,” or “Darksideishere1,” all screen names that have nothing to do with the real John Edward Robinson.",false,"Crime, crime warnings, Murdering Madmen"
493,30340,"The National Cancer Institute has ""admitted"" that ""cannabis kills cancer.","June 4, 2018","Because the article making the claim that the NCI “admitted” that “cannabis kills cancer” uses information from a document that has no legal bearing on federal drug policy, and because that information does not in any way “prove” that cannabis could be a viable treatment for cancer, we rank this claim as false.",Alex Kasprak,"An August 2015 article published on the website PoliticusUSA contains the claim that an update to an National Institutes of Health document included a “quiet” admission that marijuana “kills cancer”: In just the past two weeks, the federal government and NIH have quietly confirmed that cannabis (marijuana) is very effective at killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells like radiation and chemotherapy. In fact, on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease, Cancer.gov, they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting [sic] cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, prison system, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level. That PoliticusUSA story has been, and continues to be, used as source material for variations on a “Cancer Institute Finally Admits Marijuana Kills Cancer” clickbait article that is cloned on a variety of low-rent websites. The “report” in question is the NCI’s Physician Data Query (PDQ) on “Cannabis and Cannabinoids.” The National Cancer Institute maintains a database of peer-reviewed cancer research and publishes regular updates and summaries of this research in a product called known as a PDQ: The PDQ cancer information summaries are comprehensive, evidence-based summaries on topics that cover adult and pediatric cancer treatment, supportive and palliative care, screening, prevention, genetics, and integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies. Perplexingly, viral stories citing a 2015 update to this PDQ report as some sort of smoking gun do so for no clear reason. Both the pre-update and post-update versions of the PDQ mentioned laboratory and animal studies that suggest potential anti-tumor effects from cannabis, and both versions include phrases that could be loosely (and falsely) interpreted as “marijuana kills cancer.” The earliest NIH cannabis PDQ archived on the Internet Archive is a 6 November 2014 version, and the sections related to the potential anti-tumor capabilities of cannabis is identical to the  allegedly nefarious July 2015 update. Both include this statement in the “overview section”: Cannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory (see Question 6) The mysterious Question 6 (the other item cited by these viral studies as proof of some sort of admission by the government) provides information regarding a number of preclinical trials that have shown some promise at killing cancerous cells. That list includes studies on mice, rats, and cell lines suggesting that some cannabinoids (the group of medically relevant chemicals in cannabis) may be able to selectively kill cancerous cells — including those found in colon, liver, and breast cancers. That list was also not modified in any way between 2014 and mid-2018, save for the addition of one new clinical review added to the PDQ in 2017. Since the addition of that study occurred after PoliticusUSA published their article, their assertion that the PDQ was changed in a way that could be interpreted as a quiet “admission” of anything regarding anti-tumor potential in July 2015 is false. The PDQ does reference studies that suggest a possible medical role for cannabis in cancer treatment, but to claim that these changes were added “quietly” in 2015 is complete fiction. Equally made up is the claim that the studies referenced in the PDQ “prove” that cannabis “kills” cancer. The studies referenced in the PDQ are small scale preclinical trials (or reviews of such trials), and therefore they do not “prove” anything with regards to efficacy as a treatment for cancer in humans, which is a broad and diverse groups of diseases unlikely to be “cured” by a single chemical or group of chemicals. The number of drugs or treatments that have demonstrated preclinical potential only to be rejected after further study is prodigious: The organization Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America estimates that only 5 in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing, and only 1 of those 5 may be safe and effective enough to reach pharmacy shelves. A major hurdle preventing human research on cannabis is that the United States government controversially considers it a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substance Act, meaning that the official position is that it has “no currently accepted medical use,” which limits research into its possible medical value. While the anti-tumor studies cited in the NCI PDQ could be part of a broader argument to remove marijuana from that Schedule 1 classification, they do not provide clear evidence that cannabis can be a viable cancer treatment. Further, a PDQ report, which are merely reviews of scientific studies regularly updated by scientists at the NIH, does not have any bearing on the United States Government’s official view toward cannabis, and is wholly independent of any regulatory bodies or legal or political decision making groups: PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.",false,"Medical, cancer, cannabis, marijuana"

In 2003, while in the state Senate, Wasserman Schultz was part of a unanimous vote for a seven-year delay to clean up the Everglades. Canova omits that two days later she changed her vote, but the vote had no practical effect and the measure passed anyway. Canova also said Wasserman Schultz voted to subsidize the sugar industry when she voted for the farm bill in 2008 and 2014. The farm bills didn’t contain actual cash subsidies, but they clearly contained lucrative benefits for the industry. The farm bill is a sweeping bill that benefits a long list of programs -- not just sugar. Wasserman Schultz has taken other steps to support Everglades cleanup. But Canova’s point about her specific actions is largely accurate.",Amy Sherman,"A nasty-looking toxic algae bloom on Florida’s coasts has oozed into political races, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s Democratic primary. Her opponent, Tim Canova, toured the mucky scene in Stuart wearing a surgical mask. He says that Wasserman Schultz shares in the blame for the algae that extends from Lake Okeechobee to Florida coastlines on the Treasure Coast and west coast. Canova said Wasserman Schultz, who represents South Florida, has sided with the main polluters of the water that flows into the Everglades: the sugar industry. Wasserman Schultz doesn’t ""want us to know that she has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry and other agribusinesses, as well as for delays in cleanups, while failing to deliver federal funds for any real solution,"" he said on Medium July 9. Wasserman Schultz defended her environmental record to the Sun Sentinel, concluding, ""I will continue to walk the walk on fighting to restore our precious River of Grass while my opponent just continues to talk."" Time for PolitiFact Florida to weigh in. Algae and Big Sugar Everybody agrees that the algae is bad for the environment and business. But they disagree on who is to blame. Pollution from fertilizer, manure and septic waste from suburbs and farms poured into Lake Okeechobee. That pollution stimulated the growth of algae, so when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released water from the lake to avoid a breach of the surrounding dike, the algae-ridden water traveled to other waters in Florida. Some politicians blame the federal government for the water release as well as its failure to raise the dike. Others blame the state of Florida for siding with the sugar industry and resisting calls to redirect water through sugar land. In Florida, Big Sugar has given generously to state and local politicians and to federal candidates, including Wasserman Schultz. ""The sugar industry is completely ambidextrous as far as its ability to penetrate the Republican and Democratic camps,"" said Charles Lee, director of advocacy for Audubon Florida. Everglades delay vote Canova’s campaign points to Wasserman Schultz’s vote in the state Senate to delay Everglades cleanup and to votes on two farm bills while in Congress. In 2003, then state Sen. Wasserman Schultz voted to delay for seven years the requirement for sugar companies to clean up polluted discharges that had hurt the Everglades. It passed the state Senate 38-0 and the House 96-18, and Gov. Jeb Bush signed it into law. The well-financed sugar industry fought for the delay, while environmental groups opposed it. Two days later, Wasserman Schultz changed her vote to ""no"" because she said she was ""betrayed and misled"" about the facts. The Senate passed amendments that they believed were offered by the U.S. Justice Department but had actually been written by state environmental officials. Changing a vote is ceremonial only and carries zero practical effect -- except public relations. Ryan Banfill, Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman, said that she initially supported the bill because it included a provision to buy sugar lands for filtration and was better than a 20-year-delay alternative. Sugar votes in Congress Canova’s campaign also says Wasserman Schultz supported the sugar industry because of her votes to renew the 1981 Farm Bill in 2008 and 2014. The legislation is a sweeping bill that funds an array of nutrition and agriculture programs for multiple years. So if Wasserman Schultz voted against the farm bill, she would have also voted against food stamps, assistance to food banks and economic development programs in rural areas such as providing broadband internet service. But if Wasserman Schultz had opposed the sugar portion of the bills she could have said so and she didn’t, Canova’s campaign said. The farm bill gives lucrative benefits to the sugar industry. Specifically, it gives loans to processors and limits sugar imports to the United States. The government can also buy the surplus sugar and sell it for ethanol production. These benefits amount to market controls that reduce the supply of sugar, thus making it more expensive, said Josh Sewell, a policy analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that is critical of the sugar policy. The industry disagrees with the term ""subsidy."" ""A direct subsidy -- a check -- we do not get that,"" said Ryan Weston, executive vice president of the Florida Sugarcane League. But Sewell said the price controls, marketing allotments and limits on imports are all government manipulations designed to provide an economic benefit to a set group and function as subsidies. ""Any governmental action that reduces the cost of doing business or increases prices beyond the normal functioning of a free market is a subsidy,"" he said. ""In this case consumers, food manufacturers, and sugar producers outside of the United States are on the losing end."" The industry argues it needs the aid to compete globally with other countries that subsidize sugar and that the aid helps save jobs. Critics, including candy companies and consumer watchdogs, argue that it drives up prices for consumers and amounts to corporate welfare. In recent years, there have been several national proposals by Democrats and Republicans to change the sugar program, but votes are rare. In June 2013, however, the House and Senate voted on sugar amendments that would have scaled back the industry’s benefits. The amendments failed in both chambers with Wasserman Schultz voting ""no."" Most of the Florida delegation voted against the amendment, including both of Florida’s senators Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Bill Nelson, a Democrat. Banfill said Wasserman Schultz voted against the amendment because she said it would keep the market stable, protect American jobs and maintain the program allowing the government to buy and then sell surplus sugar to ethanol producers. Lee, of Audubon Florida, says Wasserman Schultz isn’t alone in her support of the federal government’s sugar policy: ""The same attack could be applied to virtually every member of Congress from Florida and it could be applied to virtually every member of the Legislature."" Banfill pointed to other efforts by Wasserman Schultz to clean up the Everglades and her 92 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters. She has supported a clean water rule proposed by the EPA and helped get the authorization included in the budget for multiple segments of the Tamiami Trail to restore natural water flow to part of the Everglades. She is one of many cosponsors of the Central Everglades Planning Project that includes restoration projects but hasn’t received a vote yet. Those are all steps that could help the Everglades and the environment, but the sugar industry’s benefits from the government remain in place. ""Yes, these positions were important and significant,"" Lee said. ""However, these positions did not really challenge the sugar industry. On core issues for ‘big sugar’ they have her support."" This is no different from every other major political leader in Florida, he added. Our ruling Canova said Wasserman Schultz ""has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry ... as well as for delays in cleanups."" In 2003, while in the state Senate, Wasserman Schultz was part of a unanimous vote for a seven-year delay to clean up the Everglades.

WHO recommends that this test should not be performed under any circumstances.,Bethania Palma,"Rap artist T.I., also known by his full name as Clifford Joseph Harris, Jr., received widespread backlash for an interview in which he claimed to take his daughter to be examined by a gynecologist annually to check whether she remains a virgin. T.I. made the comments during a podcast interview on Nov. 5, 2019, which has since been taken down. The comments drew harsh criticism prompting podcast hosts Nazanin Mandi and Nadia Moham, of the show “Ladies Like Us,” to apologize. Mandi and Moham posted on the social platform Instagram that they regretted their reaction to T.I.’s statements but said that they were caught off guard by them. A post shared by Ladies Like Us Podcast (@theladieslikeuspodcast) on Nov 7, 2019 at 7:37am PST  T.I. has remained silent. Our email to his record label with questions about his comments went unanswered, and he has made no statements to the news media or on social media. His daughter, 18-year-old model Deyjah Harris, has also avoided commenting directly on the matter. During the podcast episode in question, T.I. stated, “This is what we do: Right after the birthday, we celebrate. And usually like the day after the party, she’s enjoying her gifts, I put a sticky note on the door: ‘Gyno. Tomorrow. 9:30,'” according to the Los Angeles Times: The Atlanta rapper, who also goes by the nickname Tip, went on to explain that the physician — “maintaining a high level of professionalism” — always tells him that his daughter has to sign away her privacy before results can be shared, and always tells him that a hymen can be broken in many ways that do not involve sex. “I say, ‘Look, doc, she don’t ride no horses, she don’t ride no bike, she don’t play no sports. Man, just check the hymen please and give me back my results expeditiously,’” he said, referring to “results” that legally belong to his daughter. The comments were quickly and broadly condemned, while gynecologist Jennifer Gunter took the opportunity to write a 12-tweet, mini-lecture that points out the hymen isn’t an indicator of virginity: The hymen means nothing physically and hymen exams are medically not a thing and are unnecessary. And support a disgusting patriarchal trope. 11/12 pic.twitter.com/D1EjoqZeiB — Jennifer Gunter (@DrJenGunter) November 6, 2019  In 2018, three United Nations agencies, the World Health Organization, UN Human Rights, and UN Women called for a ban on such so-called virginity tests, calling them harmful and medically meaningless: These examinations are not only a violation of women’s and girls’ human rights, but in cases of rape can cause additional pain and mimic the original act of sexual violence, leading to re-experience, re-traumatization and re-victimization. Many women suffer from adverse short- and long-term physical, psychological and social consequences of this practice. This includes anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress.

497,9227,Electro-acupuncture for disrupted sleep in women with breast cancer,"December 1, 2016","This short release reports on a small study looking at whether electro-acupuncture is effective in diminishing night-time hot flashes among breast cancer survivors, and therefore, improving the quality of their sleep. While it states that this therapeutic approach is as good as, or perhaps better, than a drug (gabapentin) often prescribed for hot flashes, the release offers no data showing the extent of improvement, nor are there mentions of the cost of such treatments, or of potential harms from using it which, while not enormous, are not negligible either. The release also neglects to identify any of the researchers involved in the trial. More and more people are surviving breast cancer and there is increasing interest among survivors and clinicians about quality of life for survivors. As the release states, perhaps 6 million patients may have survived by the year 2020, meaning even serious discomforts like hot flashes among such patients will become a growing problem. The release hints that this approach may be effective for such people, but it fails to provide aspects critical to really evaluating this “news.”","Earle Holland,Christine K. Norton, MA,Kathlyn Stone","There was no mention in the release as to the cost of electro-acupuncture, although a quick search on the web revealed that the costs per session could range anywhere from $60 to $150. Nor did the release give any information about the number of sessions required to acheive improved sleep — a single one or multiple. Lastly, the release gives no indication whether Medicare or health insurance plan will cover electro-acupuncture, a factor that can affect whether many patients would choose this treatment. The release stated that the use of electro-acupuncture was “comparable to, if not better than” the drug (gabapentin) that was used in this comparative study in reducing “hot flash severity and frequency and improving overall sleep quality.”  This kind of vague statement doesn’t help readers looking for some quantification, or degree of change, provided by this alternative therapy. The release also states that “although electro-acupuncture produced significant sleep improvements, researchers noted that sleep quality for the participants was still not as good as it should be.”  But again, there is no scale of benchmark provided which would help a reader gauge the effectiveness, and therefore the worth, of trying electro-acupuncture. The release makes no mention of potential harms or side effects from the use of electro-acupuncture, which like traditional acupuncture, is considered to be of relatively low risk. But neither is without risk entirely, given that infection is possible along with bleeding or other injury. Electro-acupuncture is not suggested for people with heart problems, strokes, seizures or epilepsy, nor should it be used by patients with cardiac pacemakers since the small current used can disrupt the function of these devices. These risks should have been included in the release. The release provides no details about how the study was conducted or about the participants in the study, especially regarding their overall health, the length and type of treatment they had for their breast cancer, or the length of time since their breast cancer diagnosis and  treatment. Nor does the release include any specifics  about how the participants’ sleep and specific aspects of their sleep were measured. The release does say that the research involved a “randomized, controlled trial,” which offers some detail, as does the fact that “58 breast cancer survivors” who experienced bothersome hot flashes participated. But 58 is considered a small study size. The release correctly points out that “blinded controlled trials are needed.” This release steps over the line in suggesting that hot flashes — a normal part of menopause for some women and especially for breast cancer survivors — is like a disease unto itself that always requires medical treatment. According to Johns Hopkins University, about 75 percent of all women going through menopause experience hot flashes, the most common symptom of menopause. Many are able to manage their symptoms through simple, inexpensive lifestyle changes. The release notes that the research was funded in part by the National Cancer Institute but it makes no mention of potential conflicts of interest on the part of the researchers involved. We’ll give them the benefit of the doubt here since we don’t have access to the full published study to verify who the funders are or assess whether there are financial conflicts of interest. We encourage news releases to always disclose whether or not there are conflicts. The release points out that electro-acupuncture was compared with the drug gabapentin. But there are numerous other alternatives to both a fairly powerful drug with its own side effects and electro-acupuncture. There are many other ways to help one sleep while experiencing hot flashes such as non-hormonal medications and lifestyle changes — dressing in layers, lowering the thermostat, staying away from caffeine — to name a few. The release doesn’t mention where or if electro-acupuncture is available to patients who desire such treatments. The release claims in the subhead that the “Study confirms benefits versus gabapentin for helping breast cancer survivors suffering from hot flashes achieve better sleep” but given that no additional information is provided in the release, it is hard to find such a vague conclusion is novel enough to warrant issuing a news release. Moreover, it appears that acupuncture has been used extensively in previous studies for hot flashes in breast cancer patients, so some comment on that approach, and how “electro-acupunture” might differ, is warranted. No unjustifiable language was used here.",false,"electro-acupuncture,North American Menopause Society (NAMS)"

""The greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn’t look like this,"" Gates says as behind him appears a giant image of a bomb exploding. ""Instead,"" Gates continues, ""it looks like this."" The picture overhead changes to what appears to be a giant microbe, an image similar to the graphics that news organizations and others use to illustrate their stories about the new coronavirus . ""If anything kills a million people over the next few decades, it’s most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war,"" Gates says. ""Not missiles, but microbes."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Gates did say these words on a stage. And the images that appear in the video on Facebook did show on a screen behind him as he spoke. But this post goes too far by suggesting Gates specifically predicted COVID-19. No mention of coronavirus in Gates’ original 2015 speech On March 19, Gates published a blog post addressing questions about COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus that was first reported in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31, 2019. The post is an edited transcript of an Ask Me Anything session he did on Reddit on March 18. In it, he refers to a TED talk he did in 2015. Footage from this talk is what appears in the Facebook video. The Facebook video is only a clip of Gates’ comments. The actual talk begins with him discussing how when he was a kid, the disaster Americans feared most was a nuclear war. But his line that opens the Facebook video comes soon after. He goes on to say that ""we’ve actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic. We’re not ready for the next epidemic."" He doesn’t use the word ""coronavirus"" in his speech. He does discuss Ebola and the failures in combating the disease’s outbreak in West Africa in 2014 — the largest Ebola outbreak since the virus was discovered in 1976, according to the World Health Organization. In aftermath of Ebola, Gates did warn of another epidemic About 10,000 people died during the Ebola outbreak and nearly all deaths were in West Africa, Gates said in his TED talk. The disease didn’t spread more, in part, because it didn’t spread through the air, and by the time patients are contagious, they’re generally so sick they’re bedridden. ""The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola,"" Gates said. ""Next time we might not be so lucky. You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they’re infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market. The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism. So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse."" Gates cited the 1918 Spanish flu as an example of a virus that spreads through the air. ""So here’s what would happen,"" he says. ""It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly. And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic. So this is a serious problem. We should be concerned."" He then discusses how we could build a good response system — how we could be prepared for the next epidemic. ""There’s no need to panic,"" he says. ""We don’t have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down to the basement. But we need to get going, because time is not on our side. In fact, if there’s one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic, it’s that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call, to get ready. If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic."" Our ruling The Facebook post says that Gates told Americans about the coronavirus in 2015. But in the 2015 TED talk featured in the video, he never actually uses the word coronavirus, nor does he mention COVID-19. His comments do sound prescient, though. He talks about an epidemic and we’re now in the midst of a pandemic. People could be infected with COVID-19 and not show symptoms for days, if at all.

502,29142,A new Facebook feature enabling users to report problems by shaking their phones has caused some users to be inadvertently reported for abuse and suspended.,"June 14, 2019",What's true: Facebook has begun rolling out a 'shake-to-report' feature in their mobile app. What's false: The feature does not collect reports about abusive posts or other terms-of-service violations and cannot accidentally trigger account suspensions.,David Emery,"Did you know Facebook’s mobile app has a new feature that allows users to report problems by shaking their phones? No? Neither did we, until readers alerted us to a viral Facebook post claiming that a new “shake-to-report” feature was inadvertently landing some people in “Facebook jail” (meaning their accounts had been suspended). Warnings such as this one started to appear online in mid-June 2019:  Here’s the text of the post, minus emojis: PSA FACEBOOK NEEDS TO STOP AVOID FB JAIL I shook my phone and it’s a REAL thing! It took me a little bit, but it really is a thing! I turned mine off! Your public service announcement for today: The recent FB update added this new feature for mobile fb users. Since this update – some people have landed in FB jail multiple times (yes, it’s a real place and there’s no fair trial or bail out options!) One has been in & out for over a week now It seems many of us are accidentally ‘reporting a problem’ and getting our friends thrown in jail. How can you fix it? When you’re in FB, shake your phone around until this shows up. Then slide that ‘shake phone to report a problem’ button to OFF! It’s CRAZY that none of us knew this had been added and that it was automatically ON with the update. Fix your phones – Let’s keep our friends (and me lol) out of FB jail! This is no joke shake your phone! Not fast or hard. I just removed mine. With little-to-no fanfare, Facebook began rolling out a new “shake-to-report” feature in their mobile app in late May 2019. The tech news website Engadget described the rollout on 28 May: Facebook wants to make reporting bugs as easy as shaking your phone. In fact, that’s all you’ll have to do. Thanks to a new feature, when you encounter a bug, you can simply shake your phone and file a report through a pop-up menu that will appear on the screen. The “shake to report” method was previously available as an opt-in feature on iOS, and it will soon be a default setting on both iOS and Android. You’ll still be able to report bugs through Facebook’s Help & Support menu, but the company says it’s hoping this new method will be easier to use. In addition to reporting when News Feed doesn’t load or a video won’t play, Facebook also wants users to report when they can’t figure out how to complete an action, like how to delete a story. Facebook is rolling this out to a small percentage of users globally, but within the next two weeks, it should be available to everyone. Facebook confirmed all this in an email to Snopes.com, including that “shake to report” is enabled by default. The easiest way to find out if you have it is to run the Facebook app, then give your phone a gentle shake. A pop-up screen should appear giving you the option of reporting a problem or disabling the shake-to-report feature altogether:  (You can access the same screen via the main Facebook app menu, under Help & Support > Report a Problem.) There are two more things to notice about the screen “Shake phone to report a problem”: First, it doesn’t automatically send a report to Facebook. It provides a link to a report form requiring the user to explain the problem. That means a report can’t be sent accidentally. Second, it clearly says that the shake-to-report feature is to report “something isn’t working,” not to report abusive posts or other terms-of-service violations. Note that a link is offered at the bottom to call up instructions for reporting abuse (see Facebook’s help page for those instructions). That means you can’t use the shake-to-report feature for issues other than technical ones. In summary, is the “shake-to-report” feature real? Yes, and if it has been rolled out to your app, it’s automatically enabled. You can disable it (if you wish to) by shaking your phone to call up the screen and turning it off, or by doing the same via the app’s Help & Support menu. Is it possible to inadvertently send reports or suspend someone’s account by using the feature? No, that’s not how it works. You might want to share this information with friends who are spreading the rumor.",false,"Technology, facebook"
503,841,Crop invaders: China's small farmers struggle to defeat armyworm.,"August 9, 2019","Yan Wenliu leans on the side of his cart as he prepares to leave his sugarcane field in Southwest China, bewildered by the formidable new pest that has ambushed his crops this year.","Hallie Gu, Ryan Woo","“I don’t know what it is,” says Yan, a 36-year-old farmer from Menghai county in Yunnan province. “But it is bigger than other ones. I have never seen this worm before.”  The creature Yan is unable to name is the fall armyworm, the larva of the fall armyworm moth. Known locally as the “heart-devouring worm,” the destructive pest has spread more than 3,000 km (1,865 miles) north since migrating from neighboring Myanmar seven months ago, reaching 21 provinces and regions in China and posing a grave threat to grain output. In Yunnan alone, where the pest struck first in China, some 1.29 million mu (86,000 hectares) had been affected by mid-June, including corn, sugarcane, sorghum and ginger crops. First found in the Americas, fall armyworm has spread through Africa and Asia since 2016, with the moths flying up to 100 km (60 miles) a night. It can’t be eradicated and its management is both costly and difficult. This poses a formidable challenge in China where about 90% of crop production comes from small farms of less than a hectare (2.5 acres) and owners lack basic knowledge and resources to tackle the pest. Beijing warned earlier this year that armyworm was a severe threat to the country’s food security and in May launched a campaign to “snatch grain from the insect’s mouth.”   Millions of yuan have been allocated to affected regions and experts sent to educate farmers. In Yunnan, the government has set up 3,500 monitoring sites at local agriculture bureaus and conducted frequent field inspections, the provincial agriculture bureau said in an email to Reuters. Local authorities have also provided training to farmers and pesticide dealers on identification and prevention of armyworm, the bureau added. (Graphic: Fall Armyworm invasion of Asia IMG, tmsnrt.rs/2XYNbIX)  PESTICIDE OR PENNILESSTo those in Yunnan, the solution to the worm problem seemed obvious - pesticide. “You have to keep spraying chemicals. If you don’t kill the worm, you will end up penniless,” says sugarcane farmer Yan in Mengkang village. But paying for the pesticide in the quantities required has left many farmers out of pocket, while a failure to follow the complex regime needed - using different pesticides at different crop growth stages and rotating them to prevent resistance - means the money is often wasted. “You just can’t kill them,” says Yan Hannen, a 44-year-old farmer, from nearby Nuodong. “I have been farming for 20 years but have never seen this many worms.”  A frustrated Yan applied pesticides fives times to his last crop of sweet corn, but output nearly halved. He has already sprayed his new crop twice, to little effect. “They told me to use one bucket but I used three. It still did not work. What can you do?” he asked. Local government has held many meetings to brief farmers on the pest and villagers have improved their approach to using pesticides, said Yan Xiangwa, a village official in Nuodong. But for farmers who have already battled severe drought this year, the latest threat has put their entire livelihoods at risk. Villagers tend to give up treatment due to the high cost, the Yunnan provincial government said in a report last month, adding that sufficient human resources for plant protection were also lacking at the local level. Yu Xianger, another Nuodong farmer, sprayed pesticide on her 2 mu (0.13 hectare) corn field without results and is thinking about finding work in the city. “The worms have devastated my corn crops this year. And there’s nothing much else I can do,” she said. (Graphic: Areas suitable for Fall Armyworm , tmsnrt.rs/2XYgvPY)  Experts say the fight against armyworms is difficult and the enemy is a tough one. Adept at hiding, the pest is hard to detect and prefers to venture out at night, to feast on plants and fly to new pastures. “Local farmers here didn’t use much pesticide before and wouldn’t buy chemicals until they saw the worms, meaning they might have missed the best time to kill them,” said Yao, a sales manager for pesticide supplier Jingbo Agrochemicals Technology Co Ltd in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province. The villagers’ slow response to the arrival of armyworm was not helped by the absence of a trapping system involving lights and pheromones that Beijing says is currently being deployed nationwide. The Yunnan agriculture bureau says it has set up more than 30,000 such trapping systems in the province and is continuously carrying out preventive measures and treatment against the pest, involving chemicals and natural enemies. While some villages have been badly affected, the government says the province as a whole has been managing the problem. The damage has been “effectively controlled” in Yunnan, with total corn crop losses limited to within 5%, it said in the email. This year’s summer grain output in Yunnan increased by 16,200 tonnes from the previous year, the bureau said, citing official statistics. Despite the problems in the country’s south, the outlook for China’s main corn production area in the north is “much better,” says Hu Gao, professor of insect ecology at Nanjing Agricultural University. Control and prevention measures have given the region, which accounts for more than 70% of China’s corn production, more time to prepare for an invasion. The worm has yet to reach the northeastern provinces including Heilongjiang, the top grower of the grain, and some experts believe the lower temperatures in the region will protect it from a full attack. Back in Yunnan, however, farmer Yan Hannei is thinking about switching to other plants like vegetables. “I am going to lose so much money this year,” he says. “What can you do? I can only stop growing corn and grow something else.”",true,Environment
505,16025,"The Obama administration ""supported Muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard.","January 14, 2015","Turley said that the Obama administration ""supported Muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard."" The accuracy of this statement hinges on how you understand that word ""supported."" American diplomats did endorse a UN resolution that avoided words about restricting speech that defamed a religion, but left open the door to criminalizing speech that was ""incitement to immediate violence based on religion."" The administration, as well as some free-speech advocacy groups, saw this as progress. But blasphemy laws remain on the books in Muslim nations, and the largest international body that speaks for those nations has said plainly that such laws are appropriate and ought to be adopted in the west. Not even Turley argues that this is the result the administration wanted, and another critic of the administration's strategy said American diplomats do not support efforts to establish an international blasphemy standard. One could argue that by participating in the ongoing negotiations, the administration has de facto endorsed a vehicle for the Muslim nations, but that is not the same as supporting their efforts. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",Jon Greenberg,"France has braced itself for yet another round of Islamic extremist attacks as the latest issue of Charlie Hebdo hits the newsstands. Following the murders of most of the Paris-based satirical paper’s staff last week, the cover features a cartoon Mohammed with a tear rolling down his cheek, under a headline that reads in French, ""All is forgiven."" He holds the symbol of solidarity with the slain journalists, a sign that says ""Je suis Charlie,"" or ""I am Charlie."" While that message might be somber, a powerful vein of Muslim thought sees any depiction of Mohammed as blasphemous. Cartoons like this were what drew death threats in the past. In this violent clash between the pen and the sword, politicians and pundits in the western democracies largely put the onus on the Islamic world to uphold the principle of freedom of expression. But a prominent American law professor wrote in a Sunday Washington Post op-ed that the Obama administration itself has abetted the forces of intolerance. In that op-ed, Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School primarily criticized the French for passing laws that criminalize speech that insults, defames or incites violence on the basis of religion, race, or other social marker. At the end of his piece, however, Turley brings his critique closer to home. ""In 2009, the Obama administration shockingly supported Muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard,"" Turley wrote, ""And as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton invited delegations to Washington to work on implementing that standard."" Has the administration really supported Muslim countries as they seek to spread an international standard forbidding blasphemy? We took a closer look. (For the record, Turley is representing House Republicans in their health care lawsuit against the president, but his stance on this issue came long before.) At the heart of Turley’s argument is American support for United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18. The U.S. goal was to establish common ground for religious tolerance. Or, as the opening lines of the resolution put it, ""to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction as to, inter alia, religion or belief."" Approved in March 2011, the document has many clauses. These three are the most relevant to our fact-check: It affirms ""the positive role that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information can play in strengthening democracy and combating religious intolerance."" It ""condemns any advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, whether it involves the use of print, audio-visual or electronic media or any other means."" In a list of ""actions to foster a domestic environment of religious tolerance, peace and respect,"" it calls on states to adopt ""measures to criminalize incitement to imminent violence based on religion or belief."" For Turley and other free speech advocates, the kicker is that last point and the green light it gives to criminalizing expressions that incite others to violence. ""The president has said that he does not support criminalizing blasphemy, but the reality is that the language of the resolution criminalizes the same speech,"" Turley told PunditFact. A quick history of blasphemy at the UN The effort to give blasphemy laws international legal standing at the United Nations goes back 15 years. It was largely a project of Muslim nations working through the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, an umbrella group with 57 member countries. In committees like the Human Rights Council, they were able to win majority support for policies to rein in freedom of expression in the name of preventing religious defamation. The United States and Western European representatives opposed these moves on free speech grounds, but found themselves out-voted. The Islamic nations pressed the defamation issue until a few years ago. Then in 2011, compromise language emerged that dropped any reference to blasphemy or defamation. The measure passed by unanimous consent. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it a landmark achievement. ""The United States strongly supports today’s resolution, which rejects the broad prohibitions on speech called for in the former ‘defamation of religions’ resolution, and supports approaches that do not limit freedom of expression or infringe on the freedom of religion,"" Clinton said in a prepared statement. Human rights advocacy groups, such as Human Rights First and British-based Article 19, also endorsed the measure. Human Rights First wrote, ""Resolution 16/18 ceases to provide cover for national blasphemy laws and charts a new course. The resolution omits any reference to ‘defamation of religions’ and — in accordance with international standards — focuses on the protection of individuals, rather than the protection of abstract ideas and religions."" We reached out to the White House to learn how the ""incitement to immediate violence"" phrase is different from the religious defamation language sought by the Muslim governments. We did not hear back, but in a published letter, two high-level State Department officials, Michael Posner and Suzan Johnson Cook, explained how these words are in synch with American law. They cited the 1969 Brandenburg v. Ohio decision involving a member of the Ku Klux Klan. In its ruling,  the U.S. Supreme Court held that all speech is protected ""except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."" Posner and Cook wrote, ""drawing a caricature of the prophet Muhammad that resulted in violence by Muslim extremists would not constitute 'incitement to imminent violence' under the Brandenburg test."" Accordingly, the resolution, they said, would protect freedom of expression. Reading the UN rules differently Blasphemy laws are not rare. According to the Pew Research Center, in 2012 nearly a quarter of all countries had them. The list includes some European countries, such as Germany and Ireland, but the greatest concentration is in the Middle East where every Muslim nation from Egypt to Pakistan has them. In Pakistan, for example, a person could, in theory, be executed for insulting the prophet Mohammed or the Koran. No executions have happened, but in 2012, Pakistan prosecuted a dozen blasphemy cases. Muslim governments consistently argue that it is okay to restrict speech when that speech incites others to violence. Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu, Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation until 2014, made that clear in a 2012 interview with the French news service France24. İhsanoğlu spoke more than a year after the UN resolution passed and about a month after the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. ""The OIC — I as secretary — I am a staunch supporter of freedom of expression,"" İhsanoğlu said. ""But freedom of expression, according to international law, does not entail freedom of insulting others, denigrating others, mocking others."" For İhsanoğlu, just as no one has the right to randomly scream ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater, no one has the right to insult Mohammed if others might respond violently. When the interviewer pressed and said ""making fun of a religion doesn’t necessarily equate with incitement to violence,"" İhsanoğlu was adamant and specifically said that cartoons that mock Mohammed should be banned, in France and elsewhere. ""If you don’t respect the feelings of 1.5 billion people, and if you don’t feel yourself responsible not to insult them, then we have a problem here. And if we have a problem here, we will have a problem there, with the demonstrations and taking to street and using violence,"" İhsanoğlu said. The secretary-general went on to say that the anti-Islam video that contributed to the attack in Benghazi and the attack itself were two sides of the same coin. ""We are equating these acts together as incitement to hatred, incitement to violence. And we say we should not be hostages to extremists on either side,"" İhsanoğlu said. A year later, in a speech in Moscow, İhsanoğlu praised Resolution 16/18 for advancing the principle that freedom of expression did not include the right to defame any religion. He called the western concept, ""a ""twisted negative logic that is incomprehensible; that one exercises his freedom by insulting others, and not insulting just a few people, but insulting 1.6 billion people all over the world for no reason."" The record is clear. The governments of Islamic majority nations see no conflict between 16/18 and laws that ban cartoons of Mohammed or any other public act that might offend believers in Islam. A failed strategy? Adoption of the 16/18 resolution led to a series of meetings to put its lofty goals into practice. Turley’s op-ed referred to one such meeting held in Washington. On the issue of freedom of speech, those talks have yet to deliver the goods. Robert Blitt is an associate professor of law at the University of Tennessee College of Law and has studied this slice of international law very closely. Blitt told PunditFact that the process is faltering. ""The west is confronting the realization that the compromise effort that halted resolutions on defamation of religion and replaced them with an incitement-based approach did nothing to resolve the underlying, and still overriding, desire for the OIC to secure a prohibition on expression deemed defamatory of Islam,"" Blitt said. The American support for 16/18, Blitt said, probably bolstered the voices of moderate Muslim states that wanted to dial down the bad publicity they were getting with the defamation of religion resolutions. But Blitt said that tactic hasn’t shifted the Muslim position. ""I don’t think the administration is intentionally supporting efforts to establish a new blasphemy standard,"" Blitt said. ""However, its current stance represents an inadequate and miscalculated effort to create common ground."" This isn’t terribly far from Turley’s view. Turley told PunditFact that he has talked with administration officials about this. ""They always insisted that they were taking a different approach to try to moderate the Muslim countries,"" Turley said. The claim in his op-ed, Turley said, was not based on intentions, but results. And so far, the results, in his view, have been nill. Our ruling Turley said that the Obama administration ""supported Muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard."" The accuracy of this statement hinges on how you understand that word ""supported."" American diplomats did endorse a UN resolution that avoided words about restricting speech that defamed a religion, but left open the door to criminalizing speech that was ""incitement to immediate violence based on religion.""

506,21580,"Statistically, law-enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than the general population.","August 14, 2011",Retired police captain says law enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than most people,C. Eugene Emery Jr.,"Government pensions and other retirement benefits have provoked bitter debate between public employees, who have planned their retirements on the promise of a pension, and taxpayers who say the increasing costs of the benefits are more than they can afford. Retirement packages for police officers and firefighters often come under scrutiny because, in recognition of the extra stress and physical requirements of the job, they often permit workers to retire earlier. The threat of a pension cut in Cranston prompted Robert Barber, a 58-year-old retired captain in the city's Police Department, to argue that any reduction in benefits would be unfair. ""The City of Cranston entered into a contract with me. The agreement was that I would serve my community and risk my life so that, at the end of my career, if I reached it, I would be able to live the rest of my life with some dignity,"" he wrote in a commentary in The Journal. And, he wrote, that life is not likely to be as long as most retirees’. ""Statistically,"" he said, ""law-enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than the general population."" We were intrigued by that statistic. Police officers certainly experience a lot of stress in their jobs, but in some cases their level of physical fitness is higher. When we emailed Barber, who retired at age 50, he said he first heard the statistic in a Bryant University psychology class. He directed us to two documents. The first didn’t deal directly with longevity. It was a Reuters Health account of a 2009 study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, which compared 312 Buffalo, N.Y., police officers with 318 residents. Ultrasound showed that the officers tended to have thicker walls in their neck arteries, which might be an early sign of heart disease. The second was a 24-page report from 2002 on ""Fitness in Law Enforcement"" written by a member of the Pittsfield Township Police Department in Michigan. It promotes more fitness among officers and states, ""Solid research has shown the life expectancy, after retirement, of a police officer is much shorter than that of the general population."" But no research is cited. We were hoping for some harder evidence. So we went looking for some actuarial data on our own. When we called MetLife, the spokeswoman referred us to the Society of Actuaries. But the society didn't have any data either. ""Unfortunately, we do not keep this type of data regarding life expectancy for various careers,"" spokeswoman Kim McKeown told us in an email. We examined two websites that calculate life expectancy, but they were more interested in income, education, smoking, drinking, exercise and seatbelt habits, and whether a person was in a manual or non-manual occupation. Being a law-enforcement officer wasn't a factor in the calculation. The creator of one of the sites, statistician Dean P. Foster of The Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania pointed us to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that fishermen, loggers, pilots, farmers, roofers and even garbage men face a higher risk of death on the job than police officers. A Google search helped us locate Steven Greenhut, director of the journalism center at the right-leaning Pacific Research Institute in California and author of ""Plunder! How Public Employee Unions Are Raiding Treasuries, Controlling Our Lives And Bankrupting The Nation."" He sent us a copy of an April 2010 study by the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which covers 1.6 million public employees. It compared life expectancies for male police officers with male workers and retirees who were not in the public safety field. Whether a person was age 50, 55, 60 or 65, the life expectancies of the police officers were slightly higher than for other workers. For example, men age 60 who had taken regular retirement were projected to live to age 82.7, versus age 81.9 for workers who were not in the public safety field. (Firefighter rates were close to those for police officers.) Even when CalPERS added in all the men who had retired as a result of work-related injuries, the life expectancies of the police officers were essentially identical to other public employees. The life expectancy for someone age 60, regardless of why they stopped working, was 81.8 years, just a tenth of a year lower than for regular workers. In 2006, Oregon's Public Employees Retirement System did an analysis comparing the life expectancies of members who were age 60. Police officers and firefighters were expected to live to age 82.6. The ages were 84.3 for school workers and 83.4 for other public employees. Women in the police and fire departments, and workers outside the school districts were expected to live to age 85.7. Among women working in the schools, the life expectancy was 87.0 years. Where does that leave us? Barber said police officers die 10 years earlier than the general population. But the actuarial studies we found showed little difference in life expectancy. In the latest California study, police officers were actually expected to live a bit longer than other state employees. In Oregon, the combined life expectancy for police and fire was only slightly less than average.",false,"Rhode Island, Labor, Public Service, Retirement, Robert Barber, "

There have been at least 360 COVID-19 cases, including passengers and staff, associated with the vessel, which includes at least six deaths. As a popular Pacific port destination, Australia is among numerous countries around the world negotiating arrangements with cruise ships unable to find somewhere to dock. NSW Police said in a statement on Monday that the vessel may remain in place for up to 10 days, but the crew will not disembark unless approved by state authorities. Sick crew members were being treated on board or transferred to hospital, police said, and the vessel will be refuelled in preparation for departure. Australia has more than 5,700 confirmed COVID-19 cases and its death toll rose to 40 on Monday after five additional deaths were recorded overnight. An investigation into Ruby Princess protocols will focus on communications and actions that led to the docking and disembarking of the ship’s 2,700 passengers on March 19 at Sydney Harbour to see whether biosecurity laws or state laws were broken, authorities said. State health authorities had classed the ship as low risk, and the Australian Border Force issued a notice allowing the passengers to travel home freely. They were required to self-isolate for 14 days. A Carnival Australia spokesman said on Monday the company would cooperate with the probe. The ship has remained in Australian waters and on Monday docked at Port Kembla, with the remaining crew from 50 different countries on board to stay in isolation. The government banned cruise ships from docking except for emergencies as of mid-March and has sent off most of the cruise ships that remained in Australian waters over the past week. Australia has seen a sharp drop in the rate of new cases after closing national and state borders, quarantining people on all incoming flights in hotels for 14 days, restricting public gatherings to two, and shutting pubs, restaurants, and gyms. While the growth in new cases slows, the number of people contracting the virus from an unknown local source is steadily growing, particularly in NSW. Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said 8% of coronavirus cases are now locally acquired. Authorities remain concerned that some Australians are flouting social distancing rules, particularly around the country’s renowned beaches. After weekend crowds gathered on Sydney’s northern beaches and beaches along Queensland’s famed tourist strip the Gold Coast, local governments announced several beach closures. Australia’s most famous beach Bondi has been closed for the past two weeks, with police fining people who trespass. In efforts to better monitor local infections testing criteria will be widened beyond people who have been in contact with COVID-19 cases. The state of Victoria will now test anyone over 65, teachers and child care workers if they display any of symptom of coronavirus, while Western Australia will do the same. “If we can focus on those with compatible symptoms, coughs, sore throat, runny nose with or without a fever, and get them tested, then we will be able to see how much community transmission there might be,” said Victoria state’s Chief Medical Officer, Andrew Wilson. Pacific nations have so far avoided some of the more devastating effects of COVID-19 suffered in China, parts of Europe and the United States. New Zealand, which has been in lock-down since March 25, has recorded just over 1,100 confirmed cases. It has suffered one death linked to the virus. New Zealand’s Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said on Monday that the rate of increase in COVID-19 cases was “levelling off”.",true,Health News

REUTERS/Pawel Kopcznski/Files “It is both about consumption and population,” the U.N.’s Population Fund Executive Director Babatunde Osotimehin said at a media conference to launch the report, referring to people’s impact on the environment and economic growth. While growing populations could be a drain on the world’s resources, the U.N.’s Population Fund’s “The State of World Population 2011” released Wednesday said a contributing factor was overconsumption by the existing population. “With planning and the right investments in people now, to empower them to make choices that are not only good for themselves ... our world of 7 billion can have thriving sustainable cities, productive labor forces that fuel economies, and youth populations that contribute to the well-being of their societies,” Osotimehin said in the report. It was vital to engage with the world’s youth and to harness their entrepreneurial skills to boost economies and prevent potential alienation, the report said. Those under the age of 25 make up 43 percent of the population, and as much as 60 percent in some countries, and this group must be educated and trained if countries are to have a dynamic work force, it said. Failure to do so would see a loss of ideas, innovation as well as tax income. A major contributor to the recent Arab uprisings was a youth unemployment rate of nearly 25 percent, the report quoted the International Labor Organization as saying. The U.N. also said migration will become more significant in the coming century, with people moving across borders as well as within their own countries. The report looked at nine countries to see how they were responding to different rates of fertility and migration. In some of the poorest countries, high fertility rates have stunted development and perpetuated poverty, the report said. Getting girls to school and providing women with jobs and equal opportunities as well as sexual and reproductive healthcare including family planning was essential, it said. In some of the richest countries, low fertility rates and too few people entering the job market have raised fears about the prospects for sustained economic growth and the viability of social security systems. Every country has a population that is aging to some degree. The global proportion of people over the age of 60 is expected to grow from 11 percent in 2009 to 22 percent in 2050. In Finland, which enjoys a high standard of living but where low fertility rates have led to a quarter of the population being over 60 years old, the emphasis is on excellent social services to make parenthood easier. Academics have said that in countries such as China, which is getting older before it gets richer, there is need for old-age security, medical care and social services. More funding, including from governments and foundations, was needed, Osotimehin told reporters at the media conference. “Family planning, for instance, has not been funded as much as it should have been,” he said. A U.N. Secretary General report showed that $68 billion would be needed in 2011 if its program on sexual and reproductive health initiatives set out in Cairo in 1994 was to be met, Wednesday’s report said. Countries were expected to contribute $34 billion, with a further $10.8 billion coming from international and bilateral donors, leaving a shortfall of around $25 billion. Growing global interdependence meant governments had to work out how to deal with record populations if they were to avoid future competition for limited resources such as food and water. Reports already suggest a 40 percent global shortfall in water supply by 2030, while developing countries are buying up land in Africa to offset any future shortages at home.",true,Health News
514,1308,Clamor for GSK shingles shot points to bigger profits.,"June 25, 2018","GlaxoSmithKline is facing “unprecedented” demand for its new shingles vaccine Shingrix, suggesting the product could be a bigger money-spinner than the company and analysts initially thought.",Ben Hirschler,"In the short term, though, GSK faces a problem. While more than 1.5 million Americans have received Shingrix since the end of last year, others are having to wait, prompting the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to warn of shortages. GSK said it had increased deliveries significantly and was vaccinating people against shingles far faster than in the past, when Merck & Co’s Zostavax was the only product available. But it acknowledged it was struggling to keep up. “The arrival of Shingrix has been met with an unprecedented level of demand from patients and healthcare professionals,” a spokesman said. “Healthcare professionals are vaccinating with Shingrix at a rate many times that of prior years, so ordering limits and intermittent shipping delays should be expected for Shingrix during 2018.”  The CDC has recommended Shingrix over Merck’s older and less effective vaccine in adults 50 years and older, spurring the current strong demand. Consensus forecasts currently point to peak annual sales for Shingrix of around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion), according to Thomson Reuters data, with the U.S. market the main driver. But this number may prove to be too low, according Exane BNP analysts. The brokerage reckons sales could rise to 3 billion pounds if Shingrix can achieve market penetration rates of around 60 percent - double the level seen with Zostavax but similar to levels achieved by Pfizer’s pneumonia vaccine Prevnar. GSK said in April that Shingrix had got off to a flying start, with sales of 110 million pounds in its first full quarter on the market and 2018 sales expected to top 400 million. A company spokesman declined to give any update on that forecast ahead of second-quarter results next month. Shingrix is a key new product for GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley as she strives to improve the company’s commercial performance. It is also crucial for showing the profit potential of GSK’s large vaccines business, where GSK is looking to expand margins. GSK has already achieved its mid-term goal of getting vaccine margins to 30 percent and Exane BNP believes it could hit 35 percent by 2020, helped by the roll-out of Shingrix and other premium vaccines like Bexsero and Menveo against meningitis. Shingrix is given in two doses, separated by two to six months, while Zostavax is a single shot. Ensuring patients adhere to the two-shot regimen will be important in achieving the vaccine’s full sales potential. Shingles is caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus that is also responsible for chickenpox. Nearly all adults over 50 have the virus dormant in their nervous system and are at risk of it being reactivated with advancing age.",true,Health News
515,22968,"Texas leads ""the country in drunk driving fatalities.","November 18, 2010",Austin police chief says Texas leads nation in drunk driving deaths,W. Gardner Selby,"Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo cut to the chase during an interview about a law that lets drivers convicted of driving while intoxicated return to the road. ""We're in the worst state in the union when it comes to drunk driving and drunk driving fatalities,"" Acevedo said in an interview with the Austin American-Statesman and Austin's KVUE-TV, Channel 24. ""We lead the country in drunk driving fatalities."" The interview aired Sunday Nov. 14. Texas, No. 1 in alcohol-fueled driving deaths? We asked Acevedo how he reached his conclusion, then started checking national comparisons. An August 2010 report posted online appears to support the claim. In 2009, Texas tallied 1,235 alcohol-impaired fatalities, according to the report by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, which says the statistic reflects fatalities in crashes involving a driver or motorcycle rider with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 grams per deciliter or greater. The 2009 Texas total exceeded by more than 250 the 950 alcohol-related driving fatalities in California, which was the No. 2 state in the dubious category. States rounding out this top 10 were Florida (770), Pennsylvania (406), South Carolina (377), North Carolina (363), Georgia (331), Ohio (324), New York (321) and Illinois (319). Texas also topped other states in alcohol-impaired fatalities in 2008, the report says. The report also lays out the percentage of total traffic deaths due to alcohol impairment. Texas ranked No. 5 by this gauge, with alcohol impairment accounting for 40 percent of the 3,071 driving deaths in 2009. Four states had higher percentages: Hawaii, 48 percent of 109 deaths; Connecticut, 44 percent of 223 deaths; South Carolina, 42 percent of 894 deaths; and Washington, 42 percent of 492 deaths. Texas's 40 percent matched the percentages of deaths linked to alcohol impairment in South Dakota, Kansas and Rhode Island. Though Texas last year experienced one of the country's largest reductions in total traffic fatalities -- from 3,476 deaths in 2008 to 3,071 in 2009 -- more people still died on Texas roads than in any other state. As with drunk-driving deaths, that toll is influenced by factors such as Texas's size, population and number of miles traveled on its roads. In search of expert perspective on the meaning of such numbers, we reached Bernie Fette, a senior researcher at the Center for Transportation Safety at the Texas Transportation Institute in College Station. He showed us two other ways to compare alcohol-related driving deaths by state, based on the percentage of such deaths for every 100 million vehicle miles traveled or on the number of licensed drivers in each state. Online, NHTSA has posted state-by-state rates of alcohol-impaired driving fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled for 2005 through 2008. We checked the rates over those years for the 10 states that had the most alcohol-impaired driving fatalities in 2009--and found that Texas's rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, ranging from .55 in 2007 to a high of .59 in 2006, exceeded that of all but one of the states. South Carolina's rate, ranging from .81 in 2008 to .91 in 2007, was higher every year. The federal agency also provides information on the number of licensed drivers by state as of 2008. We divided the number of alcohol-impaired driving deaths in each state for that year by its licensed driver total. According to the resulting ratios, Texas ranked 9th nationally in alcohol-impaired driving deaths that year. States with higher ratios were topped by Wyoming, followed by Mississippi, South Carolina, Montana, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota and West Virginia. We also wondered how Texas compares in alcohol-related driving deaths when population is taken into account. We divided the 2009 alcohol-impaired driving deaths for each state by U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for each state. Result: Texas trailed 15 states in deaths per resident. States with higher ratios, led by Wyoming, included North Dakota, Montana, South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Dakota, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, New Mexico, Kansas, Delaware and Missouri. So, it looks like Texas is not No. 1 for drunk driving deaths by every measure. Still, Fette suggested, no matter how you look at the stats on alcohol-impaired driving deaths in Texas, the news isn't good. ""If all of the measures rank at the top or nearly at the top, no matter what the (state's) rank is, it's a serious problem that deserves attention,"" he said. Our take: Several statistical approaches show Texas behind other states in the rate of alcohol-related driving deaths. But it's also reasonable to focus on the sheer number of deaths linked to drunk driving. We rate Acevedo's statement .",true,"Drugs, Public Safety, Texas, Art Acevedo, "
519,27076,"A video shows small, white worms inside some cherries.","July 3, 2019","Both home and commercial farmers take precautions to prevent cherry fruit flies from contaminating their crops. As we have yet to see any information about a recall or public statements regarding a cherry fly infestation, the viral video of maggots in cherries likely captured a relatively isolated incident.",Dan Evon,"On June 26, 2019, a video supposedly showing small, white worms inside of a batch of cherries went viral on social media:  This video, which was viewed millions of times within a week of its initial posting, drew plenty of reactions from viewers who were shocked and disgusted at the apparently sight of maggots in the fruit. While we won’t argue about the gross-out factor of this clip, finding worms in cherries (or other pieces of fruit) isn’t all that unusual. The video likely documents a subject familiar to cherry farmers, the larvae of the cherry fruit fly (Rhagoletis cerasi). Washington State University’s Tree Fruit Website labels the western cherry fruit fly as a “key pest in all cherry growing regions of the western United States.” A photograph from the website showing the fruit flies’ larvae in the flesh of a cherry resembles the images seen in the viral video:  When someone asked the Department of Horticulture at Iowa State University for the best way to get rid of the “white worms in my cherries,” the university responded as follows: The small, white “worms” are probably the larvae of the cherry fruit fly (Rhagoletis spp.). Cherry fruit flies lay eggs on developing cherry fruit in May. Damaged fruit appear shrunken and shriveled when ripe, and usually contain one off-white larva (maggot) that is slightly longer than one-quarter of an inch. Cherry fruit fly damage varies greatly from year to year. It may be more practical to tolerate some damage and loss of usable fruit than to attempt effective preventive control. To prevent maggots from appearing inside the fruit, the tree must be thoroughly sprayed with a labeled insecticide when the adults emerge and before the females lay their eggs inside the young fruit. Because the flies emerge over an extended period of time, several sprays will be needed. You can monitor fruit flies with yellow sticky traps hung in the tree in early May. Check traps daily after the first fruit fly is caught and repeat the spray application until flies no longer appear. Effective home orchard type sprays can be purchased at your local garden center. Carefully read and follow label directions. The cherry fruit fly isn’t the only insect to deposit its larvae in cherries, and this viral video might also show the larvae of the spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii): The spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii) is a relatively new pest of cherries and other soft fleshy fruits (strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, etc). Unlike other vinegar flies that attack rotting or fermenting fruit, the spotted wing attacks maturing fruit. The name spotted wing drosophila comes from the single black spot at the tip of each wing of the male adult. Don’t think though that you will be able to identify this fly by those markings without magnification because these adults are small, really small. The female is able to penetrate the skin of the fruit to lay her eggs and this act creates a small depression (“sting”) on the fruit surface. The eggs hatch and the maggots develop and feed inside the fruit, causing the flesh of the fruit to turn brown and soft. A video published in the peer-reviewed BMC Journal shows the larvae of the fruit fly D. suzukii in a ripe cherry:   Larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila suzukii in a ripe cherry — this species has become a substantial pest species in Europe and the USA. For more on how this species has evolved to be able to feed on ripe fruit, while its sister species can only feed on rotting fruit. While we certainly wouldn’t recommend eating these white worms with your cherries, Garden Guru Pat Welsh noted that accidentally consuming one shouldn’t consitute a health emergency: “The larvae of Western cherry fruit fly don’t harm human beings who have accidentally ingested them since they are not adapted to living in human intestines, and they are mainly, after all, made up of cherry meat, but it is certainly a disgusting thought to know you have been eating worms.”",true,Fauxtography
520,35560,Dr. Anthony Fauci wrote in a 2005 paper published in Virology Journal that hydroxychloroquine was effective in treating SARS. ,"August 4, 2020","As mentioned earlier, the above-displayed screenshot shows an excerpt from an opinion piece written by Fischer, which was published on websites such as One News Now and the conspiratorial True Pundit, a site that traffics in misinformation.",Dan Evon,"In July 2020, social media users posted a meme that included a screenshot of an article excerpt that allegedly demonstrated hydroxychloroquine would be an effective “cure and vaccine” against COVID-19. The claim stems from an opinion piece by Bryan Fischer, former director of the American Family Association, that interpreted a 2005 study on the utility of chloroquine to treat SARS as being relevant to COVID-19 — a disease that did not exist at the time of that paper’s publication. SARS (aka SARS-CoV, which caused epidemics in the early 2000s) and COVID-19 (aka SARS-CoV-2) are both caused by coronaviruses, but that does not mean that both could be treated with the same medication. Similarly, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are related drugs, but that does not mean they are interchangeable. Finally, the excerpted study was limited in scope and based on laboratory results. Fischer attempted to tie Dr. Anthony Fauci to the 2005 study by falsely alleging that it was published in a journal run by the U.S. agency Fauci heads. Are SARS and COVID-19 the same? No. While SARS and COVID-19 are both coronaviruses, that does not mean these two diseases are interchangeable, nor that they can be treated with identical medicines. Hundreds of coronaviruses exist, most of which circulate among animals. These viruses occasionally jump to humans and cause diseases that range in severity. The common cold, for instance, which isn’t particularly known for being lethal, can be caused by a coronavirus. On the other hand, COVID-19, which has caused more than 150,000 deaths in the United States (and close to 700,000 total deaths worldwide) as of this writing, is also caused by a coronavirus. Nobody would argue that a treatment for the common cold would be equally effective against COVID-19. Fischer attempts to dismiss the fact that SARS and COVID-19 are two distinct diseases by arguing that they share a similar scientific name (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2) and 79% of the same genome. Saying that these two diseases share 79% of their genome sequence may make it sound like these diseases are nearly identical, but consider this: Humans share 98% of our genome with chimpanzees. Are hydroxycloroquine and chloroquine the same thing? No. Although these drugs are similar (they are both derivatives of a 4-aminoquinoline [4AQ] nucleus), they aren’t interchangeable. Chloroquine is primarily used to treat malaria, while hydroxychloroquine, which is considered less toxic than chloroquine, is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and certain blood disorders. CNN writes: Chloroquine is used to treat malaria, as well as in chemoprophylaxis, which is the administering of drugs to prevent the development of disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2006, it has not been recommended for use in severe malaria because of problems with resistance, particularly in the Oceania region, according to the World Health Organization. […] Hydroxychloroquine is what’s known as an analog of chloroquine, meaning the two have similar structures but different chemical and biological properties. The former is considered the less toxic derivative, according to studies. It’s given to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and the blood disorder porphyria cutanea tarda, the CDC said. Did this study prove that chloroquine was an effective treatment against SARS? No. The 2005 article published in Virology Journal was based on a laboratory cell-culture experiment that used primate cells, not human cells. The authors noted at the time that more testing was needed before antivirals could be developed to treat the disease in humans: Chloroquine has been widely used to treat human diseases, such as malaria, amoebiosis, HIV, and autoimmune diseases, without significant detrimental side effects [15]. Together with data presented here, showing virus inhibition in cell culture by chloroquine doses compatible with patient treatment, these features suggest that further evaluation of chloroquine in animal models of SARS-CoV infection would be warranted as we progress toward finding effective antivirals for prevention or treatment of the disease. It should also be noted that this was an in vitro study, meaning that it was conducted in a controlled environment, like a test tube, not inside a living organism. The Universal Health Network, a medical research organization in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, noted that in vitro models have a reputation of being “less translatable” to humans than other research methods: A major drawback is their failure to capture the inherent complexity of organ systems. For example, in vitro models may not account for interactions between cells and biochemical processes that occur during turnover and metabolism. As a result, in vitro studies have developed a reputation for being “less translatable” to humans. More importantly, in the years since the SARS outbreak in 2002, chloroquine has not been widely used to treat the disease. Did this study say that hydroxychloroquine was an effective treatment against SARS? No. The 2005 paper in the Virology Journal never mentions hydroxychloroquine. Was Fauci or the NIH involved in this 2005 paper? No.",false,"Medical, COVID-19, Editor's Picks"

There’s a quick, penalty-free fix for anyone who wants out of Obamacare’s health insurance requirement, says conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer. Just check a box. The one that says ""hardship."" That’s it, you’re done! There will be no questions, and no consequences. At least, that’s how easy Krauthammer made it sound during his April 1 appearance on The O’Reilly Factor. He and host Bill O’Reilly discussed the Democrats’ changes to the law since it passed in 2010. Krauthammer: ""They decide what the law is every Wednesday morning. They've changed it 38 times. The employer mandate is out. Remember the great debate in the country for two years over the individual mandate? ""The individual mandate no longer exists. They haven't said so officially, but if you want out of the individual mandate, do you know what you've got to do? ""You have to say that this is a hardship. There are hardship exceptions. It means, it was meant to mean, if there's a hurricane or a tornado and you're living out of the back of a pickup truck, you can opt out. All you have to do now is tick off the box that says 'hardship' and you're out."" O'Reilly: ""Yes, you don't even have to explain it."" Krauthammer: ""You don't have to explain --"" O'Reilly: ""And it can be as simple as 'I don't know how to work the computer, so I can't get it.' "" Krauthammer: ""Right. When you have an anonymous bureaucratic computerized system and then you use the word 'honor system' as the way of describing, you are deliberately misusing the language."" O’Reilly: ""I think the evidence is overwhelming that you are correct."" With an assurance like that from O’Reilly, we thought Krauthammer’s point merited a second look. Is it really so easy to get out of the insurance mandate by claiming a hardship? We know from a previous fact-check that the Internal Revenue Service cannot use the threat of jail time or property seizures to go after people who do not pony up the ""shared responsibility payment,"" or what’s sometimes referred to as the ""tax"" for not having health insurance even though you can afford it. That fee, which will be collected in 2015 for the filing of 2014 taxes, is 1 percent of annual income or $95 per person for the year, whichever is more expensive. The fee goes up every year. Already, some people are exempt for reasons including religious beliefs, prisoners, Indian tribes, income being below the federal filing level, and undocumented immigrants. The hardship exemption comes in when you don’t fall into those categories but have a reason for not having health insurance and paying the fine. In most cases, it’s because you can’t afford it. Getting one is not as easy as checking a box. Here’s the application from the Health Insurance Marketplace, which spells out 14 categories for the hardship exemption. It also says what form of documentation (hello, proof) you need to attach in order to qualify. Categories that require some form of documentation include being evicted or declaring bankruptcy in the last six months; receiving a shut-off notice from a utility; the death of a loved one; a human or natural disaster caused substantial property damage; racking up unexpected costs taking care of a family member; applying for but not receiving Medicaid because the state of residence did not expand Medicaid access envisioned in the law; and having medical expenses you couldn’t pay in the last two years. There’s also a hardship category for people whose health plans were canceled and they find other options unaffordable. Being homeless or suffering domestic abuse are the only categories that do not require some form of documentation. But then there’s the 14th category: ""You experienced another hardship in obtaining health insurance."" Documentation should be submitted ""if possible."" Is that the magical ""other"" category promising safe haven for people who don’t want to pay the insurance penalty? ""Exemption 14 is broad, but not open ended,"" said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University professor who has studied the law. ""My understanding is that it is meant to give (Health and Human Services) the discretion to take into account hardships not specifically listed."" An unlisted hardship would have to be in the spirit of the other categories, he said, and it would not be permanent, if it’s granted at all. The Department of Health and Human Services will respond within one to two weeks to let someone know if more information is needed, the application says. If the exemption is okayed, the recipient gets a special number to include on his or her tax return. ""HHS could certainly deny a hardship exemption if there was insufficient documentation or explanation,"" Jost said. Gail Wilensky, an expert on the law who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said Krauthammer’s point isn’t that far from the mark, especially since ""the administration has shown itself to be extremely 'flexible' when it comes to any type of enforcement or timing thus far."" Still, there is some explaining required. There’s a box for applicants to describe how their hardship prevented them from getting health insurance, with exceptions for people turned down for Medicaid and health policy cancellations (which are proven by copies of a denial for Medicaid or notice of cancellation). People who submit hardship exemptions without really needing one should pay special attention to step three of the application. That’s the part where you sign, under penalty of perjury, that your exemption claim is honest. Lying is a crime. ""Only people who have a true, factual basis for their claims should be advised to file,"" said Sara Rosenbaum, George Washington University health and policy professor. Our ruling Krauthammer said people who don’t want to comply with the individual mandate should just ""tick off the box that says ‘hardship’ and you're out."" He is over-simplifying the process.

The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",Lauren Carroll,"While it’s highly unlikely that Ebola will make it to the United States, the pandemic has wormed its way into one of the most contentious U.S. Senate races -- in Arkansas. Despite the fears of many Americans, experts on infectious diseases -- including the Centers for Disease Control -- say there is a very, very low likelihood that the United States would experience an Ebola outbreak. Compared to west Africa, America has well-resourced health care services, as well as federal programs and agencies dedicated to preventing public health crises in the United States. But that’s no thanks to Rep. Tom Cotton, says incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Pryor in his most recent ad. Pryor’s running against Cotton, a Republican, to keep his seat. ""Tom Cotton voted against preparing America for pandemics like Ebola,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""Congressman Cotton voted to cut billions from our nation’s medical disaster and emergency programs. He was the only Arkansas congressman to vote this way. Just like he was the only one to vote against Children’s Hospital. Instead, Cotton voted massive tax cuts for billionaires. Not protect our families’ health and safety."" As a tea party Republican, Cotton has a history of voting against federal government spending, including spending on disaster relief. But tying Cotton to a potential Ebola outbreak caught our attention. The vote This year, Ebola has killed more than 1,400 people in west Africa as of Aug. 20 and is the largest ever recorded outbreak, according to the World Health Organization. No cases have been recorded in the United States, though two American health care workers contracted the virus while in Liberia and were treated in an Atlanta hospital. We asked Pryor’s campaign for evidence backing up their claim, and they said the ad refers to the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013. The law -- passed in March 2013 -- continues funding various medical and public health emergency preparedness programs through 2018. (The first iteration of the law was passed in 2006.) As you might guess from the name, the law pertains to preventing pandemics, like Ebola, from breaking out in the United States. Several programs funded under the act are already working on Ebola response, such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, said Gretchen Michaels, a spokeswoman for the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services). Additionally, the law’s 2013 reauthorization gave the Food and Drug Administration the ability to authorize use of unapproved products in the case of an emergency. So earlier this month, the FDA authorized use of a new tool for diagnosing Ebola, as well as an experimental treatment. Did Cotton try to stop this legislation? At first, it seems that way. The House passed the legislation Jan. 22, 2013, with strong bipartisan support and very little opposition -- 395 to 29. Cotton voted against it, along with 28 other Republicans. The bill moved on to the Senate, where lawmakers made a few changes, passed it by a voice vote, and sent it back to the House to approve the changes. The House once again passed the Senate’s version of the bill with an overwhelming majority from both parties. This time around, Cotton changed his position and voted for the bill. (Seven other Republicans who previously voted ""nay"" also changed their vote.) It’s not clear why Cotton didn’t vote for it the first time. The law passed with such little debate that it went over without much media attention. We reached out to Cotton’s campaign but haven’t heard back -- though they posted an article on their website refuting the claim. According to CQ Weekly, the major difference between the House and Senate version of the act is that the House version approves funding and programs through 2017, while the Senate version goes through 2018. We also used a tool to compare differences between the two texts and found that the final version includes a clause clarifying that state and local workers asked to temporarily take on a different assignment in case of an emergency would not be required to accept that reassignment. Regardless, the country’s ability to address a pandemic does not hinge on either of those changes. There is no readily available evidence showing that Cotton actively campaigned against the bill. And the final version, which got Cotton’s vote, also got positive votes from nearly every Senate and House Democrat -- including Pryor.

Ralph Northam battled against widespread criticism and calls for him to resign his office. A scandal emerged on 1 February when the Virginian-Pilot newspaper published a photograph obtained from Northam’s 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook page, which showed one man in “blackface” and another wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood. Northam apologized but resisted calls for him to leave office. By the time the yearbook scandal erupted, Northam had already become embroiled in controversy after comments he made about abortion during a live radio interview on Washington, D.C.’s, WTOP radio just two days earlier. On 5 February, President Donald Trump himself attacked Northam’s abortion remarks during the State of the Union address, claiming the Virginia governor had “stated he would execute a baby after birth”:  In reality, Northam did not say he would “execute a baby after birth,” but the exact meaning of everything he did say was not entirely clear. The full video of the governor’s WTOP interview is available here, and a transcript of the most relevant section follows. Understanding the full context of his remarks is important to this issue. In early January, Delegate Kathy Tran, a Democratic member of the Virginia Assembly, introduced House Bill 2491, which would have lessened legal restrictions on second- and third-trimester abortions. Of particular note, the measure would have reduced from three to one the number of doctors required to certify that a third-trimester abortion was necessary to prevent a pregnant woman from dying or experiencing physical or mental harm, and it would have eliminated an existing requirement that such harm be certified as “substantial and irremediable.” During a 28 January Courts and Justice subcommittee hearing, Tran faced a series of questions from Republican subcommittee Chairman Todd Gilbert about the provisions of her bill and their potential implications. In one instance, Gilbert asked Tran whether her bill would, in theory, allow a doctor to certify that a woman’s mental health was at risk from continuing a pregnancy, even at the point where she was about to give birth, and whether House Bill 2491 would make it legally permissible to perform an abortion at that stage. Tran agreed that her bill would permit that. The legislation was voted down in the committee and therefore was not passed by Virginia legislators, but video footage of the exchange between Tran and Gilbert prompted outrage among pro-life commentators and in national news news coverage:  That was the background for a question put to Northam two days later on WTOP radio, when WRC-TV’s Julie Carey asked him whether he supported Tran’s proposals. The following is a transcript of the relevant exchange, which can be watched in the video embedded below: Julie Carey: … There was a very contentious committee hearing yesterday when Fairfax County Delegate Kathy Tran made her case for lifting restrictions on third-trimester abortions, as well as other restrictions now in place. And she was pressed by a Republican delegate about whether her bill would permit an abortion even as a woman is, essentially, dilating, ready to give birth. And she answered that it would permit an abortion at that stage of labor. Do you support her measure? And explain her answer. Ralph Northam: You know, I wasn’t there, Julie, and I certainly can’t speak for Delegate Tran, but I would tell you — one, the first thing I would say is this is why decisions such as this should be made by [healthcare] providers, physicians, and the mothers and fathers that are involved. There are — you know when we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of, obviously, the mother, with the consent of the physicians, more than one physician by the way. And it’s done in cases where there may be severe deformities, there may be a fetus that’s non-viable. So in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother. So I think this was really blown out of proportion …  Northam’s remarks prompted an immediate backlash, with some right-leaning and pro-life observers claiming that he had expressed support for infanticide (i.e., the intentional killing of a child). President Trump, in his State of the Union address, went even further in stripping away the nuance and context from what Northam said and described the comments even more provocatively by claiming: “He [Northam] stated he would execute a baby after birth.” Northam certainly did not say that, but the exact meaning of his remarks was unclear. The governor invoked a “particular example,” but did not make it clear what the parameters of that example were. Was Northam describing a hypothetical scenario under current Virginia law, or under what would be the legal milieu if Tran’s bill were passed? Did the example he used involve a fetus given a late diagnosis of disability or of a fatal condition, which meant the fetus was “non-viable” and could not survive even after being delivered alive? When Northam said the fetus would be “resuscitated if that’s what the mother and family desired,” was he saying he would, hypothetically, support a decision to allow the fetus to die by not providing life-extending medical intervention? What would be an acceptable outcome, in his view, to the “discussion” that would then take place between the woman and her physicians, and was Northam giving tacit support to a decision whereby a physician would withdraw life-extending care or take actions to intentionally end the life of the fetus? We put this list of detailed questions to Northam’s office in order to clarify the exact meaning of his remarks to WTOP on 30 January but did not receive a response in time for publication. Vox quoted a spokesperson for Northam as saying that the governor’s comments were “absolutely not” a reference to infanticide but rather “focused on the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe abnormalities went into labor.” Also, according to NBC News, a spokesperson for Northam “disputed [President Trump’s] characterization” of his comments but did not provide any further clarifying details. It’s clear that Northam did not “state he would execute a baby after birth,” as Trump claimed he did. However, his remarks did lack precision and clarity of meaning to the extent that they raised reasonable questions about what exactly he was proposing or advocating.”",false,"Politics, abortion, donald trump"

The 2019 coronavirus is a new virus that had not been previously identified. Most cases of the 2019 coronavirus have been mild, but it’s been lethal for some people.",Bill McCarthy,"Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh accused the media of overhyping the 2019 coronavirus that’s infected nearly 80,000 people worldwide, calling it ""the common cold"" and claiming, without evidence, that it’s ""being weaponized"" as an attack on President Donald Trump. ""It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump,"" Limbaugh said Feb. 24 on his radio show. ""Now, I want to tell you the truth about the coronavirus … I’m dead right on this. The coronavirus is the common cold, folks."" ""The drive-by media hype up this thing as a pandemic,"" Limbaugh continued. ""Ninety-eight percent of people who get the coronavirus survive. It’s a respiratory system virus."" The recent Presidential Medal of Freedom winner went on to push the debunked conspiracy theory that the new coronavirus strain was created in a lab as a bioweapon. But we were also struck by his claim that the 2019 coronavirus is nothing more than ""the common cold."" We didn’t have to look far to see where Limbaugh went wrong. In a FAQ about the 2019 coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addressed his confusion head-on. ""A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified,"" the CDC wrote. ""The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not that same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold."" The current strain of coronavirus was first detected in December in Wuhan, China. It’s one of seven types of coronaviruses that can infect humans, according to the CDC. Named for the crown-like spikes on their surface, coronaviruses are typically found in animals such as camels, cattle and bats. Strains infecting humans were discovered in the mid 1960s. But more serious strains have emerged over the last two decades, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which spread across the globe in 2003. According to the CDC, the 2019 coronavirus is a ""beta coronavirus"" similar to SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which was first identified in 2012. All three viruses have their origins in bats, and all three can induce symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath — similar to some common colds. More severe cases can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and death, according to the World Health Organization. A CDC fact-sheet describing common human coronaviruses said most people contract some type of coronavirus during their lives and that the more common strains ""usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold."" But the same fact-sheet also knocked down the idea that the 2019 coronavirus was the exact same as the more common strains. ""This information applies to common human coronaviruses and should not be confused with Coronavirus Disease-2019,"" it said. Limbaugh seems to have been ""mixing up clinical symptoms as defining the disease,"" said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California. ""Many diseases start off with ‘flu-like symptoms’ and progress on to something else,"" Watanabe said, noting that the 2019 coronavirus is part of a different family of viruses than the flu. ""This is a brand new virus,"" he said. ""I think what Rush Limbaugh is referring to is the idea that it is from a family of coronaviruses. That is the family name of these viruses, and some of them in the past have caused systems that were more consistent with the common cold. But it’s also been the same family of viruses that caused SARS, that caused MERS."" Experts from the National Institutes of Health and Penn State University’s College of Medicine drew a line from the spread of the 2019 virus to outbreaks of SARS and MERS in a report titled ""Coronavirus Infections — More Than Just the Common Cold."" According to the WHO, about 80% of 2019 coronavirus patients have recovered from mild symptoms without needing special treatment, while roughly 1 in every 6 people have become ""seriously ill."" About 2% of people have died. (For comparison, the flu — which is more severe than the common cold — has an estimated death rate in the United States of about 0.1%). People who are older or have certain pre-existing health conditions have been more likely to experience serious symptoms, the WHO’s website says. ""There are alpha coronaviruses that cause common cold,"" said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. ""This is a beta coronavirus like SARS and MERS and is approximately 20 to 30 times more deadly than (the) flu."" We follow the facts and share what we learn so you can make your own decisions. Support our mission today. Membership.politifact.com As of Feb. 24, the new coronavirus has spread to 29 countries beyond China, according to the WHO's official count.

She is right. Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease, and the CDC gives this exact timeframe on its website.",Katie Sanders,"The paid medical experts of TV channels are seeing a lot of time on the airwaves lately as they diagnose the country’s measles flare-up. It wasn’t too long ago that they were explaining risks of the Ebola virus killing thousands of Western Africans and the chances it could spread throughout the United States. This time around, the health pundits have spent considerable time spelling out the differences between the two scary diseases. Ebola, which has a low risk of spreading through the United States, is passed through direct contact with bodily fluids and not through the air. Measles, which was eliminated from the United States in 2000 due to wide vaccination, is a very different virus, explained CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. Unlike Ebola, ""you don’t need to be that close to someone or kiss someone or anything like that"" to pass it around. ""It’s airborne,"" she told Anderson Cooper on Feb. 2. ""If someone is in a room that has measles and leaves and you walk in two hours later, you could get measles from that person."" We thought her example sounded alarming. So, after checking our personal immunization histories, we decided to fact-check her statement. We didn’t hear back from Cohen when we reached out to CNN, but we found information from a reliable source that backs up her scenario. Her example is nearly exactly the transmission description for measles from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The measles virus stays in the nose and throat mucus of someone who has the infection, so it makes sense that it is passed around through coughing and sneezing. ""Also, measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed,"" the CDC says. ""If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected."" Physicians encourage the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine because it is very effective in preventing the virus from entering the body (and as we found, the science is certain that it is safe). The disease is so easy to catch, the CDC says, that if one person catches it, a whopping 90 percent of people who are not immune (i.e. did not have the vaccine due to a weak immune system, age or personal choice) close to the infected person will also become infected. We can compare the contagion of each disease by examining the basic reproductive number, known as the R0. This refers to the average number of secondary infection cases stemming from one infected person in a ""completely susceptible"" uninfected population (if the population is vaccinated for, say, measles, the R0 basically disappears). As the R0 increases above 1, the disease spreads more widely. The R0 of Ebola is around 2, meaning an average of two people catch the disease from one infected person during an outbreak. The measles has a much higher R0 of 18, higher than AIDS (R0 of 4), SARS (R0 of 4), or mumps (R0 of 10). NPR’s Shots blog has a great chart breaking down this concept. Put another way, ""Ebola's got nothing"" on the measles epidemic, wrote Dr. Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center, in a recent Houston Chronicle opinion-editorial. ""Just being in the room where someone with measles has been 30 minutes earlier can expose you,"" Troisi wrote. Troisi confirmed the accuracy of Cohen’s statement. When we asked about the discrepancy between her 30-minute window and Cohen’s two-hour window, she directed us to the CDC’s website and called her estimate ""conservative."" Our ruling Cohen said, ""If someone is in a room that has measles and leaves and you walk in two hours later, you could get measles from that person."" She is right.

Simmons initially pleaded not guilty to all 14 charges, but has changed his plea to guilty for the second count — “evasion of payment of income taxes.”",Dan MacGuill,"In February 2018, rumors spread online that the 47-year-old rapper DMX had died. The speculation was partly fuelled by a widely-shared prank Facebook post, and partly by confusion over older reports about an alleged drug overdose. As of 16 February 2018, DMX is alive. At the time of publication, the rapper and producer (whose real name is Earl Simmons) is incarcerated at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, after being remanded into custody on 30 January, in connection with felony tax evasion charges. Speaking to us by phone, Simmons’s attorney Murray Richman confirmed that his client is alive and well, and that he had met and spoken with him more than once during the week of 12 February 2018. Asked whether DMX had fallen ill or been hospitalized recently, Richman said “he certainly has not.” The celebrity gossip web site TMZ reported that Simmons had violated the conditions of his probation by consuming alcohol and narcotics while visiting St. Louis, Missouri, where he had performed on 20 January. Court records show that on 30 January 2018, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff ordered DMX to be remanded into custody, and prison records show that he was incarcerated at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, as of 16 February 2018. Simmons’s probation conditions mean he must undergo drug rehabilitation treatment, and ask the judge for special permission any time he wants to leave the state of New York. While travelling, he must be accompanied by a drug counsellor. On 13 February 2018, Facebook user Tyrone Williams posted a distasteful prank death notice for the rapper, writing: Earl Simmons AKA “DMX” peacefully passed by a home in Los Angeles, California. Feb 13, 2018. The post was shared more than 50,000 times within a few days. Williams later confirmed the post was a fake, pointing out that he had not (technically speaking) claimed Simmons was dead. Reading is very fundamental 💯 A few thousand people think DMX is dead right now smh. I never even mentioned death or him dying in the post. The post claims DMX “passed by,” not passed away. Adding to the confusion, concerned DMX fans began sharing news articles which reported that he had been hospitalized after a drug overdose. However, those reports are two years old. In February 2016, Simmons was resuscitated by police officers after being found unconscious outside a hotel in Yonkers, New York. Witnesses claimed he had had a drug overdose, but Simmons and his family denied this, claiming he had suffered an asthma attack.",false,"Entertainment, celebrity death hoax, dmx, hip hop"
535,35156,"U.S. President Barack Obama waited until millions were infected and thousands were dead before declaring a public health emergency concerning swine flu, the H1N1 virus. ","March 2, 2020","The declaration, signed Friday night and announced Saturday, comes with the disease more prevalent than ever in the country and production delays undercutting the government’s initial, optimistic estimates that as many as 120 million doses of the vaccine could be available by mid-October.",Dan Evon,"On Feb. 28, 2020, the website PJ Media published an article claiming that U.S. President Barack Obama had waited until millions were infected and thousands were dead from swine flu, the H1N1 virus, before declaring a public health emergency in 2009. The article, which was presented as a “fact check,” got several simple details wrong. In response to criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump’s handling of a recent outbreak of a new coronavirus, the PJ Media article opined that Obama had been lackadaisical about his response to a health emergency back in 2009, and that Trump by comparison had done his job admirably. PJ Media writes: Surely, St. Barack of Obama would have dealt with this horrible pandemic better than Orange Man Bad, right? No-Drama-Obama had this whole thing under control, of course! Well, let’s compare and contrast… Now, let’s go to the Wayback Machine. In April of 2009, the H1N1 became a pandemic. But it wasn’t until six months later, October, that then-President Obama declared a public health emergency on what was already a pandemic. By that time, the disease had infected millions of Americans and more than 1,000 people had died in the U.S. There are several factual inaccuracies in this excerpt alone. For instance, PJ media writes that H1N1 became a pandemic in April 2009. But that’s not the case. The disease emerged in April but wasn’t declared a pandemic until June. The excerpt also claims that Obama “declared a public health emergency on what was already a pandemic” in October 2009. But this is also wrong. Obama declared a national emergency, not a public health emergency, in October 2009. The Obama administration declared a public health emergency in April, months before swine flu was declared a pandemic. At the time that the Obama administration declared a public health emergency, only 20 confirmed cases (not over a million) of H1N1 existed in the United States. The New York Times reported on April 26, 2009: Responding to what some health officials feared could be the leading edge of a global pandemic emerging from Mexico, American health officials declared a public health emergency on Sunday as 20 cases of swine flu were confirmed in this country, including eight in New York City. […] The emergency declaration in the United States lets the government free more money for antiviral drugs and give some previously unapproved tests and drugs to children. One-quarter of the national stockpile of 50 million courses of antiflu drugs will be released. PJ Media also inaccurately presented a video in the article as if it showed Obama addressing the swine flu after it had “already become a pandemic.” Again, that simply isn’t the case. When Obama addressed the nation about swine flu, or H1N1, in April 2009, the disease was just starting to spread. It wouldn’t be until June 2009 that the swine flu would be declared a pandemic. Here’s Obama’s April 2009 address: The swine flu pandemic spread quickly across the United States starting in April 2009. There were approximately 60 million cases over the course of the following year, which resulted in nearly 275,000 hospitalizations and more than 12,000 deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a detailed timeline of this pandemic on its website. It shows that the CDC first activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) on April 22, 2009. At the time, there were only two confirmed cases in the United States. On April 25, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern, and the following day the Obama administration did the same. At that time, there were about 20 confirmed cases. Despite the CDC’s efforts, the swine flu continued to spread. Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of health and human services, renewed the emergency declaration on July 24, 2009, and then again on Oct. 1, 2009. On Oct. 24, 2009, Obama declared a national emergency that gave officials more resources to fight the pandemic. The Associated Press reported: President Barack Obama has declared the swine flu outbreak a national emergency, giving his health chief the power to let hospitals move emergency rooms offsite to speed treatment and protect noninfected patients.",false,"Politics, COVID-19"

This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First of all, as of March 3, it doesn’t appear that there are any confirmed cases in Mississippi of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The Mississippi State Department of Health website says ""there are currently no cases of COVID-19 in Mississippi."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that there are 60 confirmed cases in the U.S. in 12 states as of March 3, but Mississippi is not one of them. Because COVID-19 is a new disease, researchers are still learning about how it spreads. But according to the CDC, the virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person, either between people within sixfeet of each other or through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It’s also possible that someone could get COVID-19 by touching something that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes, but the CDC says this isn’t the main way the virus spreads. Noreen Hynes, director of the John Hopkins Geographic Medicine Center, told PolitiFact in an email that talking — especially when saying words with the letters ""t"" or ""d"" — could also spread the droplets that can cause infection when they come into contact with the mucous membranes of someone’s eyes, nose or mouth. The spread of coronavirus via such droplets has been documented. Airborne transmission has not been documented but, Hynes said, it ""has been hypothesized to occur."" Hynes explained that ""airborne transmission"" refers to when residue from evaporated respiratory droplets contains a microorganism and can linger suspended in the air for a long time. ""The organism on such droplet nuclei, as they are called, must be capable of surviving for a long time outside the body and must be resistant to drying,"" Hynes said. ""Such droplet nuclei act like a gas, allowing organisms to enter both the upper and lower respiratory tract. Diseases associated with airborne transmission include measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis."" But the University of California San Francisco says in a Feb. 13 post on its website that the new coronavirus ""isn’t believed to be an airborne virus, like measles or smallpox, that can circulate through the air."" Charles Chiu, a doctor who studies infectious diseases at the university, is quoted in the post as saying: ""If you have an infected person in the front of the plane, for instance, and you’re in the back of the plane, your risk is close to zero simply because the area of exposure is thought to be roughly six feet from the infected person."" There’s a difference between viruses that are transmitted by droplets and things that are aerosolized and float around in the air, according to University of Chicago Medicine. The school puts it like this: ""Think of droplets as small bits of fluid that you can see and feel when someone sneezes. You sneeze or cough and these droplets get on surfaces and then you touch them and get them on your hands, or they can fly right into your mouth or nose or eyes. That’s how most coronaviruses are transmitted and that’s how we think this one is too."" Now consider an aerosol — like hairspray. You may still be able to smell it a while after someone has used it because it’s lingering in the air, according to the school: ""Obviously we’re learning a lot about this virus, but most coronaviruses aren’t airborne this way. Generally speaking, there may be times when some of these droplets or particles are airborne, but it’s limited."" Our ruling The Facebook post says a woman in Mississippi was infected by the coronavirus and that it was airborne. We’re still learning about the coronavirus and how it spreads, but this isn’t accurate. Currently, there are no confirmed cases in Mississippi, and while it has been suggested that coronavirus could be airborne, it hasn’t been documented to spread that way. Rather, the virus’s spread has been documented via respiratory droplets mainly when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

In an extremely short September 21 2020 blog post by PJ Media (“WATCH: Joe Biden Just Completely Botched the Pledge of Allegiance”) the site embedded Guest’s tweet and claimed:During a campaign speech on Monday [September 21 2020], Joe Biden attempted to quote the Pledge of Allegiance, and instead delivered a jumbled version of it, saying, “I pledge allegiance to the United States of America, one nation, indivisible, under God, for real.”I suppose he’ll want credit for including “under God,” but I suspect he only included it because Trump has been calling out the Democrats for excluding it during their convention.Although the post was very short, PJ Media managed to shoehorn in reference to a previous viral falsehood, holding that Democrats struck out the phrase “Under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance at the 2020 Democratic National Convention (DNC):Did Dems Strike ‘Under God’ from the Pledge of Allegiance at the 2020 DNC?In the course of that fact check, we obtained video of the opening portion from all three nights of the August 2020 DNC. “Under God” was recited as part of the pledge in all three official ceremony openings, and on one of the nights, it was also followed directly by a lengthy prayer:Almighty God, we confess that our nation needs you and has always needed you.

In actuality, he was not reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, but rather referencing its content in the course of making a larger set of remarks.Biden said, in part:“Just a few days ago when I was asked about the death count approaching 200,000, the president said, and I quote, he said — I won’t quote him. The president said if you take out the blue states run by Democratic governors and just look at the red states, Republican governors are doing quite well.“Now, of course, it’s a simple factual matter, it’s just not true. If you just count all the deaths in the red states, we are number two in the world in deaths just behind Brazil. But more fundamentally it reflects on the part of Donald Trump that he has a deeply flawed and divisive view of the United States, this nation and the job he holds.“Think about what he’s saying.“He’s saying if you live in a state like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, states with Democratic governors, you’re not his problem. He has no obligation to you. He’s not responsible for you as president, your family or your well-being.“I don’t see the presidency that way. I don’t pledge allegiance to red states of America or blue states of America. I pledge allegiance to the United States of America, one nation, indivisible, under God, for real.“Biden concluded, reiterating his broader point:“I’m running as a proud Democrat. But I’m not going to govern as a Democratic president, I’m going to governor as president. I get criticized for saying that sometimes to some in my party, but that’s not what I’m going to do. I’m going to fight as hard for those who supported me as those who did not support me.“This is not a partisan moment, for God’s sake, this has to be an American moment. In the next few weeks, we have a chance to put anger and division and the darkness that’s overtaken this country behind us. We have to put it behind us. I know I’ve been criticized since I entered the primaries about what I said about uniting the country.“We have to unite the country. This is not who we are. And we can.

540,30132,Left-wing protesters vandalized the home of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.,"October 2, 2018","Abcnews.live is a spoof website attempting to earn clicks and ad revenue off the name and reputation of ABC News. Its content appears to consist mostly, if not entirely, of material republished from America’s Last Line of Defense.",David Emery,"On 30 September 2018, the same day a real act of vandalism connected to sexual assault accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was reported at the Republican Party headquarters in Rockford, Illinois, false reports emerged saying Kavanaugh’s family home had also been vandalized. The reports, published on the websites America’s Last Line of Defense (Trumpbetrayed.us) and abcnews.live, and shared widely on social media, said “left-wing protesters” caused at least $11,000 in damage to the residence: The family home of Judge Brett Kavanaugh was a scene right out of a frat party gone wrong yesterday, as over 200 left-wing protesters, many wearing masks, shouted profane slogans, waved signs, and threw calendars, bricks, and bottles at the property. Kavanaugh himself was not in the residence, as he is currently in Washington for a symposium on anger management. His wife and children vacated the premisis [sic] and are currently housed in an unknown location for their own safety. The Judge’s home, located at 1512 Whiteman [sic] Street in Mayo Lake, PA, was deluged early in the morning, at the 9:00 hour, as the protesters arrived by van and poured out onto the sidewalk and lawn areas. Neighbors and witnesses reported screaming and loud “jungle drum-like” noises and local police were notified. Officers were shown protest permits, most signed by Diane Fienstien [sic] and Kamala Harris, and chose to remain at the scene in a public-safety capacity. No charges were filed, and the authorities left the area by noon. It was then that the crowd became riotous, and caused upwards of $11,000 worth of damage. The articles included a photograph allegedly taken by Kavanaugh’s neighbors:  All the image shows is two individuals erasing graffiti from the garage door of a house, however. It pictures no mob of 200 mask-wearing protesters, nor any sign of thrown bricks or bottles, or any other visible evidence of vandalism. As well, no such incident was reported by reliable news sources, including ABC News, despite their logo’s appearance above the article published on abcnews.live. The reason the supposed incident wasn’t mentioned anywhere else is that it was completely fabricated. The Kavanaugh family doesn’t live on “Whiteman Street” in Mayo Lake, Pennsylvania — in fact, there’s no such place as Mayo Lake, Pennsylvania. The image dates from 2016 and originally accompanied an article in the Hamilton Spectator (of Ontario, Canada) concerning an act of vandalism prompted by a neighborhood dispute over the cutting down of a tree.

541,36660,Barack and Michelle Obama were forced to surrender their licenses to practice law because of their unethical behavior.,"October 4, 2018",Were the Obamas Forced to Surrender Their Law Licenses?,  Brooke Binkowski  ,"In early October 2018, many people in the United States and abroad were closely watching the twists and turns around a Supreme Court nomination as multiple women accused the nominee of committing or abetting sexual assault. Almost immediately, bots, trolls, and useful idiots picked up on the controversy, muddying the waters with rumors, gossip, and outright fabrications about his accusers.As the investigation into the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh continued and the discussion about him spiraled into new territory, the usual suspects resurrected a years-old chain email, spreading it across social media.The original looked something like this, although there were some variations as time went on:Barack Obama — Editor of the Harvard Law Review — Has No Law License?I saw a note slide across the #TCOT feed on Twitter last night that mentioned Michelle Obama had no law license. This struck me as odd, since (a) she went to school to be a lawyer, and (b) she just recently held a position with the University of Chicago Hospitals as legal counsel — and that’s a pretty hard job to qualify for without a law license.But being a licensed professional myself, I knew that every state not only requires licensure, they make it possible to check online the status of any licensed professional. So I did, and here’s the results from the ARDC Website:She “voluntarily surrendered” her license in 1993. Let me explain what that means. A “Voluntary Surrender” is not something where you decide “Gee, a license is not really something I need anymore, is it?” and forget to renew your license. No, a “Voluntary Surrender” is something you do when you’ve been accused of something, and you “voluntarily surrender” you license five seconds before the state suspends you.Here’s an illustration: I’m a nurse. At various times in my 28 years of nursing I’ve done other things when I got burned out; most notably a few years as a limousine driver; even an Amway salesman at one point. I always, always renewed my nursing license — simply because it’s easier to send the state $49.00 a month than to pay the $200, take a test, wait six weeks, etc., etc. I’ve worked (recently) in a Nursing Home where there was an 88 year old lawyer and a 95 year old physician. Both of them still had current licensures as well. They would never DREAM of letting their licenses lapse.I happen to know there is currently in the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City Indiana an inmate who is a licensed physician, convicted of murder when he chased the two burglars who entered his home and terrorized his family into the street and killed them. (And I can’t say I blame him for that, either.) This physician still has an active medical license and still sees patients, writes prescriptions, etc all from inside the prison. And he renews his medical license every two years, too. I tried looking up why she would “Voluntarily surrender” her license, but Illinois does not have it’s 1993 records online.But when I searched for “Obama”, I found this:“Voluntarily retired” — what does that mean? Bill Clinton hung onto his law license until he was convicted of making a false statement in the Lewinsky case and had to “Voluntarily Surrender” his license too. President Barack Obama, former editor of the Harvard Law Review, is no longer a “lawyer”. He surrendered his license back in 2008 possibly to escape charges that he “fibbed” on his bar application.This is the former editor of the Harvard Law Review who doesn’t seem to give a crap about his law license.Something else odd; while the Search feature brings up the names, any searches for the Disciplinary actions ends quickly.As in, Too Quickly. Less than a half-second quickly on a Search Engine that can take five seconds to Search for anything. As in, “there’s a block on that information” kind of thing.So we have the first Lawyer President and First Lady — who don’t actually have licenses to practice law. There’s more to this story, I’m sure. I’ll let you know when I find it.Needless to say, in the years since, “more to the story” never appeared.A quick search of the state of Illinois’ Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission website shows that Barack Obama’s law license was changed to “retired” in 2008, when he was elected president (the year before, he had switched it to “voluntarily inactive” in order to focus on his presidential run, and Michelle Obama has been listed as “voluntarily inactive” since 1993, when she left law and entered the public sector. Since then, neither has been embroiled in any sort of scandal that would require them to turn in their (inactive) law licenses.As University of California, Los Angeles law professor Eugene Volokh wrote in 2010 about this very rumor:4. The article continues, “President Barack Obama, former editor of the Harvard Law Review, is no longer a ‘lawyer’. He surrendered his license back in 2008 possibly to escape charges that he ‘fibbed’ on his bar application.” And “possibly” because the Illuminati ordered the Bar to do it, but that’s just empty hypothesizing, with no actual evidence. The fact that someone who doesn’t actually practice law, and is unlikely to practice law, voluntarily retires is hardly a sinister signal: It costs money to be a member of the bar, and if you’re not going to practice, it may make sense to retire. Nor does this somehow undermine claims that he’s a lawyer; a retired lawyer is still commonly called a lawyer — as an indication of what he has studied, and his general professional field — even if he is no longer a member of the bar.5. It then says, “Michelle Obama ‘voluntarily surrendered’ her law license in 1993.” Again, I’m not sure what the quotes mean, but the bar record says that she is “Voluntarily inactive.” This is even more common for lawyers who don’t need a bar card, such as many lawyers who don’t appear in court or counsel clients other than employer. Being an active status lawyer costs more money (see Rule 756) than being inactive, and it requires one to do Continuing Legal Education classes (Rule 790), unless one is in certain jobs for which the CLE requirements are waived). The difference in bar fees, for instance, is why I myself was inactive in 2001. Moreover, it’s pretty easy to switch back to active status should one need to do that (as I did in early 2002); again, in Illinois, see Rule 756.Michelle and Barack Obama are also listed on the Illinois State Bar Association’s official website as honorary members (as are Hillary Clinton and Harper Lee for her portrayal of Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird) which would be extremely strange if they had both lost their licenses in disgrace.While we cannot explain the search engine lag time, we did not experience anything like it during our own tests, suggesting that might be less to do with the engine and more to do with the person conducting the search to begin with.",false,"Disinformation, Fact Checks, Politics"
544,2946,Brain-dead California girl ordered kept on ventilator for week longer.,"December 31, 2013",The family of a California girl who was declared brain dead after complications from a tonsillectomy won an 11th-hour court order on Monday requiring doctors to keep her connected to a breathing machine for at least another week.,Laila Kearney,"Under the latest court order in the case, doctors at Children’s Hospital and Research Center in Oakland are barred from taking 13-year-old Jahi McMath off a ventilator without her family’s consent before 5 p.m. local time on January 7, relatives and hospital officials said. The eight-day extension gives the girl’s relatives, who refuse to accept that she is beyond recovery, more time to complete arrangements to have her transferred to an extended-care facility. But Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evilio Grillo’s decision to extend the previous deadline set in his own restraining order of last week was intended to allow time for appellate review of the case, hospital officials said. “This is a tragedy that has been postponed for another week,” hospital spokesman Sam Singer told reporters outside the hospital after family members announced Monday’s ruling about an hour before Grillo’s original deadline was due to lapse. A person declared brain dead is considered legally and physiologically dead under California law, as is the case in many states, and the hospital’s own statements about Jahi have referred to her as deceased. Grillo acted as the family filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court on Monday asking a federal judge to intervene to keep Jahi connected to the machine that has kept her heart and lungs going for more than two weeks. The lawsuit claimed the hospital’s planned “removal of cardiopulmonary support over the objections” of the girl’s mother, and against her religious principles, amounts to an infringement of religious freedom and privacy rights under the U.S. Constitution. Grillo initially refused last week to extend his restraining order after two pediatric neurologists testified that Jahi had suffered an irreversible loss of all brain activity and was thus medically dead. Family members said they were seeking to have her moved to a licensed long-term treatment center in New York and had raised $20,000 in donations needed to pay for a cross-country airlift. Jahi’s grandmother Sandra Chatman, herself a registered nurse, told reporters outside the hospital Monday afternoon that the girl had started to move her legs and appeared to be responding to voices of loved ones around her. The girl’s uncle Omar Sealey also said Jahi was responding to her mother’s voice and touch and that he had video to prove it. “We have a pediatrician who has seen Jahi who has sworn that she is not dead,” Sealey told reporters. Hospital spokeswoman Melinda Krigel said it was not uncommon for spontaneous twitching or other body movements caused by spinal reflexes to occur in recently deceased individuals. The hospital has said it would not stand in the way of Jahi’s being moved to another facility. But officials there also refused last week to perform additional procedures that might be required, such as placing a tracheotomy and gastric tubes in her body before a transfer. As part of its request for federal court action on Monday, the family asked that the hospital be required to carry out those preparations. The hospital also has said it needs written assurances from a coroner that the transfer would be permitted. Jahi was admitted to Children’s Hospital on December 9 for surgery to remove her tonsils as a means of treating her sleep apnea. Shortly after the procedure, she began to bleed severely, suffered a heart attack and then brain swelling, according to the family’s lawyer, Christopher Dolan. Hospital officials declared her brain dead on December 12. According to medical experts, Jahi’s lungs and heart are only continuing to function because of air being forced in and out of her body by the ventilator, without which her breathing and heartbeat would cease. Unlike an individual in a coma or a vegetative state, Jahi lacks any brain activity whatsoever, rendering her unable to breathe on her own, doctors said. Hospital officials have said the facility and state health officials are investigating how a routine operation led to Jahi’s death and that they understand the family’s anguish. “We have the deepest sympathy for Jahi’s mother who wishes her daughter was alive; but the ventilator cannot reverse the brain death that has occurred, and it would be wrong to give false hope that Jahi will ever come back to life,” Dr. David Durand, the chief of pediatrics, said in a statement.",true,Health News

The department promotes diversity. But there doesn't appear to be a department memo or mandate that employees openly support gay marriage or homosexuality. That said, a subset of workers received a brochure from an agency-sanctioned employee group encouraging managers to respect and support gay workers.",W. Gardner Selby,"President Barack Obama’s administration ""has gone out of its way to thump Christians,"" a Texas U.S. House member said in a July 15, 2013, interview with Fox News. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, went on to say the nation’s top lawyers have been directed to embrace gay marriage, saying: ""It's also been true in the Department of Justice right now, directly under this president, his buddy, Eric Holder. There's a memo that directs that you must openly embrace gay marriage and homosexuality. And silence is considered to be disapproval,"" Gohmert said, according to CQ Transcriptions. The Justice Department required workers to embrace gay marriage and more? Employee group brochure To our email inquiry, Gohmert spokeswoman Kimberly Willingham pointed out a May 28, 2013, blog post by Todd Starnes, a Fox News commentator, headlined: ""DOJ Tells Employees to Verbally Affirm Homosexuality."" Starnes, citing Liberty Counsel, a law firm that says it’s dedicated to ""advancing religious freedom, the sanctity of life, and the family,"" wrote that department employees were emailed a brochure,  ""LGBT Inclusion at Work: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Managers."" He wrote too that the brochure was created by DOJ Pride, an association of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender agency employees. The brochure lists about 20 ""do’s"" and ""don’ts"" running from appropriate language to dealing with offensive jokes to declaring one’s own sexual orientation and respecting someone who does so. Given Gohmert’s statement, we narrowed our focus to brochure references to gay marriage and to embracing homosexuality. Under the heading ""Use Inclusive Language,"" the brochure encourages recipients to ""use inclusive words like ‘partner,’ ‘significant other’ or ‘spouse’ rather than gender-specific terms like ‘husband’ and ‘wife.’"" Another section says: ""Do acknowledge important events in an LGBT employee’s life--e.g., same-sex marriage, birth of a child, illness of a spouse, or death of a partner’s parent--in the same way you would for a heterosexual employee."" A theme of the brochure is respect for an employee’s sexual orientation. A section titled ""Come Out"" says: ""Do let your employees know they’ll be treated with fairness and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, by ‘coming out’ as a straight ally."" Recipients are encouraged to display the brochure or a DOJ Pride sticker in clear view or request that their office receive follow-up training on gender identity in the workplace. Also: ""Do consider coming out of the closet if you are LGBT and not out at work. The presence of visible LGBT managers communicates that your office is open and accepting."" In another section, the brochure says that if an employee ""comes out to you,"" don’t ""judge or remain silent. Silence will be interpreted as disapproval. Do respond with interest and curiosity. Asking respectful questions will set a positive, supportive tone."" By telephone, Matt Barber, a Liberty Counsel attorney, told us the brochure was sent to agency employees on May 14, 2013. At our request, Barber emailed us what he described as a copy of that email with the name of the whistleblower worker who brought it to the firm’s attention redacted. One agency's distribution The ""To"" line of the email says, ""Global Distribution."" The email message, under the subject ""LGBT Pride Month,"" describes the attached brochure as complementing a planned LGBT Pride Month observance. The email expresses hope that the brochure, ""drafted with input from key department stakeholders,"" will be a useful tool ""as you work to create an office environment that is welcoming to, and supportive of, all employees, including LGBT employees."" The email closes with: ""This message has been authorized by Nelson A. Santos, Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Forensic Sciences."" By phone, Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona told us Santos works for the Drug Enforcement Administration. Talamona initially told us that the publication was distributed to ""some employees"" by email with the department’s awareness. However, she said, it is not an agency policy or directive. Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson later emailed a statement that seemed to indicate the DEA official sent the brochure to many of that agency's workers. All told, its employees account for some 9,000 of the Justice Department’s 115,000 workers, Iverson said. Iverson's statement said ""DOJ Pride, an employee association, sent informational material, on its own behalf, to some DOJ employees. The material was clearly identified as a DOJ Pride product. We have also recently learned one component’s diversity official distributed the information via email to its employees on behalf of DOJ Pride. The single-page document was produced on a DOJ computer and involved limited use of a DOJ printer to make a few dozen copies, in line with the department’s de minimis use policy allowing employees to make minimal personal use of their DOJ computers when the cost to the government is negligible."" Barber said that while the brochure was authored by an employee group, not the department proper, ""it came under the auspices of the larger Department of Justice."" He added that the agency ""knows it would be unconstitutional to expressly compel department employees to openly embrace homosexuality and gay marriage."" The brochure, he said, delivers a compliance threat that is implied rather than explicit. Diversity policy More broadly, the department says online it has a diversity management policy: ""We work diligently to attract and retain a workforce that represents the range of personal and professional backgrounds, and experiences and perspectives that arise from differences of culture and circumstances. This includes persons of varying age, ethnicity, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, political affiliation, socioeconomic and family status, and geographic region."" As noted in a May 24, 2013, blog post by WND, a conservative Internet news organization, Holder aired support for diversity in a June 6, 2012, speech marking the agency’s LGBT Pride Month celebration. After mentioning efforts to combat school bullying and to help students who feel unsafe or victimized, Holder said: ""It is this same determination that guides the Justice Department’s internal efforts to create a more inclusive work environment, and to strengthen our mission to serve all Americans by attracting a diverse range of qualified individuals; and by providing the opportunities--and the support necessary--for every department employee to develop, to grow, and to thrive both personally and professionally."" Our ruling Gohmert said a Justice Department memo ""directs that you must openly embrace gay marriage and homosexuality."" The department promotes diversity. But there doesn't appear to be a department memo or mandate that employees openly support gay marriage or homosexuality. That said, a subset of workers received a brochure from an agency-sanctioned employee group encouraging managers to respect and support gay workers.

548,12749,On whether or not the Philadelphia DA's office will recommend the possibility of parole for all juvenile lifers.,"March 16, 2017","District Attorney Seth Williams told The Philadelphia Inquirer last year that it was his goal ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel"" when it comes to re-sentencing juvenile lifers still in the Pennsylvania prison system. His office says he made clear there could be exceptions in the most heinous cases. That’s why Williams’ team contends his stance didn’t shift when it didn’t offer the chance of parole to three individuals so far as it continues the process of reviewing 300 cases of juvenile lifers in Pennsylvania. But we keep going back to when he tweeted that ""we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically"" and that ""they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole."" He then doubled down on that stance when asked directly about it on Twitter. The district attorney also indicated he agreed with the Miller decision, and wouldn’t seek life without parole for juveniles convicted of homicide moving forward. That’s since changed for at least three people who could remain in prison for life without the possibility of parole.",Anna Orso,"Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams took to the opinion pages of The Philadelphia Inquirer last week to defend himself from criticism that he reversed his stance on the individuals who have been deemed ""juvenile lifers"" in the criminal justice system. Williams, a Democrat who is finishing out his second term as district attorney and will not seek re-election, apparently took issue with an early March Inquirer piece that indicated the DA had changed his previous stance on offering the chance of parole to those convicted of homicide when they were juveniles. In the piece, the Inquirer reported Williams and his staff intend to seek sentences of life without parole for at least three of the 300 Philadelphia juvenile lifers whose sentences are under review. The district attorney wrote in that letter to the editor published last week that ""the article is contradicted by the paper's prior reporting"" and that his ""approach to these cases is fair, reasonable, and consistent with the judgments of the Pennsylvania legislature and the U.S. Supreme Court."" So did Williams reverse his stance or not? We decided to put it to the test on our Flip-O-Meter, which specifically tracks whether politicians have gone back on their promises. Let’s look first at what Williams’ stance on juvenile lifers was, and why it’s been of interest over the last several years. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miller v. Alabama that it’s a violation of the Eighth Amendment for states to require a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for individuals convicted of committing homicide before they turned 18. The court ruled those sentences should be ""uncommon"" and reserved for ""the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption."" By the end of 2012, the Pennsylvania legislature passed new sentencing requirements for juveniles convicted of first- or second-degree murder, ranging from a 20-years-to-life sentence to a 35-years-to-life sentence, depending on degree and how old the person was when the crime was committed. That new legislation applied only to new sentences handed down after the Miller decision. But things got complicated last year when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Miller v. Alabama decision to prohibit mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole for juveniles would apply retroactively. That set off a chaotic process in the criminal justice system that’s being resolved by district attorneys, judges and criminal defense attorneys across the state resentencing individuals according to new requirements, but largely leaving it up to judge’s discretion to make a final determination on each individual. There were about 480 juvenile lifers across the state system; 300 of those are from Philadelphia. Last summer, Williams said in an Inquirer interview that it was his goal ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel."" ""As long as I'm the D.A.,"" he said, ""we will not be asking for cases going forward for life without the possibility of parole for people under the age of 18 because of the same exact reasons articulated by the Supreme Court in Miller."" The promise earned Williams praise from progressive groups, and he was even lauded in a New York Times editorial that ended with: ""Now that Mr. Williams has put that principle into practice, district attorneys in other counties with large numbers of juvenile lifers have a clearer path to follow."" In the same Inquirer interview from last year, Williams said ""I've got a lot of people who are tweeting every day about juvenile lifers without parole."" Some of them he even responded to. On June 3, 2016, the district attorney tweeted to someone asking questions about his policy: ""we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole."" He even doubled down when the person responded, asking: ""does that mean the Philly DAs office will not seek LWOP (life without parole) in any of those 300 cases?"" Williams tweeted back: ""just keep reading my last tweet."" So at the beginning of this month, the Inquirer wrote that it appeared Williams’ stance had shifted. Journalist Samantha Melamed reported Williams’ office, in a letter to a federal court, indicated it intends to seek life without parole in at least three of the cases it had reviewed so far. Officials from Williams’ office confirmed that this week, saying it’s so far made 96 offers, three of which were for life without parole. They refused to provide any information about those three cases, saying the offers are still under consideration by defense attorneys and the final determination will be made by a judge. The Inquirer reported one of the individuals who the DA’s office is recommending life without parole for is Andre Martin, who was 15 when he shot and killed police officer John Trettin in 1976. From the story: ""According to Inquirer coverage from 1976, Martin had an IQ of 80 and was high on Valium and marijuana when he shot a police officer through the window of an apartment in a public-housing project."" Following that March Inquirer story about Williams’ apparent shifting stance, Williams wrote in a letter to the editor that there was no change in his stance and quoted the Inquirer’s original June 2016 piece that read: ""[Williams] said he won't rule out life without parole in the most heinous cases, but he has taken heed of the Supreme Court's opinion, in Miller, that neuroscience shows teens' brains are not fully formed, reducing their culpability."" Melamed said the Inquirer stands by its reporting, which is ""why the district attorney’s claim appeared in the form of a letter to the editor rather than a correction."" Williams’ chief of staff Kathleen Martin said in an interview this week that ""he hopes or expects not to have a lot of murderers who were juveniles remain, but in certain circumstances, including heinous crimes, that might in fact happen."" She described the office’s process for reviewing each of the juvenile lifer cases, saying it’s assigned a team of assistant district attorneys and other stakeholders to review every case, starting with the oldest ones. They’re seeking out surviving family members of victims, combing through old case files and reviewing information from the Department of Corrections about how the inmates have operated in prison. After that process, the team determined that they’ll request life in prison without the chance of parole for at least three juvenile lifers from Philadelphia. When PolitiFact asked Martin, Williams’ chief of staff, about whether or not this move conflicts with Williams’ past statements saying ""all"" 300 individuals would have a chance at parole, she said the three inmates in question still do have that chance because ""the judge is always going to have a final determination."" But that would go against what the DA’s office is requesting. Martin also said Williams’ original quote to the Inquirer that he wanted ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel"" was referring to his goals ""moving forward"" in sentencing new juveniles. ""It’s clear that the DA had a goal, but in the most heinous occasions, that goal cannot always be met,"" Martin said. ""There are just unfortunately some cases in which the best interest of the community at large is that certain people remain in custody."" Our ruling District Attorney Seth Williams told The Philadelphia Inquirer last year that it was his goal ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel"" when it comes to re-sentencing juvenile lifers still in the Pennsylvania prison system. His office says he made clear there could be exceptions in the most heinous cases. That’s why Williams’ team contends his stance didn’t shift when it didn’t offer the chance of parole to three individuals so far as it continues the process of reviewing 300 cases of juvenile lifers in Pennsylvania. But we keep going back to when he tweeted that ""we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically"" and that ""they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole."" He then doubled down on that stance when asked directly about it on Twitter.

553,8101,India bans export of drug being tested for coronavirus treatment.,"March 25, 2020",India said on Wednesday it had banned the export of hydroxychloroquine and formulations of the malaria drug while experts test its efficacy in helping treat patients infected with coronavirus.,Neha Dasgupta,"There are currently no approved treatments, or preventive vaccines for COVID-19, the highly contagious, sometimes deadly respiratory illness caused by coronavirus. Researchers are studying existing treatments and working on experimental ones, but most current patients receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance. Hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, is among the medications undergoing testing as a potential treatment for patients with the disease. Earlier this week, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), which maintains a list of drug shortages, said there was a shortage of hydroxychloroquine. “Chloroquine has demonstrated toxicity in certain patients,” Dinesh Dua, chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India, told Reuters. “You have to tread with caution because there is no comprehensive data to prove it works.”    The group said India, the world’s largest supplier of generic drugs, was not short of the drug but that companies were acutely short of staff to run operations. Cadila Healthcare Ltd, part of the Zydus group and one of India’s top makers of the drug, said it was ramping up production to about 200 million pills a month. “The priority is to work with the government in these challenging times and do all that we can in combating the coronavirus,” a spokesman said. Earlier on Wednesday, Cadila Healthcare’s stock fell more than 5% after the export ban was announced. Late on Tuesday, India ordered a 21-day lockdown of its 1.3 billion people to try to protect the world’s second most populous country from the fast-spreading coronavirus. “It is impossible to maintain operations due to lockdown, because employees don’t want to come (to work),” Dua said. India has already banned the export of ventilators, sanitizers and personal protection equipment such as masks and clothing used in the fight against the virus, which has so far infected more than 500 people and killed nine in the country. The ban came after India this month curbed the export of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and the medicines made from them, including Paracetamol - a common pain reliever also sold as acetaminophen - as the coronavirus outbreak plays havoc with supply chains.

554,33870,"Walt Disney was an illegitimate child, born out of wedlock to a woman from a town near Almeria in southern Spain and adopted by Flora and Elias Disney.","July 29, 1996","That Walt Disney was born in 1901, not 1890, is beyond dispute. Even though a birth certificate might not exist, photographs and school records clearly demonstrate that Walt was not more than ten years older than commonly believed. He could not possibly be the result of a liaison between Señora Zamora and Elias Disney that occurred in 1890. Even if Eliot were wrong about the date and the two hooked up in 1900 or 1901 (although, once again, this contradicts Eliot’s earlier explanations of how and why Zamora came to be in America in the first place), a baby resulting from that union could simply not have been passed off as Flora and Elias’s own child, unless we are to believe that nobody — not friends, not relatives, not fellow church members, not even the Disneys’ own children — ever noticed that Flora “gave birth” to a child without having been pregnant in the first place.",David Mikkelson,"No real evidence exists to defend the claim that Walt Disney’s natural parents were anyone other than Flora and Elias Disney (shown above). Support for Walt Disney’s having Spanish parentage is based solely on fragmentary and contradictory bits of hearsay and rumor, without the backing of a single piece of substantive documentation. One version of the legend, as recounted by Mosley, identifies a young woman named Consuela Suarez from the Spanish town of Mojacar (or Mojacca) as Disney’s “real” mother. Señorita Suarez, the story goes, was engaged to a young man from her village who was killed in Morocco before the marriage could take place, leaving her unwed and pregnant. After giving birth, Consuela allegedly enlisted the aid of a local priest to arrange for an American couple to take the child back to the USA, where she (having arrived later) “signed the papers which enabled her son to be formally adopted and made a US citizen.” Only shortly before her death, when she finally returned to her native Spain, did Conseula learn that the son she had given up many years before was now the world-famous Walt Disney. The tale is charming as a modern-day fairy tale, but it hardly stands up to critical examination. Why did Conseula Suarez give up her child for adoption? Presumably it was to avoid the scandal of being an unwed mother in a primarily Catholic country, yet both Señorita Suarez and her son immediately relocated to America, where no one would have known about the circumstances of the child’s birth, thus allowing her to keep her son without fear of censure. And who was this mystery couple who brought Consuela’s son to America? Certainly not Flora and Elias Disney, who never visited Spain and had no ties of any kind to that country. How and why did this couple come in contact with the Disneys? The question also remains (regardless of how the child came to the USA) as to why the Disneys, who could barely make ends meet and already had three sons of their own, would adopt a stranger’s child. (The notion that Flora and Elias might have adopted a child because of their own inability to produce further offspring is belied by the fact that Flora gave birth to a daughter a few years later.) Lastly, where are the adoption and naturalization records for this mystery child? Local adoption papers might disappear (or be made to disappear), but not so federal citizenship records. Marc Eliot revived this legend in a more expansive (and a much more contrived and convoluted) form in Walt Disney: Hollywood’s Dark Prince. In Eliot’s version, Walt Disney’s “real” mother was a washerwoman named Isabelle Zamora (Ascensio) from Mojacar, who became pregnant by a man from the same village, the already married Dr. José Guirao. Dr. Guirao, who passed away shortly after the child’s birth, named his son after himself; Señora Zamora left Spain with the child and headed for the east coast of the United States soon afterwards, claims Eliot, “because she and Dr. Guirao were devout Catholics and wished to protect both their families.” (Why a couple desirous of protecting their families from the scandal of an out of wedlock birth would draw attention to their adulterous affair by naming their child after its father remains unexplained.) Isabelle eventually made her way to the west coast, where she was “taken in by Franciscan missionaries.” Even if we proceed from the assumption that Señora Zamora and her child actually existed, the legend breaks down when any attempt is made to link them to Flora and Elias Disney. Eliot claims that Elias Disney met up with Señora Zamora in 1890, after he “took leave of his wife and children . . . to take part in the second wave of the California Gold Rush,” not returning home until early in 1891. Elias’ departure for California is apparently a fact known only to Eliot, for no other source of biographical information about the Disney family mentions it. (Indeed, there is no evidence that Elias Disney ventured anywhere close the west coast after moving his family to Chicago in 1889, and Eliot offers no source for his assertion that Elias made such a trip. Mosley does write that Elias once set out for the California goldfields with his father and brother, but that was in 1878, and Elias reportedly made it no further west than Kansas.) How Elias managed to father a different child (Raymond Arnold Disney, born late in 1890) with his wife Flora — despite spending the year away from her — is another inconsistency for which Eliot offers no explanation. Let’s say Señora Zamora and her child were real, and Elias Disney somehow managed to end up in California and meet up with them in 1890. Why would Elias Disney, already married and the father of three sons, offer to adopt this Spanish washerwoman’s child? The answer is simple, says Eliot: Elias Disney had an affair with Señora Zamora in California, brought her back with him to Chicago as a “kept woman,” then forced Flora to raise the child as their own to avoid the shame and humiliation that would befall them if his scandalous affair were revealed. (Hedging his bets at this point, Eliot suggest that perhaps Señora Zamora’s child wasn’t born until after her arrival in America, maybe even as the result of an affair with Elias Disney. These hypotheses, of course, completely contradict Eliot’s earlier explanations of why and how Señora Zamora came to be in America in the first place.) But one simple fact demolishes this theory: Walt Disney was born in 1901, not 1890. Eliot is left with a gap of over ten years between Elias’ alleged affair with Señora Zamora and Walt’s birth. Eliot disingenuously tries to skirt around the eleven-year discrepancy by pointing out that there is no official record of Walt Disney’s birth in Cook Country, Illinois, on the birthdate that has always been claimed for him (December 5, 1901), yet there is a record of a “Walter Disney” having been born to Flora and Elias Disney more than ten years earlier, on January 8, 1891. This, Eliot deceptively argues, demonstrates that Walt Disney’s official date of birth has been manipulated in an attempt to cover up his true origins. The official record of birth from Cook County on which Eliot bases his claim does not report the birth of someone named “Walter Disney” on January 8, 1891, however; it merely shows that the birth of someone by that name was recorded on that date. The actual date of birth for the person named is clearly printed on the same document: December 30, 1890. Not coincidentally, this is the exact birth date of one of Walt’s older brothers, Raymond Arnold Disney. The birth record refers to Raymond’s birth, not Walt’s. For whatever reason, Disney’s parents, after initially deciding to name their second son Walter Elias, changed their minds and christened him Raymond Arnold instead. The discrepancy in birth records is not difficult to explain. Birth certificates were not required by law in Illinois at the turn of the century, and official paperwork for a child born at home without a doctor in attendance (as Walt was) often went unfiled. The lack of a birth certificate for Walt Disney is therefore not unusual. (Despite Mosley’s statement that Disney “was indubitably a native-born American as his birth certificate, a copy of which can still be obtained in Chicago, will testify,” no birth certificate for Walt Disney is known to exist.) The confusion of names on the record of Raymond’s birth cannot be definitively explained, but most likely either Flora and Elias Disney had not firmly agreed on a name for their son at the time the birth was recorded, or else they later changed their minds. (Mosley reports a similar disagreement between Flora and Elias Disney over the choice of name for their third son, Roy Oliver Disney.) Quite possibly the Disneys had intended to honor a promise they made to their preacher, Walter Parr, to name their next son after him, but then decided against it. Several years later — perhaps as a belated fulfillment of that promise — they named their fourth son Walter.",false,"Disney, disney rumors, Walt Disney"
556,22298,"We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more,"" to house children in state custody","April 8, 2011",Rep. DaSilva says R.I. pays hundreds of thousands of dollars for out-of-state care for children in state custody,Peter Lord,"State Rep. Roberto DaSilva recently introduced legislation intended to make it much more difficult for the state Department of Children, Youth and Families to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities. He said he was moved by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who was the subject of a column by The Providence Journal’s Bob Kerr. Alahverdian says he endured years of abuse and neglect in two out-of-state residential facilities where he was sent by DCYF. He has formed his own nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care. He has also filed state and federal lawsuits stemming from his alleged mistreatment. DaSilva said in a General Assembly news release that Rhode Island has the resources to provide children with the treatment they need within the state. DaSilva said he is concerned about the well-being of children in state care and also about keeping taxpayer dollars in the state. ""We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more, to house our own state residents,"" DaSilva said. ""It just doesn’t make sense, especially in these dire economic times."" Among the children the DCYF takes into its custody are those who are victims of abuse or neglect caused by their primary caretakers, those who are in the juvenile justice system and ordered by courts to have access to rehabilitative care, and those with emotional, behavioral or developmental challenges who need out-of-home care and treatment and whose parents give DCYF temporary custody, according to DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin. The DCYF has said it is working to reduce its dependence on residential treatment programs, both in Rhode Island and in other states. So we wondered whether the agency is still spending as much as DaSilva says on such placements. We asked DaSilva where he got his information and he referred us to a website called the Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal. It shows the agency’s expenditures in various categories such as personnel and foster care. The top expenditure is residential services. For fiscal year 2010, for instance, the portal shows the state spent $117 million for residential care for youth in DCYF custody, which also includes costs for foster home placements and varous community services   Much of that money was spent on local services such as Child and Family Services of Newport County or Ocean Tides, a residential treatment program in Narragansett for male juvenile offenders. The DCYF also budgets an additional $22.4 million this year for youths sent to the Rhode Island Training School. But the website shows that millions of dollars go to out-of-state programs. For example, Mass Mentor Inc., which provides services at several Massachusetts locations to children with developmental disabilities was paid $376,829 in the first quarter. During the same quarter, the Bennington School in Vermont was paid $77,769 and the Glen Mills School in Pennsylvania got $59,246. We asked Kevin J. Aucoin, interim director of DCYF, for more data. He said that this fiscal year, the DCYF expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities, most of them in nearby states. Aucoin says the spending on residential programs has been declining. In fiscal year 2007, for example, the state spent $85.4 million for 1,102 children. In that year, it spent $18.4 million to send 154 children out of state. All residential placements are expected to be reduced as the agency adopts a new model of care that focuses on keeping families together. Aucoin said the DCYF sends children out of state for specialized treatments not offered by in-state providers. Those include multiple psychiatric diagnoses and severe and profound developmental disabilities. The majority, he said, have severe aggressive behaviors. Some may be youth with significant ""sexual offending behaviors."" Aucoin said children are placed out of state only with approval of the Family Court and only after the agency demonstrates there is no adequate program in-state. So it appears the only fault with DaSilva’s claim is it is too conservative. Instead of spending the ""hundreds of thousands,"" DaSilva claims, the state actually expects to spend nearly $10 million on out-of-state programs. We find his claim to be .",true,"Rhode Island, Children, Families, State Budget, Roberto DaSilva, "

Everett didn’t explicitly say as much and told us she doesn’t believe it. However, on two occasions, she raised the ""what-if"" spectre of a woman somehow passing along the virus or an STD through fetal material flushed down a drain.",W. Gardner Selby,"After word surfaced that a conservative nonprofit won a $1.6 million state grant to deliver women’s health services, U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro questioned the decision while making a ""sewer"" claim about the group’s director. Castro, D-San Antonio, said in an August 2016 tweet: ""The group's director believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system. Is it really most qualified for the grant?"" Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which causes AIDS, is mainly spread through sexual contact or from sharing needles, syringes, rinse water or other equipment with someone who has the virus, according to a federal website focused on AIDS. Less commonly, per the site, the virus may be spread from mother to child during pregnancy, by being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle and, in rare cases, via blood transfusions and eating food pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person. We spotted no mention of the virus getting conveyed from anything in a sewer pipe. ""HIV does not survive long outside the human body (such as on surfaces) and it cannot reproduce outside a human host,"" the site says. The virus also isn’t spread by air or water, the site says. Seeking Castro’s factual backup, we heard from his House spokeswoman, Erin Hatch, who emailed us web links to summer 2016 news stories--including an Austin American-Statesman story posted earlier the day of Castro’s tweet about Carol Everett, chief executive of the Round Rock-based Heidi Group, which once ran no-charge crisis pregnancy centers in Dallas advising women with unplanned pregnancies about giving birth. Everett, the story said, ""recently came under scrutiny for suggesting during a fetal tissue disposal hearing that sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, could be transmitted through the sewer system."" Everett told the paper, though, that her highlighted comments had been misunderstood. Everett also told reporter Julie Chang that her remarks about HIV amounted to ""a stupid mistake."" Chang shared with us her notes from her interview with Everett, who said: ""I very much regret what I said. I shouldn’t have even tried… because they misunderstood it. I didn’t talk about transmitting STDs that way. I was trying to talk about the fact that babies are ground up and put into these garbage disposals which goes into our sewers. I didn’t make that point very clearly."" Existing regulations allow fetal remains, as with other medical tissue, to be ground and discharged into a sewer system, incinerated or disinfected followed by disposal in a landfill, or ""an approved alternate treatment process, provided that the process renders the item as unrecognizable, followed by deposition in a sanitary landfill."" Two instances For our part, we confirmed from a TV news report noted by Hatch and Chang’s recording of Everett’s comments before a state agency that she indeed made mention of HIV and sewers while advocating for state officials to adopt a rule requiring fetal remains to be buried or cremated rather than disposed other ways. The rule was proposed in June 2016 by the executive commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission on behalf of the Department of State Health Services; it wasn’t finalized as of Aug. 17, 2016. Chang’s recording of Everett’s comments at an Aug. 4, 2016 state hearing on the proposed rule show Everett expressed criticism of current disposal methods, further saying: ""What does this really do to the public? There are other people to consider. ""What if one of those sewer treatment programs breaks down one day? You know, the abortion industry doesn’t have time; they only see a woman one time; they do not do an AIDS test, they don’t do, they don’t know if she’s HIV-positive. They don’t know if she has a sexually transmitted disease. And what if one day, just one day, something horrible escaped into the sewer system?"" (Laughter.) ""It may sound funny but it’s something we could think about because I can tell you today, the public is thinking about it. ""So I appreciate very much addressing this. I encourage you to uphold it. Let’s take care of those who cannot take care of themselves -- and I am talking about the women."" Earlier, as pointed out by Hatch, Everett said in an interview with Austin’s Fox 7 aired July 7, 2016, that existing protocols for disposing fetal remains pose ""several health concerns. What if the woman had HIV? What if she had a sexually transmitted disease? What if those germs went through and got into our water supply?"" Everett said. When we reached Everett about Castro's claim, she said by phone she hadn’t explicitly said HIV is spread through sewer pipes--and doesn’t believe as much. ""People with HIV and AIDS go to the bathroom every day,"" Everett said. At the state hearing, she said, she was trying to stress that fetal material gets into the sewer system. Everett called her comment to Austin’s Fox 7 about HIV/STD ""germs"" getting into ""our"" water supply ""really far out. I shouldn’t have said that."" Our ruling Castro said Everett ""believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system."" Everett didn’t explicitly say as much and told us she doesn’t believe it.

560,8065,Italy suffers setback to hopes its coronavirus epidemic might be in retreat.,"March 26, 2020","Hopes that Italy’s coronavirus epidemic might be in retreat suffered a setback on Thursday when data showed that both the number of new cases and deaths had ticked higher, underscoring how hard it is to halt the disease.","Crispian Balmer, Gavin Jones","Officials said 712 people died of the illness in the last 24 hours, pushing the total tally to 8,215, well over double that seen in anywhere else in the world, while new infections rose by 6,153 to 80,539. The number of cases is nudging close to the more than 81,000 infections recorded in China where the pandemic began. The relentless rise in Italy is despite stringent lockdown measures introduced progressively since Feb. 23 to try to stop the spread, which authorities had hoped would be having more of an effect by now. There had been slight declines in both new cases and deaths earlier this week, but the northern region of Lombardy, the epicentre of the outbreak, saw its numbers climb on Thursday. “I do not know if we have hit the peak or if we have missed something ... all I can say is that I am worried,” Lombardy governor Attilio Fontana told reporters, adding that the situation would soon become clearer. “I think that in two or three days we will understand if the measures we have taken are working,” he said. However, he warned that when new cases finally receded, the government would not necessarily be able to relax the lockdown, which is due to be lifted on April 3. “Even if the number of cases declines, I think we will have to carry on with (the restrictions) until we are quite certain that this contagion has been stopped.”  The situation appeared particularly worrying in Lombardy’s capital Milan, which is also Italy’s financial hub, where new infections jumped by more than 800 to almost 7,000. Only the neighbouring provinces of Bergamo and Brescia have a higher number of cases. Highlighting the scale of the drama, Bergamo said that over the last 10 years it had recorded on average 45 deaths a week. This ticked up to 64 at the end of February and then soared, hitting a peak of 313 deaths between March 15-21. The disease has also taken a heavy toll amongst medical workers, with the national federation of doctors and surgeons saying on Thursday that 40 doctors had so far died, many of them general practitioners in northern towns and cities. Italy’s less developed south is growing increasingly anxious as it sees its own numbers push up, with several regions reporting growth rates in new cases that are above the national average. In an open letter to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, the head of the Campania region, which is centred on Naples, warned of impending disaster. “At this point there is the real prospect that Lombardy’s tragedy is about to become the south’s tragedy,” Vincenzo De Luca wrote. “We are on the cusp of a major expansion of infections that we might not be able to manage.”",true,Health News

""The fact that Rick Scott is running for governor as a 'reformer' would be funny if it wasn't so outrageous,"" Williams said. ""This is a man who barely escaped imprisonment, whose failure in business has been portrayed on national news and around the world. He is an embarrassment.

We'll start with Sink's claim that Scott ""was forced to resign as the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud, including 14 felonies, leading to a historic $1.7 billion fine. ""On his campaign website, Scott admits HCA has paid $1.7 billion in fines as part of a federal settlement concerning fraudulent health care billing, so there's not much point in checking that.But we hadn't heard the claim that HCA pleaded guilty to 14 felonies.Scott started what was first Columbia in the spring of 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. In 1994, Scott's Columbia purchased HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies to form Columbia/HCA. When Scott resigned as CEO in 1997, Columbia/HCA had grown to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries, Scott's campaign says. The company employed more than 285,000 people.Now, about why Scott left Columbia/HCA in 1997.That year, federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, first seizing records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanding across the country. The scope of the investigation at first was unclear; even Scott said he didn't know what the U.S. Justice Department was looking for.But it later became apparent that the investigation focused on whether Columbia bilked Medicare and Medicaid.Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, less than four months after the inquiry became public and before the level of fraud became known. Company executives said had Scott remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy.Was he forced out as Sink claims? It's hard to tell. We don't know what happened in Columbia's board of directors meeting back in July 1997. So we have to go on news accounts from that time.USA Today put it this way: ""Under pressure from his board of directors, Columbia CEO Richard Scott quit Friday. ""The St. Petersburg Times: ""The top two executives at Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. resigned Friday under pressure from an increasingly hostile board."" Other articles used the words ""amid pressure,"" or ""ousted"" to describe Scott's departure. Scott campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said Scott left Columbia/HCA over a disagreement on how to handle the fraud investigation. ""There was a disagreement on how to move forward in light of the investigation and he and the company parted ways,"" Baker said. ""The board wanted to settle the fines and Rick took the position that the courts ultimately did, which was that there could be honest disagreement over how the regulations were interpreted."" In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced what it called the largest government fraud settlement in U.S. history when Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties.Among the revelations from the 2000 settlement: The government settled a second series of claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The claims were largely related to additional allegations of fraud. The combination of the two settlements is how Sink, Scott and others reach the $1.7 billion figure.But none of that speaks directly to the fact cited in the Sink statement, that HCA pleaded guilty to 14 felonies in connection with the fraud case.The Sink campaign referred us to a December 2002 New York Times article. Indeed, the article said that in 2000 the hospital chain agreed to plead guilty to 14 separate felonies. But that's an article talking about a 2000 event. There were no stories from 2000 that referenced Columbia/HCA and 14 felonies.So we went to the Department of Justice looking for help.There we unearthed the original press release. Dated Dec. 14, 2000, the release highlights the record $840 million settlement agreed to between HCA and the Department of Justice. ""Health care fraud impacts every American citizen. When a company defrauds our nation's health care programs, it takes money out of the pockets of the American taxpayers. It is wrong,"" then-Attorney General Janet Reno said in the release. ""This investigation has been the largest multi-agency investigation of a health care provider ever undertaken by the U.S. and reflects our commitment to vigorously pursuing all types of health care fraud schemes.

The criminal fine is $3.36 million;Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta) -- Columbia Homecare Inc. will plead guilty to one count of violating the Medicare Anti-kickback Statute related to purchase of home health agencies. The criminal fine is $3.36 million;Department of Justice Criminal Fraud Section -- Another subsidiary, Columbia Management Companies Inc., will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and to make and use false writings and documents in connection with its fraudulent ""upcoding"" of bills to Medicare for patients diagnosed with certain types of pneumonia. The criminal fine is $27.5 million. This investigation was based in Nashville, Tennessee;Middle District of Florida (Tampa) -- Columbia Homecare Group will plead guilty to one count of conspiring to defraud the U.S. and one count of conspiracy to violate the Medicare Anti-kickback Statute in connection with the purchase and operation of home health agencies. The criminal fine is $8.4 million. Also, Columbia Management Companies will plead guilty to eight counts of making false statements to the U.S. in connection with the submission of false cost reports to Medicare. The fine amount is $22.6 million; and,Western District of Texas (El Paso) -- Columbia Homecare Group will plead to a conspiracy to pay kickbacks and other monetary benefits to doctors in violation of the Medicare Anti-kickback Statute. The criminal fine is $30.1 million.A couple of important notes. The actual plea deals were arranged with HCA subsidiaries and not the hospital chain itself. That was done so HCA could continue to participate in the Medicare program. Also, all of the charges deal with corporate criminal liability. Scott wasn't charged individually, and the plea deal was struck after Scott already had left the company.Secondly, we noticed how the discussion regarding the El Paso charge was different than in the other four jurisdictions. But based on the size of the fine, $30.1 million, we feel safe assuming there was at least one count agreed to as part of the settlement.Adding that in with the others indeed adds up to 14. In interviews, Scott accepts responsibility for the problems at Columbia/HCA, but denies direct knowledge of the fraud. ""There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes. I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient,'' Scott told the St. Petersburg Times this month. ""I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader."" In its claim, the Sink campaign says Scott ""was forced to resign as the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud, including 14 felonies, leading to a historic $1.7 billion fine."" Scott's former company, Columbia/HCA, did plead guilty to 14 felony charges stemming from a massive federal fraud investigation, and Scott himself admits the company wound up paying $1.7 billion in fines. Whether Scott was forced to resign or not is something of an HR employment trick, but  media accounts certainly suggest the company's board of directors was under pressure from shareholders to shake things up.

562,28052,Insulin can be purchased at Walmart for $25 a vial.,"February 7, 2019","What's true: Novo Nordisk-manufactured human insulin can be purchased at Walmart stores without a prescription for $24.88 a vial (except in Indiana). What's false: The most commonly prescribed form of insulin is insulin analogs, which require a prescription and are currently the subject of a controversy over soaring prices.",Bethania Palma,"In early February 2019, amid continued public outcry over the soaring cost of life-saving pharmaceuticals, readers shared a screen-captured image on social media of a local news station’s reporting on the story of a woman who said she bought inexpensive insulin without a prescription at Walmart:  Readers asked us whether this was true. It is true, although you should note Walmart sells human insulin, an older version of the glucose-moderating hormone, whereas most insulin-dependent diabetics are currently prescribed insulin analogs that have evolved to help prevent dangerous swings in blood-glucose levels. The screenshot above was taken from a 4 February 2019 news broadcast from Dallas–Fort Worth television station KDFW:  We confirmed with Walmart that the retail chain does indeed sell human insulin without a prescription (except in Indiana). That product is Novo Nordisk-manufactured Novolin, which Walmart has branded as ReliOn and sells for $24.88 per vial. Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis confirmed to us that the company has “maintained, through negotiation, the same retail to patients since 2011.” To say that the insulin is sold “over-the-counter” isn’t quite accurate, however, as customers must ask a pharmacist for it. Although this revelation might be important, life-saving information for diabetics, an important caveat is that human insulin behaves differently than the newer analog insulin currently retailing for more than $300 a vial. Dr. Todd Hobbs, chief medical officer for Novo Nordisk, wrote that the different types of insulin have the same effect of lowering blood-glucose levels, but, “Training is required whenever someone is prescribed insulin, whether that be human insulin or the newer analog insulin products. Differences in the timing of all types of insulin must be considered for patients to effectively use them … The difference in the types of insulin is related to how slowly or rapidly they are absorbed once injected. Scientific advances over the years have made improvements on the speed and length of time this absorption occurs.” Diabetes Forecast, a health-oriented magazine associated with the American Diabetics Association, explained the history of the two types of insulin and the difference in health benefits this way: In the 1970s, researchers discovered how to program bacteria in the lab to manufacture human insulin, and in 1982, regular human insulin became the first “recombinant DNA” drug product. “It’s a very pure, clean product, and it’s exactly what we as humans make,” [Virginia Commonwealth University School of Pharmacy associate professor and a spokesman for the American Association of Diabetes Educators Evan] Sisson says. Human insulin is now available as short-acting “regular” (or “R”) insulin, which is used at mealtimes, and intermediate-acting NPH (or “N”) insulin, which is used as a basal insulin … While the development of human insulin was a major advancement, it wasn’t perfect. Regular insulin didn’t hit the bloodstream quick enough to cover the rapid absorption of carbohydrates after meals, and it stuck around too long after meals, causing hypoglycemia [low blood glucose, which can lead to unconsciousness and death if untreated]. In 1996, Eli Lilly introduced the first rapid-acting insulin analog to the market: insulin lispro (Humalog). Insulin aspart (Novo Nordisk’s Novolog) and insulin glulisine (Sanofi’s Apidra) quickly followed. With rapid-acting insulin analogs, onset occurs 10 to 20 minutes after injection, instead of the 30 to 60 minutes it takes for regular human insulin to take effect. This allows people to inject their insulin right before a meal, rather than having to dose 30 minutes or more before eating … Deliver a dose of NPH [human] insulin, and it’ll reach its peak about six to eight hours later. This means your insulin may peak while you’re sleeping, posing a serious danger if you don’t wake up to treat. Long-acting analogs, on the other hand, don’t peak, resulting in more-stable blood glucose levels and fewer unexpected highs or lows. In fact, one study showed that long-acting analog insulin glargine reduced overnight bouts of hypoglycemia by up to 48 percent compared with NPH. In another study, detemir reduced nighttime hypoglycemia by 34 percent. This is especially beneficial for people with type 1, who need to be much more precise about matching insulin dosages with their insulin needs to avoid nighttime lows, says Sisson. Note, there are two types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetics’ bodies cannot manufacture insulin, the hormone responsible for glucose absorption. Type 2 diabetics’ bodies, on the other hand, become resistant to insulin. In most cases, Type 1 diabetes starts in childhood, whereas Type 2 is sometimes referred to as “adult-onset” diabetes. Writing for Insulin Nation, Nicki Nichols explained why the older form of human insulin is difficult to control in children: When my child was first diagnosed, she was on NPH. It was incredibly difficult to limit a growing child’s diet to such a strict schedule. Here’s what it looked like: 8 a.m.- 45-carb meal 10:30 a.m. – 15-carb snack 12 p.m. – 45-carb meal 2 p.m. – 15-carb snack 5 p.m. – 45-carb meal 7:30 p.m. – 15-20 carb snack before bed to keep blood sugar up overnight. I cannot tell you how many times my child refused to eat the 45 carbs in her dinner. There is something wrong when you are fussing at your 5-year-old to stop eating her green beans and to eat her bread, or mashed potatoes, or pasta. The screen shot from the KDFW report no doubt went viral as a result of an ongoing controversy over the cost of analog insulin, which as of 7 February 2019 soared to a retail price of more than $300 per vial. Americans have been awash in medical horror stories such the death of Jesse Lutgen, a 32-year-old Type 1 diabetic who lost his job at a distribution center in Dubuque, Iowa, and with it, his health insurance. He was found dead in his home in February 2018, having run out of insulin. His last vials of the medication were given to him by a friend.",true,"Politics, pharmaceuticals"

They would not, however, be allowed to present that information to the general public in advertisements in the United Kingdom.",Alex Kasprak,"Myriad unfounded claims have been made of the UK’s Cancer Act of 1939, a law which some critics of the modern medical industry have suggested is part of a conspiracy to prevent a cure for cancer from being discovered so that “big pharma” can continue to profit from the disease unabated. In fact, the law prohibits any person from taking “any part in the publication of any advertisement … containing an offer to treat any person for cancer, or to prescribe any remedy therefor, or to give any advice in connection with the treatment thereof.” The act had other provisions when first passed, but the advertising portion is the only aspect of the act that remains on the books: Because it arrived nearly a decade before the founding of the NHS [National Health Service], the [Cancer] Act also contained details about how local councils should provide treatment and other services for cancer patients. And there was a whole section explaining how money should be allocated around the country to buy supplies of a radioactive element called radium — a forerunner of the far more sophisticated radiotherapy treatments we have today. All but one of these sections have now been repealed or subsumed into other pieces of legislation, and only one — section four — still stands. [Put simply, that section] is a blanket ban on advertising cancer treatments to the general public. One meme on the subject appearing online attempts to state as fact that the actually prevents anyone from curing cancer by criminalizing that activity:  First, since this law was passed by the British Parliament, no “medical practitioners” are being prosecuted “in America” under the law. More important, the act in no way prevents people from developing or researching cures for cancer. In fact, UK-based entities frequently fund research into cancer cures. The Act merely bars anyone (including UK drug manufacturers) from advertising they have a product that will “cure” cancer. The Act also does not, as claimed by Cannabis-culture website Herb, make it “illegal to promote, write about, or even speak about cancer therapies other than radiation.” That claim apparently stems from the way the act defines an advertisement: “In this section the expression ‘advertisement’ includes any notice, circular, label, wrapper or other document, and any announcement made orally or by any means of producing or transmitting sounds.” While the definition of what constitutes an advertisement is broad, the Act applies to the “publication” of an advertisement. The law was intended to protect patients from quacks and snake oil peddlers, a threat as real to cancer patients then as it is today. The few prosecutions that have taken place under the Act are in keeping with that spirit of the law. For example, a man named Jerry Sargeant, who calls himself “The Facilitator” and purports to have the ability to edit “people’s karmic blueprints through distance healing” (for the low price of £90 per quarter hour), claimed in several YouTube videos that his skills allowed him to rid people of cancer. He was found guilty of four violations under the Act and fined £4,700. In another example, a “life coach and naturopathic doctor” who calls himself Dr. Stephen Ferguson (who is not a medical doctor, but has a PhD in nutrition and hypnosis), claimed that multiple patients of his had been “cured” of cancer thanks to vitamin supplements and protein shakes sold on his website. He was fined £1,750 for violating the Act.",false,"Medical, big pharma, cancer"
568,41862,"Said Democrats manufactured a death toll of 3,000 for Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico to make him ""look as bad as possible.","September 13, 2018","In a pair of early morning tweets, President Donald Trump rejected Puerto Rico’s official estimate of 2,975 hurricane-related deaths after Hurricane Maria and, in the process, made some false and misleading claims.",Eugene Kiely,"In a pair of early morning tweets, President Donald Trump rejected Puerto Rico’s official estimate of 2,975 hurricane-related deaths after Hurricane Maria and, in the process, made some false and misleading claims:With parts of the East Coast bracing for Hurricane Florence, the president in recent days has praised his administration’s handling of past hurricanes.At the White House on Sept. 11, Trump said his administration deserves “A-plusses” for its response last year in Texas during Hurricane Harvey and in Florida for Hurricane Irma.He also said the administration’s handling of Puerto Rico during and after Hurricane Maria was “incredibly successful,” although the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a July report acknowledged that it was caught short-handed when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. Emergency supplies — including water, cots and tarps — were in short supply because weeks earlier they had been diverted from Puerto Rico to help victims of Hurricane Irma.“In response to Hurricane Irma impacts, FEMA distributed more than 80 percent of its inventory for selected commodities from the Caribbean Distribution Center warehouse [in San Juan, Puerto Rico],” FEMA’s report said. “Hurricane Maria struck before supplies were replenished.”But Trump’s praise for his administration’s response to Hurricane Maria largely drew criticism from some because of the high number of estimated deaths attributed to the storm.On Aug. 28, the Milken Institute School of Public Health released a report estimating that there were 2,975 “excess deaths in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Maria” over about a six-month period, from September 2017 through the end of February 2018.“The President keeps adding insult to injury and I think his words are despicable,” San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz told CNN. “He says he has done a good job when 3,000 people have died.”On Sept. 13, Trump rejected Puerto Rico’s official estimate in two early morning tweets.3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000…— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2018…..This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2018Let’s get some of the easy stuff out of the way, beginning with the president’s criticism of the Democrats and the report’s methodology.It’s not true that the higher death estimate “was done by the Democrats in order to make [Trump] look as bad as possible.” It was an independent study commissioned by Puerto Rico and undertaken by researchers at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health.In February, Puerto Rico announced that the Milken Institute School of Public Health would lead a study of “deaths associated with Hurricane Maria after its passage through the Island.”At the time, Puerto Rico had estimated that there were 64 deaths caused by Hurricane Maria, but the estimate was considered low because of the lingering effects that the hurricane had on the island. For example, nearly half of Puerto Rico’s residents were still without power at the end of the year — more than three months after the devastating storm had passed.“The methodology will seek to analyze all data available related to mortality, including death certificates, to determine how many more deaths than usual could be related to the hurricane,” Puerto Rico said in announcing the study.Trump also misrepresented the study’s methodology, claiming it counted deaths “for any reason, like old age.”The researchers did an “excess mortality study,” which takes into account the usual number of deaths that could be expected from September 2017 through February 2018. The 2,975 figure is the estimated number of “excess” deaths that researchers say occurred during that time.Table 1 of the report shows the number of “observed,” “predicted” and “excess” number of deaths during the post-hurricane period. There were 16,608 “observed” deaths and 13,633 “predicted” deaths — meaning that 2,975 “excess deaths” were “related to Hurricane Maria.”The “predicted” number of deaths was based on “past mortality patterns,” including deaths and population, from 2010 to 2017. People dying of “old age,” as Trump put it, would be part of the “predicted” number, not the “excess” number.The 2,975 figure is not an exact count of hurricane-related deaths. But the researchers said they are 95 percent confident that the number of direct and indirect deaths falls between 2,658 and 3,290.In his tweet, the president ignored the number of indirect hurricane-related deaths that occurred after the storm, as opposed to those directly caused by the storm.Trump recalled that when he visited Puerto Rico after the hurricane there were “anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths” caused by the storm. That’s not wrong. Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island on Sept. 19, 2017, and Trump visited Puerto Rico on Oct. 3, 2017. At the time, he was told that the death toll stood at 16. He said to those in attendance that they should be “very proud” of the number of deaths compared with those caused by Hurricane Katrina.“If you look at the — every death is a horror,” he said. “But if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering — nobody has ever seen anything like this.”After all this time, however, we now know that the death toll was much higher than 18. As we said, the official death toll as of February was 64 deaths — but even then the number was considered too low.In an April report, the National Hurricane Center said the death toll in Puerto Rico was “highly uncertain” and there could be hundreds of direct and indirect hurricane-related deaths.“In Puerto Rico, the death toll is highly uncertain and the official number stands at 65, which includes an unknown number of indirect deaths,” the report said. “It should be noted that hundreds of additional indirect deaths in Puerto Rico may eventually be attributed to Maria’s aftermath pending the results of an official government review.”Katrina is a good example of the uncertainty associated with documenting deaths from hurricanes.For example, the National Hurricane Center in December 2005 — several months after the storm — issued a report on Katrina that put the death toll at 1,833 (about 1,500 directly related to Katrina and several hundred indirectly) in five states. That estimate was based on “reports to date from state and local officials in five states.” (That figure has since been revised down to 1,100. )Other research has produced different numbers.Louisiana State Epidemiologist Raoult Ratard co-authored a study with researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and concluded, in a paper published in August 2008, that there were 971 Katrina-related deaths in Louisiana and 15 deaths among Katrina evacuees in other states. (A follow-up study also co-authored by Ratard revised the number to 1,170.) Both studies analyzed death certificates and autopsy reports as well as the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team’s confirmed victims database for the two months immediately after the storm. Drowning was the most common cause of death (40 percent), followed by injury and trauma (25 percent) and heart conditions (11 percent).But in a phone interview, Ratard told us that methodology might not be the best to use to gauge storm-related deaths in Puerto Rico.The storms in Louisiana and Puerto Rico are “two different situations,” Ratard told us, and so comparing the methods used to track deaths doesn’t make sense. In Louisiana, many people evacuated shortly after the storm, making it difficult for researchers to track long-term effects of the storm. And so, he said, they stuck to documenting what happened during the flood and the immediate aftermath.In Puerto Rico, the situation was different, Ratard said. No one could evacuate. So it’s entirely appropriate, he said, to look at the mortality rates in the months after the storm and compare them to similar periods in past years.“I can see why they used the methods they used,” he said. “In Puerto Rico, it was easier to document the long-term impact.”“My impression is that they have a valid point in estimating the long-term effects” in Puerto Rico, he said. From what he knows about the research, he said, “it sounds reasonable to me.”Although Trump ignores the indirect deaths attributed to Hurricane Maria, the National Hurricane Center is interested in indirect deaths and makes an attempt to count them.In August 2016, Edward N. Rappaport, the deputy director of the NHC, and B. Wayne Blanchard, then with FEMA, wrote about indirect deaths in the journal of the American Meteorological Society. They wrote that “direct deaths do not tell the whole story. They do not include the important class of indirect fatalities–casualties that, while not directly attributable to one of the physical forces of a tropical cyclone, would not be expected in the absence of the storm. These losses can occur in significant numbers.”John Mutter, professor of earth and environmental sciences and of international and public affairs at Columbia University, has studied the impact of natural disasters and the death toll of Hurricane Katrina. Mutter told us that it’s difficult to measure the death toll from hurricanes for several reasons, including deciding when to start counting and when to stop, and whether various deaths should be considered hurricane-related. “A lot of people die from the exacerbation of preexisting conditions,” particularly the elderly, he said.People also go missing, and a lot of people can die in the aftermath. But how long should the “aftermath” be?“There are no rules about this,” Mutter said, “no uniform standard on when you start or when you stop.”But both of the experts we interviewed said the methodology used by the researchers at the Milken Institute School of Public Health was reasonable — contrary to the president’s tweet questioning the high death toll estimate, the methodology used by the researchers and the motivation of the Puerto Rico government in seeking the best estimate.Mutter said the study was using “tried and true methodologies” to get an estimate, which will have some admitted uncertainty. Such statistical models are often used in estimates of civilian casualties in conflicts, he said.In a statement, the Milken Institute School of Public Health stood by its “state-of-the-art mathematical model” and the findings that it produced. Hurricane Maria was “a very deadly storm” and “the number – 2,975 – is the most accurate and unbiased estimate of excess mortality to date,” it said.It’s not clear what Trump meant when he wrote, “I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico.” We didn’t receive a response to emails we sent to the White House for clarification.The federal government certainly has appropriated billions of dollars in disaster relief for Puerto Rico. In June, the Puerto Rico newspaper El Nuevo Día reported that “promised federal allocations” for the U.S. territory “total about $31.6 billion,” according to its analysis. The majority of that — about $20 billion— was awarded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development through its Community Development Block Grant — Disaster Recovery Program.At the time, El Nuevo Día noted that the amount appropriated by the government was about one-third of the $94.4 billion that Puerto Rico estimated in November it would need to rebuild. Then, in August, the island increased its request to Congress to $139 billion.In addition to those federal funds, Trump’s inauguration committee announced late last September that it was donating $3 million to three different charities involved in the hurricane relief efforts. That was not long after the Associated Press reported that the committee, which had raised $107 million for Trump’s inauguration ceremonies, had not donated any of its leftover money to charity, as it had pledged to do.",false," Hurricane Maria, "

Even more, their research is more than a decade old, and they say fingerprint matching technology has changed since then. Pratt’s statement is not based on solid evidence.",Katie Sanders,"The debate over ""smart guns"" doesn’t always turn up accurate talking points. Exhibit A: Sarah Palin telling the National Rifle Association crowd about a (nonexistent) federal plan to make gun owners wear ""special bracelets that would identify you as a gun owner."" Exhibit B: MSNBC host Chris Hayes’ recent on-air shouting match with Larry Pratt, executive director of the lobbying group Gun Owners of America. Smart guns -- also known as ""child-proof guns"" and ""personalized guns"" -- are designed to work solely for authorized users through features like fingerprint recognition or electronic sensors. The hope is they will reduce deaths by suicide, accidental shootings or someone stealing a law enforcement officer’s weapon. They are not sold in the United States, though two dealers tried before backing down amid intense pressure from activists. Hayes supports the technology, but Pratt and other gun-rights advocates are skeptical. Pratt questions the guns’ reliability, saying smart guns are ""only 80 percent effective."" When Hayes pressed Pratt for the source of his statistic, Pratt cited the New Jersey Institute of Technology. ""Twenty percent of the time it won’t work,"" Pratt said. ""And you’re asking people to put their lives in the hands of a product like that?"" Later, Pratt used the figure again. ""Is it okay to put on the market a car that 20 percent of the time explodes on you and causes you harm or death?"" Since Pratt tripled down on his statistic, PunditFact wanted to check it out. Tracing the source of the claim Pratt pointed to a 2003 column in Popular Mechanics magazine headlined ""‘Smart’ Guns: Dumb Idea!"" The column was inspired by a 2002 New Jersey law that requires all guns sold in the state to have ""smart"" technology within three years of the attorney general verifying the first smart gun was sold in the United States. Fear among gun rights activists that more government mandates may come when this happens drive their opposition to smart guns. In his column 11 years ago, writer Cliff Gromer said law enforcement officers are exempt from the law, which proves the technology isn’t solid enough for the mainstream gun market. ""According to the New Jersey Institute of Technology, which used government grants to study personalized handgun technology, fingerprint recognition systems work only 80 percent of the time,"" Gromer wrote. ""But the New Jersey law goes into effect regardless of whether the guns are 100 percent -- or 80 percent -- reliable."" Article is not the smoking gun You may have read over it, but the 80 percent figure Gromer cited talks about fingerprint recognition systems. Not whether a smart gun will work. That’s important because while some smart guns use fingerprint recognition systems (which work like the new unlocking method for iPhones), not all do. The German-made Armatix iP1 .22 caliber pistol was expected to be the first smart gun sold in the United States this year until a California gun store owner scrapped plans to sell it after facing aggressive backlash. It happened again with a Maryland dealer. The Armatix does not have a fingerprint recognition system. Instead, the gun works with a black stopwatch and PIN code that emits radio signals to the gun to make it active. The signal is akin to what’s emitted from those bulky tags on mall merchandise that aren’t triggered until taken out of the store. Other models work with similar chips implanted in everyday accessories, such as bracelets, pins and rings, and some are implanted in the body. If the badge is too far away from the microchip in the gun, it will stop working. But that means the technology works, not that it failed. And, more critically, the Armatix radio signal has nothing to do with the study Pratt cited, which focused on fingerprint recognition systems, New Jersey Institute of Technology researchers told us. Other smart guns also avoid fingerprint technology. Michael Recce, an associate professor in the information systems department at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, invented ""dynamic grip recognition"" and applied it to a gun, so that it fires only after it recognizes the user’s grip thanks to sensors on the side of the gun that detect pressure and the contours of the user's hand. The gun starts to detect if the user is authorized as someone starts pulling the gun, he said. Recce said the owner detection rate for his dynamic grip ""is within the mechanical failure rate,"" i.e. the rate at which a standard gun fails. However, two or three people out of 100 adults could also fire the gun in trials because their hand is similar to the owner’s -- a tradeoff with the technology so it is sure to fire for the rightful owner, he said. Other types of smart guns in varying stages of development are outlined in a year-old National Institute of Justice report commissioned as part of President Barack Obama’s gun reforms after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings. This research is dated In this case, the New Jersey Institute of Technology research is being misapplied, and it’s old. Researchers told us their work on fingerprint scanners should not be applied to newer guns. Their research, which was not published, was done in the early 2000s on four types of guns using fingerprint readers. None of those guns were as reliable as mechanical firearms, they found, though the guns were a ""fragile technology"" then, said Donald Sebastian, New Jersey Institute of Technology senior vice president for research and development. ""Fingerprint readers may have progressed in the past 10 years,"" Recce said. ""At that time even the readers on laptops would often require you to swipe your finger more than once before they worked. Our opinion was that swiping your finger over the reader multiple times would be a challenge when using a gun."" Skeptics of these guns point to many concerns about the reliability of the weapons in a high-pressure situation, like who has time to enter a PIN code, and what if the sensors in the gun die? Michael Bazinet, a National Shooting Sports Foundation spokesman, said the ""strongest statement on their reliability"" will be when law enforcement officers use them en masse. But other potential weaknesses don’t change the fact that what Pratt cited is old news. ""To make a universal blanket statement based on a 15-year-old analysis of fingerprint detectors just doesn’t pass muster,"" Sebastian said. ""It’s like talking about the reliability of a Model T and comparing it to a race car. Apples and oranges."" If not 80 percent reliable, then what? Finding a reliability rate for smart guns is an ""almost unanswerable question,"" said Stephen Teret, a pro-smart gun Johns Hopkins professor and director of the university’s Center for Law and the Public’s Health. ""Because there’s a wide range of quality in existing guns, some are better, some are worse. So when you are trying to compute a rate of reliability, are you using one gun or various categories?"" Robert Spitzer, a SUNY Cortland political science professor and author of The Politics of Gun Control (whom Hayes brought in after Pratt to talk about the issue), said in order for the Armatix iP1 gun to be sold in California, it had to pass a reliability test. ""The standard was a 99 percent successful fire rate, which it met (fire 600 times with 6 or fewer failed discharges),"" Spitzer said. Others stressed that all guns are prone to failure at some point. The mechanical failure rate is often given as 1 in 1,000, and a military weapon’s failure rate is closer to 1 in 10,000, Sebastian said. ""Misfire is embedded in our language,"" he said. Our ruling Pratt said ""20 percent of the time (smart guns) won't work,"" which he got from a 2003 magazine story referencing unpublished research from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. The scientists who conducted that research say Pratt’s citation is misapplied. Researchers only looked at smart guns that rely on fingerprint sensors, yet Pratt applied the statistic to all smart guns, including the Armatix pistol that works with a black stopwatch, PIN code and small electronic chips. Even more, their research is more than a decade old, and they say fingerprint matching technology has changed since then. Pratt’s statement is not based on solid evidence.

572,41841,Claimed his administration recently provided “historic levels of funding to improve school safety” through the STOP School Violence Act. ,"October 11, 2018",President Donald Trump boasted that his administration recently provided “historic levels of funding to improve school safety” and “hire more officers” through the newly created STOP School Violence Act. But the new law does not fund school safety at “historic levels.”,Eugene Kiely,"At an event for law enforcement officials, President Donald Trump boasted that his administration recently provided “historic levels of funding to improve school safety” and “hire more officers” through the newly created STOP School Violence Act. But the new law does not fund school safety at “historic levels.”An omnibus spending bill the president signed in March included the STOP School Violence Act, and shifted $75 million from an existing school safety program to STOP School Violence programs. But a single program created in the late 1990s and since disbanded, called COPS in Schools, provided as much as $180 million in fiscal year 2000, according to a 2017 government report. That’s $260 million in 2018 dollars.The president spoke about the STOP School Violence grants in his remarks to the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Orlando, Florida.Trump, Oct. 8: Last week, my administration also provided historic levels of funding to improve school safety. Through STOP School Violence grants, we are giving local schools and police departments the resources they need to hire more officers, and train more teachers, and better detect and address early warning signs of mental illness before it’s too late.The White House said the president was referring to the STOP School Violence Act and the programs it funds.On Oct. 2, the Department of Justice announced that it had awarded more than $70 million for school safety through the STOP School Violence Act. A week earlier, Attorney General Jeff Sessions had announced $200,000 in funding to the National Association of School Resource Officers “to expand and update their curriculum to better support training programs,” the announcement said.The STOP School Violence Act was created by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, an omnibus bill that the president signed in March. The omnibus spending bill provided $75 million to the STOP School Violence Act to address school violence. The Bureau of Justice Assistance, or BJA, received $50 million, and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS Office, received $25 million in grant money.“BJA received $50 million to provide grants to states, units of local government, and Indian tribes. These grants are used for the training of teachers and the education of students to prevent student violence, and to support threat assessments, crisis intervention teams, and the use of technology for anonymous reporting,” Alan R. Hanson, a principal deputy assistant attorney general, explained to Congress in written testimony to a House subcommittee in July. “The balance ($25 million) was provided to the COPS Office to provide grants for law enforcement training and coordination to prevent school violence and for a variety of school safety equipment (e.g., metal detectors, locks, lighting) and alerting technologies.”When the president signed the spending bill, Education Week noted that it “shifts funds from an existing, wide-ranging school safety grant program toward the new STOP School Violence Act.”Education Week, March 23: The final budget takes $75 million appropriated for the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative — an existing program in the Department of Justice that funds research and implementation of a wide range of evidence-based safety programs that range from bullying prevention to innovative approaches to school policing — and redirects that funding toward programs authorized under the STOP School Violence Act.On its website, the National Criminal Justice Reference Service notified potential grantees that the “NIJ has canceled the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative.”“With the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, the funding planned for these solicitations is no longer available for research and evaluation,” the cancellation notice said. “Instead, it will be used for other purposes under the Stop School Violence Act of 2018.”The National Institute of Justice website says the program, before it was cancelled, provided $246 million from fiscal years 2014 through 2017. That’s an annual average of $61.5 million, with a high in funding of $69 million in fiscal 2015. With inflation, the $69 million in fiscal 2015 is a few million less than the $75 million provided this year for STOP School Violence grants.So, it’s true that the $75 million for the STOP School Violence Act is more than what Congress had appropriated for the program it replaced, the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative. That program received a low of $42 million in fiscal 2017, the last year of funding.However, the COPS in Schools program in the late 1990s and early 2000s provided much more funding for school safety than the grants awarded under the STOP School Violence Act.A 2017 government report detailed the history of federal funding for school safety programs from 1990 to 2016. The report said that then-President Bill Clinton in 1998 held “the first White House Conference on School Safety,” which resulted in the formation of two major school safety grant programs.“During his keynote address, Clinton announced two new large-scale school safety discretionary grant programs: the COPS in Schools program to fund the hiring and training of school resource officers, and the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative to fund interagency, community-based violence prevention and behavioral health programs for school-age children and youth,” the report said.The COPS in Schools program was administered by the DOJ’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS Office — the same office that received $25 million under the STOP School Violence Act. The federal report on school safety programs called COPS in Schools “the largest sustained federal effort to support SROs.”Between 1999 and 2005, the COPS in Schools, or CIS, program awarded $823.7 million in grants to law enforcement agencies to support the hiring of more than 7,000 school resource officers. At its peak, the COPS in Schools program issued grants totaling $180 million in fiscal year 2000 — which is the equivalent of about $260 million in 2018 dollars. (See Table 11 in the report for COPS in Schools funds.) That’s nearly four times the STOP School Violence grants.“Annual appropriations for the CIS program total $167.5 million in FY1999, $180.0 million in FY2000, $179.6 million in FY2001, $180.0 million in FY2002, $39.7 million in FY2003, $59.4 million in FY2004, and $4.9 million in FY2005,” the report said.The Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative — a more broadly designed program that dealt with issues that included drug use, bullying and dropout prevention — provided “more than $2 billion in funding and other resources to 365 communities in 49 states” from fiscal years 1999 through 2012, the report said.The report noted that the peak in federal funding for school safety occurred in the “early to mid-2000s.”“After peaking in the early to mid-2000s — a period during which several national-level school safety initiatives were active and receiving substantial appropriations — federal funding for school safety declined in the following decade,” the report said.A February report on school safety by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said that Congress might want to consider restarting the dormant COPS in Schools program.CRS, Feb. 23, 2018: In late 1990s and 2000s, Congress appropriated funding for two programs that provided funding for physical school security measures, the Matching Grant Program for School Security and the COPS in Schools program. However, neither program has been funded for several years. Policymakers might consider whether to revive these programs to help support school security efforts, especially if Congress is looking for an avenue to provide funding to schools for installation of physical security measures.Instead, Congress passed the STOP School Violence Act, which provided grants at a level well below the COPS in Schools grants — despite Trump’s claim that the new law provided “historic levels of funding.”",false," government spending, school shooting, school violence, "
573,29603,Several major brands of lipstick contain dangerous levels of cancer-causing lead which can be detected with a gold ring.,"July 28, 2003",Lipstick and Lead: Questions and Answers (U.S. Food and Drug Administration,David Mikkelson,"This terrifying warning about danger lurking in lipstick began frightening the makeup-wearing public in May 2003, even as it apparently offered them a way to protect themselves from dangerous products via a simple test which could supposedly identify a threat to their wellbeing: Example: [Collected via e-mail, July 2003] This is how to test Lipstick for “Lead”, lead is a chemical which causes cancer.

Market America-Motives lipstick 0 The higher the number of lead the higher the content which means a greater chance of causing Cancer. After doing this test, we found Y.S.L. lipstick to contain the most lead. It is not easy to “REMOVE” because of the lead. Watch out for those lipsticks which are suppose to stay longer Here is the test you can do yourself: 1. Put some lipstick on your hand, 2. Use a 24k-14k Gold ring to scratch on the lipstick. 3. If the lipstick color changes to black then you know the lipstick contains lead. Please send this information to all your girl friends. Lead may not necessarily cause cancer, but it most assuredly is an element dangerous to humans; one they should make every effort to distance themselves from. Exposure to lead can cause a range of deleterious health effects, from behavioral problems and learning disabilities to seizures and death. Children 6 years old and under are most at risk because their bodies are growing quickly, thus additional care has to be taken to protect them from exposure to this common element. In the past, many house paints were lead-based and the solder commonly used on plumbing joints contained lead, bringing this killer into numerous unsuspecting households. But lead awareness has improved in recent years, as have regulations restricting the use of lead in goods or products average consumers might have contact with. In this respect, our houses today are far safer than those of our parents and grandparents. But what about the presence of lead in cosmetics? Although many dangerous substances (including lead) have been utilized as ingredients at various times in the history of makeup, and some women of earlier days caused themselves life-long health problems (or even managed to kill themselves) with beautifiers that amounted to death in a jar, what goes into cosmetics these days is much more regulated, controlled, and fully understood. While in the past anything and everything got tossed into the paintbox without anyone’s knowing what could cause harm and what was safe to use, our modern world at least has safer cosmetics going for it. We spoke with a compliance officer at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the possibility of lead being present in lipsticks. All dyes used in foodstuffs or cosmetics have to be vetted by the FDA for safety, and although some of the colorants the FDA grants approval to do contain lead, it is present in such miniscule amounts that it has no adverse effects on consumers. Manufacturers who wish to do business in the USA are restricted to the use of FDA-certifiable colors only; otherwise their products will not be allowed in the country or onto the shelves of American stores. Each of these approved dyes has its own rigid set of specifications which must be adhered to. For instance, F&C Red #6 cannot contain more than 20 parts per million of lead (also not more than 3 parts per million of arsenic or 1 part per million of mercury). As for how stringent these requirements are, every time a manufacturer prepares a batch of dye for use in its products, it has to submit a sample from that batch to the FDA for certification. The FDA’s certification process is exhaustive and exhausting. And only the FDA can certify colors as safe — no one else has that authority. The FDA further regulates the selection of dyes manufacturers can incorporate into their products according to the proposed end uses of the items in question. Thus, products intended for use on mucous membranes can contain only certain FDA-approved dyes rather than drawing from the full spectrum of approved dyes. Because the lips are considered mucous membranes, lipstick manufacturers may make their colorant selections only from this reduced pool. Occasionally, small-scale studies (such as one in 2006 and another in 2007) report detecting amounts of lead that exceed the FDA limits for candy (0.1 PPM) in some brands of lipstick, resulting in news reports with alarming headlines such as “Lipstick Found to Contain Hazardous Levels of Lead!” The comparison with candy is made because the FDA has not yet issued specific standards for lead content in lipstick (and so news or consumer watchdog associations choose sweets as a comparison product), but this match up is not an apt one: people eat whole pieces of candy; they don’t merely smear their lips with thin coatings of it. Also, unlike candy, lipstick is rarely eaten by the bagful. It therefore goes without saying that regulatory standards governing the lead content of items we eat (sometimes in great quantity) must be far more restrictive than those governing items that take us years to go through. (And no, there’s no truth to the old saw about the average woman’s swallowing six pounds of lipstick during her lifetime.) A December 2011 study conducted by the FDA found the average lead concentration in the 400 lipsticks it tested for that substance was 1.11 ppm, with results ranging from the detection limit of 0.026 ppm to the highest value of 7.19 ppm. The FDA said regarding safety concerns about the lead levels it found in lipsticks: “We have assessed the potential for harm to consumers from use of lipstick containing lead at the levels found in both rounds of testing. Lipstick, as a product intended for topical use with limited absorption, is ingested only in very small quantities. We do not consider the lead levels we found in the lipsticks to be a safety concern. The lead levels we found are within the limits recommended by other public health authorities for lead in cosmetics, including lipstick.” Likewise, a research study conducted in 2013 by UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health found that lead was present in 24 of the 32 lipstick samples they tested, but at levels that were within safety guidelines (estimated lead intake for the product with the highest lead concentration was between 3% and 12% of the acceptable daily intake). The cited FDA limit of 0.1 ppm is for lead in “candy likely to be consumed frequently by small children,” but lipstick is rarely used by small children (who are much more susceptible to contaminants such as lead) at all, let alone frequently. Finally, until very recently the FDA limits for lead in candy were five times higher than they are now. This puts the amounts of lead found in that 2007 examination of lipsticks into a bit better perspective: In 2006 the FDA limit on lead in candy meant for children was 0.5 ppm, and the highest amounts of lead in lipstick uncovered by The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics in 2007 were 0.65 ppm, followed by 0.58 ppm and 0.56 ppm, with all other lipsticks it examined falling well below the 0.5 ppm mark (4th in line was 0.28 ppm). The FDA said about the reasonableness of comparing lead levels found in lipstick to the limit established for candy that: ” The FDA-recommended upper limit for lead in candy is 0.1 ppm. It is not scientifically valid to equate the risk to consumers presented by lead levels in candy, a product intended for ingestion, with that associated with lead levels in lipstick, a product intended for topical use and ingested in much smaller quantities than candy.” As to what the limit on lead in lipstick should be, a 25 July 1990 Cosmetics, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association memo about the use of “carbon black” in cosmetics noted: “CTFA has proposed that residues of lead and arsenic be limited to a maximum of 20 ppm and 2 ppm, respectively,” which is 100 to 50 times the level discovered in reports about lead found in lipstick. (Now, granted, that CTFA proposal had to do with a particular component of the cosmetic rather than the whole of the product itself. But even so, it’s reasonable to conclude the amount of lead in those lead-bearing lipsticks fell well within the broad range of what the FDA considers innocuous.) Despite initial inability to see the resultant streaks, further tests conducted under strong light by rubbing various metals across lipstick smears made on sheets of white paper produced dark brown marks. Rubs of pewter, copper, silver, and gold across samples drawn from three Revlon Colorstay Lipcolors left dark streaks in their wakes; rubs of stainless steel did not. Even coins produced reactions, with dimes and nickels leaving discernable streaks, although pennies did not. (Which is not all that surprising, given the reaction to copper noted above. Pennies are 2.5% copper and 97.5% zinc; nickels are 75% copper and 25% nickel, and dimes are 91.67% copper and 8.33% nickel.) All reactions were more noticeable against streaks of lighter-colored lipstick. Yet the interests of science carried me further, especially after a call to Revlon failed to yield anything that would help explain what component of the cosmetic was reacting to those metals. Remembering that lipstick is (at its most basic) oil, wax, and color, I rubbed the four metals across swipes of wax made on white paper, and again saw dark streaks, albeit gray ones. Curiosity then inspired me to make yet another test with the four metals, this time against plain white paper. And once again, the gray streaks were there. The streaks that supposedly herald the presence of lead in one’s lipstick are in reality dark marks produced by the testing agents themselves. Gold, silver, copper, and pewter leave these trails no matter what they’re rubbed against, in the same way that pencils make marks on whatever surfaces they are trailed along. That these marks appear more prominent against a lipstick backdrop is attributable to contrast — streaks that look gray against a white background seem brown against a reddish background, and brown is a color more readily discerned by the eye. The bottom line is that U.S. medical literature has yet to record a single case of anyone’s coming down with lead poisoning through lipstick use. (And, in any case, contrary to what is claimed in the alarming e-mail quoted above, contracting cancer is not one of the recorded adverse health effects one is likely to suffer through excessive exposure to lead.) Of course, all of this information applies to lipstick legally produced and sold in the U.S. When it comes to unauthorized imports and counterfeit cosmetics that evade the scrutiny of government regulatory agencies, all bets are off.

Stricter containment measures were planned elsewhere as well. Honghu city in Hubei province imposed a “wartime” lock-down beginning on Friday, with strict management of entry into housing compounds and villages, according to an official social media account of the local police, China’s CCTV reported. Hubei officials said there were 2,420 new cases on Friday and 139 more deaths. A top Chinese official, in an interview with Reuters, acknowledged that coronavirus was a huge challenge, but defended Beijing’s management of the epidemic and lashed out at the “overreaction” of some countries. State Councillor Wang Yi, who also serves as China’s foreign minister, said China has taken decisive measures to fight the epidemic, many going beyond international health regulations and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. “Through our efforts the epidemic is overall under control,” he said. China is struggling to get the world’s second largest economy going after the annual Lunar New Year holiday, which was extended by 10 days to help contain the highly contagious virus. Including the latest numbers from Hubei at the epicenter of the outbreak, the total number of cases in mainland China now exceeds 66,000, with more than 1,500 deaths. The figures show no sign that the outbreak is nearing a peak, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Center for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney. With 500 million people already affected by movement and travel restrictions, President Xi Jinping warned top officials last week that efforts to contain the virus had gone too far and were threatening the economy, sources said. In Beijing and the business hub Shanghai, streets and subways remain largely deserted with many shops and restaurants empty or shut. Government employee Jin Yang, 28, made it to his Beijing office and found it “anything but normal.”  Canteen lunches are banned in favor of boxed meals eaten at desks. Meetings are held online, not in person. Employees must wear masks all day and report their temperature twice a day as fever is one of the virus’ main symptoms. Outside mainland China, there have been nearly 450 cases in some 24 countries and territories, and three deaths. Japan confirmed its first coronavirus death on Thursday. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. WUHAN’S SELF-HELP  Wuhan, the central Chinese city of 11 million people where the outbreak began, has been hardest hit by the virus. With all public transport, taxis and ride-hailing services shut down in the city, volunteer drivers are responding to requests on ad hoc messaging groups to ferry medical staff and others in vital jobs to and from work, risking their own health. Others work round the clock to find accommodation for medical workers in hotels that have volunteered rooms. Graphic: Comparing new coronavirus to SARS and MERS - here  “Everyone in our group has such a strong sense of mission,” said 53-year-old Chen Hui, who runs one of the ad hoc ride services. The virus is killing around 2% of those infected, but has spread faster than other respiratory viruses that emerged this century. A WHO-led joint mission with China will start its outbreak investigation work this weekend, focusing on how the new coronavirus is spreading and its severity, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The mission will also seek more details on how, where and when the more than 1,700 healthworkers infected contracted the new virus, WHO officials said. The mission will also look into what “information is needed so that the world can use this window of opportunity to prepare health systems and workers for possible outbreaks,” Tedros said. Economists polled by Reuters said China’s economic downturn would be short-lived if the outbreak was contained, but expected this quarter would show China’s slowest growth rate since the global financial crisis. The Chinese carmakers’ association said auto sales in China were likely to slide more than 10% in the first half of the year because of the epidemic. Vietnam has imposed a 20-day quarantine on Son Loi, a rural community outside Hanoi where 11 of the country’s 16 coronavirus cases are located, two local officials said. The virus is taking its toll on the $46 billion global ocean cruise industry. The biggest cluster of infections outside China has been on a cruise liner quarantined in a Japanese port, with 218 people on board infected and taken to hospital. On Friday, some passengers were allowed to disembark to complete their quarantine on shore.",true,Health News

Only 1,399,000,000 cases to go until it matches the 1.4 billion cases of H1N1 in 2009. 51,560 deaths and only 525,000 to go to match H1N1.I am sure am glad we wrecked the economy over this, aren’t you?According to Mitchell, a total 1.4 billion people were infected during the H1N1 pandemic, and 576,560 (525,000 + 51,560) people died globally during the swine flu pandemic.Actual NumbersMitchell didn’t provide a citation for his sources in the April 2 2020 tweet above, but the 1.4 billion statistic (and a similar mortality figure) appeared in a March 18 2020 LiveScience article:It’s been a little over a decade since the world experienced its last pandemic, the 2009 H1N1 swine flu. Between the spring of 2009 and the spring of 2010, the virus infected as many as 1.4 billion people across the globe and killed between 151,700 and 575,400 people, according to the Centers for Disease Protection and Control. Now, the world is in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.The context of that reporting was relevant. Although Mitchell claimed that there were “1.4 billion cases of H1N1 in 2009” and just under 600,000 deaths, LiveScience included ranges for both:Reference to “as many as” and “between” alluded to a range of estimates, and Mitchell sifted out the absolute highest numbers to attempt to make his point.But even that short excerpt contained additional context — namely, that those figures were compiled well after the H1N1 pandemic had ended. Comparing rates of infections and deaths at the beginning of a pandemic versus years after one ends is obviously going to yield misleading and unsteady comparisons, since as of April 2 2020, a large number of people had yet to fall ill with or die from COVID-19.LiveScience.com cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for its statistic, and linked to this page (“2009 H1N1 Pandemic.”) The number 1.4 billion does not appear anywhere on that page, and the statistic appears to have been extrapolated from either this portion:Though the 2009 flu pandemic primarily affected children and young and middle-aged adults, the impact of the (H1N1)pdm09 virus on the global population during the first year was less severe than that of previous pandemics. Estimates of pandemic influenza mortality ranged from 0.03 percent of the world’s population during the 1968 H3N2 pandemic to 1 percent to 3 percent of the world’s population during the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. It is estimated that 0.001 percent to 0.007 percent of the world’s population died of respiratory complications associated with (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first 12 months the virus circulated.Or from 2013 estimates that one in five people globally had contracted H1N1 in 2009 and 2010:The study, which used data from 19 countries, collated results from more than 24 studies involving some 90,000 blood samples collected before, during and after the pandemic. The results, published in the journal Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses, showed 20 to 27 percent of people studied were infected during the first year of the pandemic.Once again, those figures were the high end of a range, and estimated.Interim COVID-19 Infections and DeathsIncidentally, 22 days after Mitchell’s tweet, on April 24 2020, nearly 200,000 people worldwide had died of COVID-19 (and more than 50 thousand of those deaths were in the United States):Does the United States Have 4 Percent of the World’s Population and 25 Percent of the Deaths from COVID-19?Cherry picking in the same fashion Mitchell did could, for instance, support the argument that as of April 24 2020, more people died of COVID-19 early in the pandemic than had died in the lower range of estimates for the totality of the H1N1/swine flu pandemic (151,700).Pandemics and Wide Estimated RangesOn April 23 2020, we examined a different pandemic comparison on Twitter, and noted that even the modern attempts to piece together exact figures were inexact:Did the Second Wave of the 1918 Spanish Flu Kill 20 to 30 Million, While the First Wave Killed 3 to 5 Million?Figures on the high ended tended to included guesses or estimates about those mildly sickened or otherwise not counted officially, and researchers created such tallies in a variety of ways in order to better quantify the long-term effects of pandemics. Although research and medical study have advanced by leaps and bounds since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, limitations in counting unreported cases continued to clearly hinder researchers’ ability to hammer down extremely precise numbers — leaving ranges as wide as between “151,700 and 575,400” deaths during a 2009-2010 pandemic.In SummationMitchell claimed that 1.4 billion people were infected during the 2009-2010 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic, and over 575,000 people died. Mitchell seemed to deliberately select the absolute highest end of very wide ranges, figures assessed years after that pandemic had come and gone. Mitchell’s tweet also appeared at the beginning of the novel coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic, and within a few weeks, there had been more deaths globally (194,000) than the lowest range for the totality of the H1N1 pandemic (157,000).

So there’s room for healthy skepticism, as in this LA Times column.","Gary Schwitzer,Kevin Lomangino","The story includes the cost of several of the products mentioned. The story reported: “A September 2011 Cochrane Review of 14 studies found “weak” evidence that probiotics could help prevent the common cold and other upper respiratory infections in infants, children and younger adults. And an April 2011 study in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found a Lactobacillus probiotic seemed to improve the immune system’s response following a flu vaccination.” We would have preferred to read some of the actual data about “how weak” (in the Cochrane Review) and how much improvement in the other study. But we liked that the story quantified, via an independent expert, how many people might expect to avoid a cold by taking probiotics, if these “weak” studies are correct: “perhaps as few as 1 in 30.”  The “generally safe” line is too vague for us. There are side effects and risks associated with probiotic use. The article quotes Paul Forsythe, a respiratory specialist and assistant professor of medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “… as Forsythe noted in an April 2011 issue of the journal Chest, most of the research on probiotics has been conducted in mice, and the real-world immunity benefits for humans are uncertain. Companies “are taking evidence from animal studies and stretching their claims,” he says” No disease mongering. Independent sources contributed perspectives to this story. The story’s second paragraph briefly mentions some options: “Avoiding germs entirely would require something like solitary confinement or a head-to-toe application of Purell. As an alternative, many people try to do what they can to strengthen their immune systems. Vitamin C is old news, and echinacea and other herbs haven’t really panned out. “ The availability of these products is clear from the story. Not applicable; no overt claims of novelty were made. It’s clear that the story did not rely on a news release.",true,"common cold,Probiotics"

As interest in the case increased in February 2020, Horsford’s friends and loved ones pleaded with the public for further investigation into the circumstances of her death:The coroner’s death certificate listed Horsford’s death as an accident. The report said that a fall from a deck caused multiple blunt force injuries and “acute ethanol intoxication” was a contributing factor.But Michelle Graves says she believes something else happened to her best friend and the family hired another medical examiner who found extensive injuries all over her body.“It’s impossible to get the injuries that she had from one fall,” she said.Thousands on social media have called for further investigation into Horsford’s death with hashtags #TamlaHorsford and #JusticeForTamlaHorsford.“We’re glad we’re not the only ones who feel there’s something awry with the story and with how she lost her life,” Graves told Petchenik.The Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office said they just got back the toxicology reports this week [of February 20 2020] and plan to have answers soon.That article mentioned in passing that Forsyth County employee Jose Barrera had at that point recently been fired for allegedly improperly accessing documents related to the investigation into Horsford’s death. WSB-TV also reported that the party was held “at Barrera’s girlfriend house,” that “Barrera found Horsford lying face down in the backyard unresponsive, according to police reports,” and that Barrera said in a 911 call on the morning Horsford’s body was found:“I’m noticing a small cut on her right wrist. She’s not breathing whatsoever. I don’t know if this cut was self-inflicted.”On February 20 2020, the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office in Forsyth County, Georgia issued a press release regarding the findings of the medical examiner in an investigation into Horsford’s death, and indicated that the office had closed the investigation:February 20, 2019 On November 4th, 2018, at 8:59 AM, the Forsyth County 911 Center received a call of an unresponsive person in the 4000 block of Woodlet Ct in Cumming, Georgia. First responders were dispatched and the Sheriff’s Deputies arrived at 9:07 AM. Deputies discovered the clothed body of a deceased female lying in the backyard of the residence. The deceased female was later identified as 40-year-old Tamala Horsford of Cumming Georgia. Mrs. Horsford had been attending an overnight party at the residence. […]While the injuries sustained by Mrs. Horsford appeared to likely be received in a fall, Detectives awaited results from both the toxicology and the Medical Examiner reports to verify their findings. On February 6th, 2019, the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office received the final Medical Examiner’s report regarding Mrs. Horsford. The State of Georgia Medical Examiner has ruled the death accidental and consistent with a fall. Detectives have spent the following weeks reviewing the medical findings with those found at the scene by the Major Crimes Unit and the Crime Scene Investigation Unit. No evidence or injury patterns indicative of an assault or foul play were noted by Forsyth County Sheriff’s Detectives or in the Forsyth County Coroner’s Office or GBI Medical Examiner’s reports. During the course of this investigation, Detectives have conducted approximately 30 interviews, and spent well over 300-man hours conducting this investigation. With a finding of an accidental death resulting from a fall as recorded by the GBI Medical Examiner’s Office, along with the extensive findings from the investigation of the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office, the Forsyth County Sheriff’s office has closed this death investigation.The PictureNearly all versions of the heavily shared posts about Horsford’s death were accompanied by the “adult sleepover party” image seen above. That photograph was part of the initial reporting by Atlanta-area outlet WGCL-TV on February 20 2019:On November 3, 2018 the 40-year-old mother of five was found dead in the backyard of a friend’s house. According to investigators, [Tamla] Horsford and other female friends were attending an adult slumber party.Jeanne Meyers, who resides at the residence, told police that Horsford was seen drinking from a blue bottle of tequila and smoking marijuana the previous night. She seemed in good spirits.As the party wound down around 1:30 a.m. Meyers says her friend opted to stay out on the deck to finish a cigarette. It was the last time she was seen alive. The next morning around 7:30 a.m. Horsford’s body was found.Autopsy results show Horsford sustained a laceration and fracture to her right wrist. Her cause of death is listed as “multiple blunt force injuries with other contributing factors being acute ethanol intoxication.”It was unclear how the photograph came to be in public circulation, but it appeared to be accurately described — it showed Horsford, a black woman, sitting amidst seven white women hours before she died under contested circumstances. Some iterations are credited to the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office, suggesting they released the image at some point after Horsford’s death.In a February 22 2019 post by Forsyth County News, Horsford’s husband Leander Horsford and other relatives expressed skepticism around the investigation into her death. Her husband said that the stories from others present at the party did not seem to add up:“I want the truth of what’s going on, because I mean, the stories I’ve heard so far, none of them make sense,” said Horsford’s husband, Leander Horsford. “And if they don’t make sense, usually there’s a reason they don’t make sense.”During their interview, Horsford and Terry Blanco, sister-in-law to Tamla Horsford, asked Christian why Horsford’s shoes and cigarette butts weren’t collected and tested, asserting that evidence could have been overlooked.“Even when she’s had the most she could have, she’s never ever fallen down,” Blanco stated. “We all know Tami and none of this makes sense.”Horsford and Blanco also told detectives that the family has ordered a second autopsy done privately out of state, because they, “don’t trust” the system in Forsyth County.“In my personal opinion I think that the investigation has been mishandled,” Horsford said. “That’s just my personal opinion because there’s a lot of things that were left back, that should not have been left back.”Developments in June 2020On June 12 2020, after several viral social media posts appeared, WSB-TV reporter Mike Petchenik tweeted a letter from the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) requesting that a new investigation be opened into Horsford’s death:BREAKING:  ⁦@ForsythCountySO⁩ officially asking the ⁦@GBI_GA⁩ to open a new investigation into the death of #TamlaHorsford. pic.twitter.com/sx1SIwWF1B— Mike Petchenik (@MPetchenikWSB) June 12, 2020Six days earlier, Petchenik tweeted an earlier statement from the Forsyth County Sheriff’s office about their initial investigation in late 2018 and early 2019:Statement from the @ForsythCountySO about the letter. pic.twitter.com/KHjdLbhOeu— Mike Petchenik (@MPetchenikWSB) June 6, 2020On June 10 2020, Petchenik reported that a petition calling for the case to be reopened had more than 50,000 signatures. A June 5 2020 letter from lawyer Ralph Fernandez to Leander Horsford about his review of the evidence was also shared by Petchenik on Twitter:THREAD:  Letter attached. pic.twitter.com/wnjdUmjWR1— Mike Petchenik (@MPetchenikWSB) June 6, 2020That letter read in part:The review reflects that a homicide is a strong possibility. Witness statements are in conflict. A potential subject handled the body as well as the evidence prior to the law enforcement arrival. Evidence was disposed of and no inquiry followed.The scene was not preserved. Evidence was improperly handled. The investigation was compromised by unauthorized access and disclosure to potential targets and witnesses. A remarkable fact is that there were no photographs taken during the autopsy of Tamla’s body. This had to have been done at someone’s directive because such a practice is unheard of.Let us address one issue as a sample, in reverse order, from the above. It appears Tamla was involved in a struggle. There were abrasions consistent with that scenario. There were parallel scratches to one arm. Since they were fresh, photos would not have proven recent use of defensive force. But having no photos inures to our detriment. There was one X-Ray, yet the injury noted as the cause of death appears nowhere. Getting the records has been another monumental task to say the least. I could go on, and will, in a few days. Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office employees have been the subject of much criticism. The case agent was a close friend of the subject, who turned out to be the leak of the ongoing investigation. The town of Cumming has a history which raises eyebrows. After conducting my extensive review I have come to the conclusion that the truth never had a chance here.A June 8 2020 tweet from Petchenik featured a Georgia Bureau of Investigation statement suggesting that photographs had been taken during Horsford’s autopsy. It is not clear which assertion is correct, or why Fernandez might have been unable to access the photographs:JUST IN:  Statement from @GBI_GA about Horsford’s autopsy. pic.twitter.com/1KihAJU03Z— Mike Petchenik (@MPetchenikWSB) June 8, 2020A separate June 12 2020 report by WSB-TV mentioned that “Petchenik reached out to the attorney representing the party-goers in a civil defamation case against one of Horsford’s best friend to see if he had any comment but has not heard back.” No additional information about the civil defamation case or parties involved appeared in that report.However, a statement attributed to lawyers for the other people at the party appeared to have been issued on February 20 2019 (based on its repeated mention of the passage of “109 days” between the document and Horsford’s death) accused “certain very vocal individuals” of trying to turn a “tragic death” into something else:109 days of waiting for the certain result that was to come yesterday in the press conference by the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Department. 109 days of our clients being unable to properly grieve the death of their friend, because of what certain very vocal individuals called a “murder” from the start. As stated previously, each person who was present on November 4, 2018, has cooperated completely with law enforcement officers in an attempt to give family and friends answers in regard to the tragic death of Tamla Horsford. […]As reported by the Sheriff [in February 2019] in his press conference, each of these three independent bodies found absolutely and unequivocally that there was no foul play and that there was no evidence of any assault. Our clients knew this to be fact because there was NEVER any wrongdoing by them that evening. Contrary to stories being put out there by a certain very vocal individual, this was not a racially motivated murder. This was not murder. This was not anything other than a tragic accident. Mrs. Horsford fell 18 feet from the top of the rail on the back deck to the ground.SummaryOn the morning of November 4 2018, Tamla Horsford was found dead in a backyard after attending an “adult sleepover” with seven white women.

584,2846,Overweight Americans who pick diet drinks eat more food: study.,"January 16, 2014","Heavy Americans who drink diet beverages rather than those sweetened with sugar appear to eat more, according to a study released on Thursday that raised questions about the role lower-calorie drinks play in helping people lose weight.",Susan Heavey,"Researchers at Johns Hopkins University analyzed data from a U.S. survey of 24,000 people over a period of 10 years. People who were overweight or obese generally consumed the same amount of calories a day no matter what they drank, but those who chose diet drinks got more of those calories from food. Outside experts were quick to caution that it is not clear what role, if any, diet drinks such as low- or no-calorie versions of sodas, sports drinks and teas played for people who ate more. In the study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, overweight drinkers of diet beverages in the United States ate 1,965 in food calories a day compared to 1,874 calories among heavy people who drank regular sugar-sweetened beverages. Among obese diet beverage drinkers, those who consumed low- or no-calorie drinks ate 2,058 calories a day in food versus 1,897 food calories for those who had regular drinks, researchers said. Such differences were statistically significant, they added. Lead author Sara Bleich said the results, when paired with other research, suggest that artificial sweeteners may affect people’s metabolism or cravings, although more study is needed. She acknowledged that people could be deciding to eat more since they are saving calories with their diet drinks. “The push to diet soda may not make a lot of sense if you are then also eating more solid food,” Bleich said. “The switch from a sugary beverage to a diet beverage should be coupled with other changes in the diet, particularly reducing snacks.”  Critics said the analysis, based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination survey between 1999 and 2010, is flawed and that it is too early to say what, if any, role the low-calorie drinks or their artificial sweeteners play in weight loss. Several researchers noted that the study did not track a set group of people over time and only looked at a 24-hour snapshot of what any individual consumed. The beverage industry, which has long promoted diet drinks as an alternative to full-calorie beverages, defended such alternatives to help manage weight. “Losing or maintaining weight comes down to balancing the total calories consumed with those burned through physical activity,” the American Beverage Association said in a statement on Thursday. Low- or no-calories drinks contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and sucralose. Many beverage companies are also turning to other alternatives, such as the extract of Stevia. Kelly Brownell, a professor psychology and neuroscience at Duke University and dean of its Sanford School of Public Policy, said while the study was compelling and there are still many questions about such sweeteners, more data is needed. “People need to separate the biology from the psychology,” he said. Bonnie Liebman, the director of nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said while her group may have other questions about artificial sweeteners, “it’s premature to conclude that it’s something going on in your brain.”  In the meantime there are other ways to watch your weight, she said: “You’re much better off with water - or coffee or tea, if they’re unsweetened.”",true,Health News
588,2164,Indonesia hunts for survivors as volcano tsunami toll nears 400.,"December 24, 2018","Indonesian military and rescue teams fanned out across a stretch of coastline on Monday, hoping to find survivors of a tsunami triggered by a landslide from a volcano that killed at least 373 people.",Fergus Jensen,"Thick clouds of ash spewed from Anak Krakatau, a volcanic island where a crater collapse at high tide late on Saturday set off waves that smashed into coastal areas on both sides of the Sunda Strait between the islands of Sumatra and Java. Rescuers used heavy machinery and bare hands to dig bodies out of mud and wreckage along a 100 km (60 mile) stretch of Java’s west coast. More than 1,400 people were injured, and about 12,000 residents had to move to higher ground, with a high-tide warning extended to Wednesday. The vast archipelago, which sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, has suffered its worst annual death toll from disasters in more than a decade. Earthquakes flattened parts of the island of Lombok in July and August, and a double quake-and-tsunami killed more than 2,000 people on a remote part of Sulawesi island in September. “At least 373 people have died, while 128 people are currently missing,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, said on Monday evening. (For graphic on Indonesia tsunami disaster zone, click tmsnrt.rs/2RdjsMd)  Saturday’s tsunami destroyed more than 700 buildings, from small shops and houses to villas and hotels. It took just 24 minutes after the landslide for waves to hit land, and there was no early warning for those living on the coast. Vehicles were crushed by waves that lifted chunks of metal, felled trees, wooden beams and household items and deposited them on roads and rice fields. Nurjana, 20, ran uphill after the tsunami hit. Her beachside snack stall was washed away. “I opened the door straight away and saved myself. I jumped over the wall,” she said. “Everything is destroyed.”  Out in the strait, Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was still erupting on Sunday night, belching white smoke and ash into the sky. The meteorology agency that an area of about 64 hectares, or 90 soccer pitches, of the volcanic island had collapsed into the sea. In 1883, the volcano then known as Krakatoa erupted in one of the biggest blasts in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunami, and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with its ash. Anak Krakatau is the island that emerged from the area in 1927, and has been growing ever since. The high waves isolated hundreds of people on Sebesi island, about 12 km from the volcano. “We are completely paralyzed,” Syamsiar, a village secretary on the island, told Metro TV, calling for food and medicine. President Joko Widodo, who is running for re-election in April, told disaster agencies to install early warning systems, but experts said that, unlike with tsunami caused by earthquakes, little could have been done to alert people that waves were coming. “Tsunamis from volcanic flank collapse are generated right at the coast and often close to populations,” said Eddie Dempsey, lecturer in structural geology at Britain’s University of Hull. “The interval between the volcanic collapse and the arrival of the waves is minimal.”  The timing of the disaster over the Christmas season evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Families streamed out of the area on Monday for fear of further tsunami, jamming roads already blocked by debris. Fishermen told how a light breeze was followed by a huge wave that smashed together wooden fishing boats moored off the coast and pulled down the trees they were tied to. Excavators were being used to move debris including piles of steel roofing tangled like spaghetti. Medics were sent in with the military, while groups of police and soldiers reached remote areas. One team used sniffer dogs to search for survivors at the beach club where a tsunami washed away an outdoor stage where the Indonesian rock band Seventeen were performing at a party for about 200 guests. They had already pulled out nine bodies that day. At a village 20 km away, district chief Atmadja Suhara said he was helping to care for 4,000 refugees, many of them now homeless. “Everybody is still in a state of panic,” he said. “We often have disasters, but not as bad as this.”  “God willing,” he said, “we will rebuild.”",true,Environment
589,32705,"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton both seek an abortion ""cutoff date"" of 36 weeks, and both claim that late-stage fetuses feel no pain and have no rights.","May 13, 2016","What's true: Both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton support abortion access with few restrictions, and Clinton indicated she would agree with late-term abortion bans if provisions were included for the health of the mother. What's false: Clinton and Sanders didn't expressly seek to legalize all elective abortions up to 36 weeks, and neither candidate said that fetuses didn't feel pain or have rights.",Kim LaCapria,"On 6 May 2016, a Facebook user published a status update, which was shared thousands of times, claiming that presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders had specific and identical plans for abortions in the United States:  The post included a photograph of a newborn baby ostensibly born several weeks early and encouraged fellow social media users to “share this post” and “get the word out.” This post employed the hashtag #Boycott36, although that tag did not appear to be part of any existing movement or initiative beforehand. A previous Facebook status update was nearly identical in substance, but that earlier post mentioned neither Clinton nor Sanders, saying only that the poster had “read” that undefined “people” want to increase the limit for abortions to 36 weeks:   Both versions were vague and misleading. We contacted a clinic that provides late-term abortions to ask about the circumstances under which such a procedure would be performed, and they told us that terminations in the 36th week of pregnancy typically occur due to a fetal incompatibility with life (that is, the fetus would not survive to term) that was somehow not diagnosed until late into the pregnancy. A May 2016 fact sheet published by Guttmacher did not include specific numbers about late-term abortions, but a chart indicated that only 1.3 percent of all abortions occurred after the 21-week mark:  In 2010, 2011, and 2012 (the most recent years for which statistics were available), the Centers for Disease Control recorded 765,651 abortions, 730,322 abortions, and 699,202 abortions respectively. A three-year average of those numbers was 731,725. 1.3 percent of that average worked out to roughly 9,512 abortions at or after the 21-week mark per year. According to Guttmacher, 43 states expressly prohibit abortion either after the fetus was viable or at a specific numerical point in the pregnancy [PDF]. The “#Boycott36” claim did not mention the fact that abortions were already illegal at or past the 20-week point in all but seven states and the District of Columbia. Both Sanders and Clinton list their positions on the issues on their campaign web sites. Clinton’s position can be found on the “Women’s rights and opportunity” section of her site, and it does not mention raising gestational age limits for abortion: Women’s personal health decisions should be made by a woman, her family, and her faith, with the counsel of her doctor. Hillary will stand up to Republican attempts to defund Planned Parenthood, which would restrict access to critical health care services, like cancer screenings, contraception, and safe, legal abortion. Sanders’ position is more detailed, but again does not mention raising gestational age limits in any way: Bernie believes in protecting a woman’s right to choose and has a lifetime pro-choice record. In 1993, he co-sponsored the Freedom of Choice Act, which aimed to bar states from restricting the right to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability or at any time when a termination is necessary to protect the health of a woman. In an op-ed for the Huffington Post published in April 2012, Bernie wrote “We are not returning to the days of back-room abortions, when countless women died or were maimed. The decision about abortion must remain a decision for the woman, her family and physician to make, not the government.” During his 16 years in the House of Representatives and 8 years in the Senate, Bernie has consistently supported a woman’s right to choose a safe abortion. In addition to co-sponsoring the 1993 Freedom of Choice Act, Bernie voted numerous times to allow women to travel interstate for abortions, supported permitting federal funding of organizations that conduct abortions, voted to increase access and funding for family planning for women, and co-sponsored the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2013, which prohibited many limitations on abortions. In March 2008, Bernie voted against defining an unborn child as eligible for State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and in turn defining life as beginning at conception. In light of these votes, Bernie has repeatedly received ratings of 100 percent from NARAL Pro-Choice America, and ratings of 0 percent from the National Right to Life Committee, indicating a pro-choice stance. Both Sanders and Clinton spoke about their positions on the topic of abortion during a March 2016 “Town Hall” appearance on Fox News. Sanders said he supports fewer restrictions than Clinton: While both candidates — like most Democrats — are both well known as in favor of abortion rights, they gave slightly different answers on the question of late-term abortions. Asked generally whether abortion should ever be illegal, Sen. Bernie Sanders said, “I happen to believe that it is wrong for the government to be telling a woman what to be doing with her own body.” He chided Republicans who broadly oppose government interference in people’s personal lives, “but somehow on this issue they want to tell every woman in America what she should do with her body.” Asked more specifically if he would support restrictions on abortions for pregnancies farther along than five months, Sanders simply responded, “I am very strongly pro-choice. That is a choice to be made between a woman, her physician and her family.” Clinton, by contrast, noted that she has gone on the record as in favor of some “late-pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother.” However, Clinton stressed that she objects to the recent efforts in Congress to pass a federal law banning abortions after 20 weeks with no exceptions. “Under Roe v. Wade, it is appropriate to say in these circumstances” that abortion rights may be restricted, she said — “so long as there’s an exception for the life and health of the mother.” Neither Sanders nor Clinton have expressly argued for “36-week abortions,” nor is that policy embraced or argued for by most pro-choice groups. Only 1.3 percent of abortions occur at or after the 21-week mark, and only seven states allow late-term abortions. We were also unable to locate any statements from either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders maintaining that late-term fetuses felt no pain or had any rights. The “36 week abortion” (or #Boycott36) rumor was one of several inaccurate claims about abortion to circulate on social media during the 2016 elections. In November 2015, claims about a scientifically discredited “abortion reversal” procedure circulated, and two separate rumors misleadingly claimed support was growing for “post-birth abortions.” In April 2016, another rumor made rounds regarding an abortion doctor purportedly strangling a baby born alive, a claim that was actually based on an incident that was nearly four decades old.",false,"Politics Politicians, 36 week abortion, abortion, bernie sanders"
591,8106,"Top Nigerian president aide, state governor test positive for coronavirus.","March 24, 2020","The Nigerian president’s influential chief of staff has tested positive for coronavirus, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.","Paul Carsten, Alexis Akwagyiram","Abba Kyari, who is in his 70s, is an important figure in President Muhammadu Buhari’s government and his illness could have ramifications for the running of the country. His case was one of a growing number in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, with a state governor also testing positive and the Lagos state health commissioner warning that they were beginning to see the virus “spread in the community”. Previously, most cases were travellers who had recently returned from the United Kingdom or the United States. Kyari has a history of medical complications, including diabetes, and is the gatekeeper to the president. Many who wish to deal with Buhari must go through Kyari, including Nigeria’s top politicians and business owners. Matthew Page, an associate fellow with the Africa Programme at Chatham House, described Kyari as the “lynchpin” of the Buhari government. “This has the potential to further slow down decision-making within top tiers of Nigerian government,” he said. Kyari travelled to Germany in early March with a delegation of other Nigerian officials for meetings with engineering and industrial giant Siemens AG. It is unclear if Kyari, who three diplomats also said had tested positive for coronavirus, self-isolated upon his return to Nigeria. Germany has reported some 27,000 cases of coronavirus and 114 deaths from the pandemic. A presidency spokesman did not comment on Kyari’s condition and whether Buhari has been tested. The president, 77, has undisclosed medical ailments and spent five months in London for treatment in 2017. Later on Tuesday, a Bauchi state government spokesman said Governor Bala Mohammed had also been diagnosed with coronavirus and was in quarantine. As of Tuesday, Nigeria had 42 confirmed cases of coronavirus, two of whom had recovered, and one death - a 67-year-old former oil official. It was unclear if Kyari or Mohammed’s diagnoses were included in that total. The number of journalists allowed access to the presidential office complex will be cut indefinitely from more than 100 to 13 starting Wednesday, the presidency said late on Tuesday with all foreign media barred. And parliament was adjourned for two weeks. The Nigeria Stock Exchange said its trading floors would close temporarily, only allowing remote trading. Lagos state Commissioner for Health Professor Akin Abayomi warned that hundreds of Africa’s top film stars could have been exposed to coronavirus at the African Magic Viewers’ Choice Award on March 14. Lagos state governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu announced that all parks, gyms and public markets in the commercial capital, apart from those selling food, water, medicine or “other essential life-saving products”, would close on Thursday for at least seven days. He stopped short, however, of calling for a total lockdown, citing the many among Lagos’s 20 million residents who could not afford to stock up on essential items. “We know what our poverty line is, and I’m a very realistic leader,” he said. “We need to be considerate of that.”",true,Health News
593,31717,An adopted dog's former owner turned out to be a soldier who was killed in Iraq.,"August 8, 2009","However, that the story may not be literal truth doesn’t prevent it from being figurative truth. Those who serve overseas do so at the cost of great personal sacrifice. A tale such as this — literal truth or not — serves to remind us all of how much they give and how much we owe them.",David Mikkelson,"Those who serve with the U.S. armed forces often face difficult choices when they receive orders deploying them overseas. Not only do they have to be prepared to be parted from their loved ones and make arrangements regarding the storage of personal possessions, but they may also face the problem of finding proper caretakers for their pets — not all of those serving in the military have people they can leave their beloved animal companions with. Some locate appropriate foster families that will care for their pets until their return, some give up their critters for adoption at shelters, and some may even (as a last resort) turn them loose to fend for themselves. (There are services that will assist those departing for overseas duty with the process of finding good temporary homes for their pets, such as “Dogs on Deployment” and “Guardian Angels for Soldier’s Pet.” If you’re looking for a way to help those who are serving their country outside the U.S. and have room in your life for an extra cat or dog for the duration of someone’s tour of duty, do consider opening your home to a military pet.) One such tale about a military pet began hitting our inbox in August 2009, with our earliest online sighting of it dating to an August 2008 message board post:  They told me the big black Lab’s name was Reggie as I looked at him lying in his pen. the shelter was clean, no-kill, and the people really friendly. I’d only been in the area for six months, but everywhere I went in the small college town, people were welcoming and open. Everyone waves when you pass them on the street. But something was still missing as I attempted to settle in to my new life here, and I thought a dog couldn’t hurt. Give me someone to talk to. And I had just seen Reggie’s advertisement on the local news. The shelter said they had received numerous calls right after, but they said the people who had come down to see him just didn’t look like “Lab people,” whatever that meant. They must’ve thought I did. But at first, I thought the shelter had misjudged me in giving me Reggie and his things, which consisted of a dog pad, bag of toys almost all of which were brand new tennis balls, his dishes, and a sealed letter from his previous owner. See, Reggie and I didn’t really hit it off when we got home. We struggled for two weeks (which is how long the shelter told me to give him to adjust to his new home). Maybe it was the fact that I was trying to adjust, too. Maybe we were too much alike. For some reason, his stuff (except for the tennis balls — he wouldn’t go anywhere without two stuffed in his mouth) got tossed in with all of my other unpacked boxes. I guess I didn’t really think he’d need all his old stuff, that I’d get him new things once he settled in. but it became pretty clear pretty soon that he wasn’t going to. I tried the normal commands the shelter told me he knew, ones like “sit” and “stay” and “come” and “heel,” and he’d follow them — when he felt like it. He never really seemed to listen when I called his name — sure, he’d look in my direction after the fourth or fifth time I said it, but then he’d just go back to doing whatever. When I’d ask again, you could almost see him sigh and then grudgingly obey. This just wasn’t going to work. He chewed a couple shoes and some unpacked boxes. I was a little too stern with him and he resented it, I could tell. The friction got so bad that I couldn’t wait for the two weeks to be up, and when it was, I was in full-on search mode for my cellphone amid all of my unpacked stuff. I remembered leaving it on the stack of boxes for the guest room, but I also mumbled, rather cynically, that the “darn dog probably hid it on me.” Finally I found it, but before I could punch up the shelter’s number, I also found his pad and other toys from the shelter. I tossed the pad in Reggie’s direction and he snuffed it and wagged, some of the most enthusiasm I’d seen since bringing him home. But then I called, “Hey, Reggie, you like that? Come here and I’ll give you a treat.” Instead, he sort of glanced in my direction — maybe “glared” is more accurate — and then gave a discontented sigh and flopped down. With his back to me. Well, that’s not going to do it either, I thought. And I punched the shelter phone number. But I hung up when I saw the sealed envelope. I had completely forgotten about that, too. “Okay, Reggie,” I said out loud, “let’s see if your previous owner has any advice.” To Whoever Gets My Dog: Well, I can’t say that I’m happy you’re reading this, a letter I told the shelter could only be opened by Reggie’s new owner. I’m not even happy writing it. If you’re reading this, it means I just got back from my last car ride with my Lab after dropping him off at the shelter. He knew something was different. I have packed up his pad and toys before and set them by the back door before a trip, but this time … it’s like he knew something was wrong. And something is wrong … which is why I have to go to try to make it right. So let me tell you about my Lab in the hopes that it will help you bond with him and he with you. First, he loves tennis balls. the more the merrier. Sometimes I think he’s part squirrel, the way he hoardes them. He usually always has two in his mouth, and he tries to get a third in there. Hasn’t done it yet. Doesn’t matter where you throw them, he’ll bound after it, so be careful — really don’t do it by any roads. I made that mistake once, and it almost cost him dearly. Next, commands. Maybe the shelter staff already told you, but I’ll go over them again: Reggie knows the obvious ones — “sit,” “stay,” “come,” “heel.” He knows hand signals: “back” to turn around and go back when you put your hand straight up; and “over” if you put your hand out right or left. “Shake” for shaking water off, and “paw” for a high-five. He does “down” when he feels like lying down — I bet you could work on that with him some more. He knows “ball” and “food” and “bone” and “treat” like nobody’s business. I trained Reggie with small food treats. Nothing opens his ears like little pieces of hot dog. Feeding schedule: twice a day, once about seven in the morning, and again at six in the evening. Regular store-bought stuff; the shelter has the brand. He’s up on his shots. Call the clinic on 9th Street and update his info with yours; they’ll make sure to send you reminders for when he’s due. Be forewarned: Reggie hates the vet. Good luck getting him in the car — I don’t know how he knows when it’s time to go to the vet, but he knows. Finally, give him some time. I’ve never been married, so it’s only been Reggie and me for his whole life. He’s gone everywhere with me, so please include him on your daily car rides if you can. He sits well in the backseat, and he doesn’t bark or complain. He just loves to be around people, and me most especially. Which means that this transition is going to be hard, with him going to live with someone new. And that’s why I need to share one more bit of info with you … His name’s not Reggie. I don’t know what made me do it, but when I dropped him off at the shelter, I told them his name was Reggie. He’s a smart dog, he’ll get used to it and will respond to it, of that I have no doubt. but I just couldn’t bear to give them his real name. For me to do that, it seemed so final, that handing him over to the shelter was as good as me admitting that I’d never see him again. And if I end up coming back, getting him, and tearing up this letter, it means everything’s fine. But if someone else is reading it, well… well it means that his new owner should know his real name. It’ll help you bond with him. Who knows, maybe you’ll even notice a change in his demeanor if he’s been giving you problems. His real name is Tank. Because that is what I drive. Again, if you’re reading this and you’re from the area, maybe my name has been on the news. I told the shelter that they couldn’t make “Reggie” available for adoption until they received word from my company commander. See, my parents are gone, I have no siblings, no one I could’ve left Tank with … and it was my only real request of the Army upon my deployment to Iraq, that they make one phone call to the shelter … in the “event”… to tell them that Tank could be put up for adoption. Luckily, my colonel is a dog guy, too, and he knew where my platoon was headed. He said he’d do it personally. And if you’re reading this, then he made good on his word. Well, this letter is getting to downright depressing, even though, frankly, I’m just writing it for my dog. I couldn’t imagine if I was writing it for a wife and kids and family. but still, Tank has been my family for the last six years, almost as long as the Army has been my family. And now I hope and pray that you make him part of your family and that he will adjust and come to love you the same way he loved me. That unconditional love from a dog is what I took with me to Iraq as an inspiration to do something selfless, to protect innocent people from those who would do terrible things … and to keep those terrible people from coming over here. If I had to give up Tank in order to do it, I am glad to have done so. He was my example of service and of love. I hope I honored him by my service to my country and comrades. All right, that’s enough. I deploy this evening and have to drop this letter off at the shelter. I don’t think I’ll say another good-bye to Tank, though. I cried too much the first time. Maybe I’ll peek in on him and see if he finally got that third tennis ball in his mouth. Good luck with Tank. Give him a good home, and give him an extra kiss goodnight — every night — from me. Thank you, Paul Mallory I folded the letter and slipped it back in the envelope. Sure I had heard of Paul Mallory, everyone in town knew him, even new people like me. Local kid, killed in Iraq a few months ago and posthumously earning the Silver Star when he gave his life to save three buddies. Flags had been at half-mast all summer. I leaned forward in my chair and rested my elbows on my knees, staring at the dog. “Hey, Tank,” I said quietly. The dog’s head whipped up, his ears cocked and his eyes bright. C’mere boy.” He was instantly on his feet, his nails clicking on the hardwood floor. He sat in front of me, his head tilted, searching for the name he hadn’t heard in months. “Tank,” I whispered. His tail swished. I kept whispering his name, over and over, and each time, his ears lowered, his eyes softened, and his posture relaxed as a wave of contentment just seemed to flood him. I stroked his ears, rubbed his shoulders, buried my face into his scruff and hugged him. “It’s me now, Tank, just you and me. Your old pal gave you to me.” Tank reached up and licked my cheek. “So whatdaya say we play some ball? His ears perked again. “Yeah? Ball? You like that? Ball?” Tank tore from my hands and disappeared in the next room. And when he came back, he had three tennis balls in his mouth. As to the core question of whether it’s a true story, accepting it as literally true requires the reader to believe in a chain of improbable circumstances: that a no-kill shelter would agree to serve indefinitely as an unpaid kennel service, that a dog owner would turn over his pet to the long-term (and possibly permanent) care of others without telling anyone its real name, and that a dog’s adoptive owner would accept a “sealed letter from his previous owner” and simply toss it aside without bothering to open or read it. This string of contrivances smacks more of a fictional plot device than a literal account of a real-life occurrence. Moreover, none of the verifiable details checks out as given in the narrative. Many different web sites record and honor the names of all U.S. service personnel killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we could find no one by the name of Paul Mallory listed among the casualties on any of them (including the Iraq Coalition Casualty Count’s iCasualties.org and the Washington Post’s Faces of the Fallen), nor could we turn up any confirmatory news account of the death of a U.S. serviceman named Paul Mallory. Even if we proceed on the assumption that “Paul Mallory” is a pseudonym, the details still don’t check out. The narrative describes Reggie’s original owner as having posthumously received the Silver Star after being killed in Iraq, as having never been married, and as having no living parents, siblings, or other relatives with whom he could have left his dog while he was deployed overseas. We meticulously checked the Silver Star database at the HomeofHeroes.com web site and located obituaries for every single U.S. service member (from all branches) who was listed there as having posthumously received that award in connection with his service in Iraq, and every single such recipient was described in his obituary as having left behind some combination of parents, siblings, wives, and children — not one of those fallen heroes was unmarried with no living parents or siblings.",false,Glurge Gallery
595,2686,Many U.S. kids have chronic health problems: study.,"February 16, 2010","More than a quarter of American children have a chronic health condition such as obesity or asthma, but many children overcome these problems with time, U.S. researchers said on Tuesday.",Julie Steenhuysen,"They said the findings make clear that chronic health conditions are rising among children, and access to healthcare is essential to diagnose and treat them. “A lot of kids will have chronic conditions over the course of their childhood,” said Dr. Jeanne Van Cleave of Massachusetts General Hospital for Children in Boston, who worked on the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. “It is very important for children to have continuous access to high-quality healthcare, especially primary care, where a lot of these conditions are picked up and treated,” she said in a telephone interview. Van Cleave and colleagues used data from a government survey of three groups of children — each group with about 1,000 or more children — aged 2 through 8 between 1988 and 2006. They found the rate of chronic health conditions — obesity, asthma and learning problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD — doubled to 26.6 percent in 2006 from 12.8 percent in 1994. “The good news is, for about half of these kids, their conditions will go away over time,” Van Cleave said. They found that 16.6 percent of all the children surveyed had a chronic condition at the beginning of the study period, and 20.8 percent reported having a chronic condition at the end. But only 7.4 percent of the children had a chronic condition both at the beginning and at the end of the study period, and 9.3 percent of children reported having a chronic condition at the beginning of the study that was not present at the end. “It’s a very hopeful finding. It offers a lot of opportunity for prevention and for finding out more about why certain chronic conditions resolve, and why others don’t, and why the same chronic condition in one child will resolve and why it doesn’t in another child,” Van Cleave said. The trick, she said, is finding out why conditions go away so that more children may be helped. She said future studies need to look at what factors surround the kids who see improvements compared with the ones who do not. “Our study didn’t specifically look at for which children the chronic condition of obesity was less likely to resolve. That would be a very important piece of information we could use in actual medical care,” Van Cleave said. Dr. Geetha Raghuveer of Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, who was not involved with the study, said that while it was heartening that chronic conditions went away in several children, it was worrying that such a large percentage of children had a chronic health problem at some point. She said these problems “will need prevention strategies geared toward larger environments such as families, schools, communities,” and laws that make nutritious foods more accessible and affordable.",true,Health News
596,34106,The high-dose Fluzone vaccine caused the deaths of 23 senior citizens during a clinical trial.,"November 1, 2019","Because no evidence is provided for the claim that these 23 deaths were linked in any way to the trial in either Health Impact News’ reporting, the raw clinical trial data, or the published report based on that trial, we rank the assertion as “False.”",Alex Kasprak,"It may not shock anyone to hear that among a group of 3,000-plus Americans no younger than 65 and with an average age of 73, 23 of them passed away during a six-month period. It wouldn’t shock actuaries, who know that the average life expectancy in the United States is 78.6 years. It wouldn’t shock statisticians, who know that the U.S. death rate among 75- to 84-year-olds is 4,472.6 deaths per 100,000 people a year, which would equate to over 100 deaths per 3,000 people annually. Nonetheless, it appears to have shocked the editors at the anti-vaccine website Health Impact News. In 2013, that outlet published a story with the misleading headline “23 Seniors Died After Receiving Flu Shot Sold by Pharmacies.” Snopes continues to get worried inquiries about the claim every flu season. Health Impact News’ story came from the publicly available insert that comes with a specific flu shot marketed as “Fluzone High-Dose,” which discussed the results of scientific testing that went into approving the vaccine for use in 2009: Within 6 months post-vaccination, 156 (6.1%) Fluzone High-Dose recipients and 93 (7.4%)  Fluzone recipients experienced a serious adverse event. No deaths were reported within 28 days post-vaccination. A total of 23 deaths were reported during the period Day 29–180 post-vaccination: (0.6%) among Fluzone High-Dose recipients and 7 (0.6%) among Fluzone 1 recipients. The majority of these participants had a medical history of cardiac, hepatic, neoplastic, renal, and/or respiratory diseases. No deaths were considered to be caused by vaccination. Fluzone High-Dose, as the name implies, contains more antigens than the regular inactivated influenza virus, thereby creating more antibodies capable of defending the body against influenza. The necessity for such a drug stems from the fact that seniors require more antibodies than younger individuals to fight the flu, and because they die from it at higher rates. The results in the drug insert discussed by Health Impact News stem from a Phase Three clinical trial that occurred between 2006 and 2007 and whose results led to approval of the drug. Health Impact News, based on the vaccine insert, makes three poorly formulated assertions under the guise of “just asking questions.” Most of the answers to these questions could have been found by analyzing the publicly available raw data from the clinical trial or by reading the study that was published as a result of that trial: As a general rule, a temporal relationship between a vaccination and a death — especially when the considered period of time includes 180 days of follow-up — is not sufficient evidence that the vaccination caused that death. A death can be attributable to a vaccination if it appears to have been caused by an established and known scientific mechanism — these are summarized in a 2011 National Academies publication and are rooted in rigorous epidemiological data — or if an acute, adverse reaction, such as anaphylactic shock following administration, clearly causes the death. The fact that a senior with an average age of 73 died at some point between 29 and 150 days after receiving a flu shot is not evidence of death from a flu shot, nor does any reason exist that death from a flu shot should be the default assumption over that period of time. The Health Impact News claim that “the deaths [should] be equally spread out through all time periods” is confusing and betrays an ignorance of the underlying study. Follow-up monitoring of participants occurred over 180 days split into two periods of time. The first time period monitored by the researchers lasted 28 days. The second monitoring period lasted the following 152 days. No reasonable person would argue that a person has an equal chance of death — all other issues ignored — over a 28-day period versus a 152-day period. Though no data is presented about the health of the participants who died during the trial, Health Impact News again relies on the baseless assumption that people can die during a clinical trial in only two ways: from a condition one had prior to receiving a drug and from the drug itself being tested in the trial. In fact, a condition known as “old age” makes one more susceptible to a wide variety of illnesses that could conceivably develop over 180 days. What we do know is that the population of people in this clinical trial who received the high-dose flu shot and the people who received the regular dose of the flu shot were statistically identical from a pre-existing health condition perspective. Further, if the implication is that the flu shot caused the death of 23 people, one might reasonably infer that more deaths would be expected in the high-dose group compared to the low-dose group. This was not the case: 16 of the deaths came from the 2,573 individuals who received the high-dose vaccine, and seven came from the 1,260 who received the other vaccine. From a percentage basis, 0.6% of participants in both the high-dose and low-dose groups died during the 180-day monitoring period. Health Impact News spends several paragraphs convincing the reader that giving seniors a higher dose of a flu shot is inherently wrong while ignoring voluminous scientific evidence supporting the notion that the elderly need a higher dose, and that such a product could save countless lives. Ironically, they then present (without context) the results of a study that unequivocally demonstrates that a higher dose did not create any increase in long-term adverse effects but did increase the immunity of seniors. It is true that 23 people (out of 3,800) died during the 180-day period following vaccination, but this death rate is on par with the U.S. rate for that age group regardless of participation in a trial.",false,Medical

Fiorina’s claim makes it sound like there is actual footage of Planned Parenthood examining an aborted fetus whose heart is still beating, while someone says ""we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain."" There isn't. Fiorina is likely talking about this 10-minute Aug. 19 video. (Warning: The video contains extremely gruesome footage.) The video shows an interview with a woman talking about a scene similar to the one Fiorina describes; the video’s creators have matched her interview with grisly stock footage of a fetus outside the womb. In the video, the Center for Medical Progress interviews a woman identified as Holly O’Donnell, a former procurement technician for StemExpress. StemExpress is a biomedical company that previously worked with Planned Parenthood to collect tissue for medical research, but the company ended its relationship with Planned Parenthood amid the ongoing controversy. O’Donnell talks about a time when she saw a fully-formed aborted fetus, with its heart still beating, in a pathology lab at a California Planned Parenthood clinic while she was on a job. ""I’m sitting here looking at this fetus, and its heart is beating, and I don’t know what to think,"" O’Donnell said. According to O’Donnell, her supervisor then told her they would procure the brain because the fetus was well-preserved. The Center for Medical Progress video does not show actually show footage of O’Donnell’s experience, and there’s nothing else in the video to corroborate O’Donnell’s story. Additionally, the supervisor in O’Donnell’s story does not say anything about keeping the fetus alive specifically for the purpose of harvesting the brain. To dramatize O’Donnell’s interview, the video cuts to a fetus outside the womb, placed on what appears to be some sort of examination surface, and the fetus’ legs are moving. The Center for Medical Progress says the source of the footage is the Grantham Collection, an organization that hopes to stem abortion by promoting graphic images of the procedure. We don’t know the circumstances behind this video: where it came from, under what conditions it was obtained, or even if this fetus was actually aborted (as opposed to a premature birth or miscarriage).

601,7879,"UK to use firefighters to deliver food, collect bodies in coronavirus crisis.","March 27, 2020","The United Kingdom will use firefighters to help deliver food, retrieve dead bodies and drive ambulances as it braces for the looming peak of the coronavirus outbreak that has already claimed the lives of more than 22,000 people across the world.",Michael Holden,"Britain initially took a strikingly modest approach to the worst health crisis since the 1918 influenza epidemic but then changed tack to impose stringent controls after projections showed a quarter of a million British people could die. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered a virtual lockdown of the world’s fifth largest economy to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus banning Britons from leaving their homes for all non-essential reasons. So far, 578 people in the United Kingdom have died after testing positive for coronavirus and the number of confirmed cases has risen to 11,658. The UK toll is the seventh worst in the world, after Italy, Spain, China, Iran, France and the United States, according to a Reuters tally. Under a deal struck between the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), Fire chiefs and Fire and Rescue Employers, firefighters will continue to respond to their usual emergencies but will now also carry out new tasks. “We face a public health crisis unparalleled in our lifetimes. The coronavirus outbreak is now a humanitarian emergency and firefighters rightly want help their communities,” said Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary. “Many fear the loss of life in this outbreak could be overwhelming and firefighters, who often handle terrible situations and incidents, are ready to step in to assist with body retrieval.”  As well as collecting those who die should there be mass casualties, firefighters can drive ambulances, and take food and medicine to the vulnerable under the agreement. To cope with the outbreak, Britain has already asked tens of thousands of retired doctors and healthcare workers to return to work, while hundreds of thousands of people have volunteered to assist the state-run National Health Service. On Friday, the capital’s ambulance service appealed to  former paramedics and control room staff for help, and London’s police force asked officers who have retired in the last five years to come back. “It is important that we take all reasonable steps to bolster our numbers,” London Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said. Britons across the country took to their balconies and front doors on Thursday evening to applaud health workers and bang pots and pans to show support for those working for the nation’s much-loved NHS. There has been criticism that the government has not acted quickly enough to provide protective equipment to frontline healthcare staff and it is also scrambling to source thousands of ventilators to treat those with severe breathing problems caused by the virus. The government has admitted that it missed an opportunity to join a European Union procurement scheme to source the equipment because of an email mix up. “There was an issue in terms of communications so the tendering process on those schemes had already started,” Business Secretary Alok Sharma told BBC radio on Friday.",true,Health News

ZHDA represents junior and middle level doctors at public hospitals. “As health professionals we are being threatened by security elements. Both nurses and doctors are regularly being told that resisting what the government offers them will result in their death,” according to a doctors petition to parliament. “Evidence of the threats is available in audio and text messages,” the petition said without giving more details. Police said they could not immediately comment. Edric Nhema, secretary general for the country’s nurses union who was part of the salary negotiating team with Magombeyi, told doctors at Parirenyatwa Hospital before the march that he had received death threats from unknown people. State security minister Owen Ncube said in a statement that the government was treating Magombeyi’s case as a disappearance and not an abduction as alleged by the doctor’s colleagues. He said the timing of Magombeyi’s disappearance, ahead of the United Nations annual meeting next week and at a time a U.N. special rapporteur on human rights was in Zimbabwe, pointed to work by a “third force” meant to tarnish the country’s image. Dozens of riot police blocked more than 200 doctors on Wednesday as they marched to parliament to present their petition chanting “no Peter, no work”. Two years after President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the army conspired to oust longtime ruler Robert Mugabe, people are suffering from triple-digit inflation that has eroded salaries and shortages of basic goods like fuel and electricity. Human rights groups say they have recorded more than 20 cases of abductions of activists by state security agents since January. The government denies any involvement. Churches under the Zimbabwe Heads of Christian Denominations (ZHOCD) groups said they were worried that after many reported cases of abduction, no one had been arrested. “This has put the security of citizens at the highest level of vulnerability,” ZHOCD said in a statement, adding that Mnangagwa should publicly condemn abductions and torture of civilians.",true,health
607,2053,Americans sicker but English die quicker says study.,"November 4, 2010","Older Americans suffer more chronic disease than their English counterparts, but the English die earlier, according to a study on Thursday that could revive debate about whose health system is better.","Kate Kelland, Julie Steenhuysen","An elderly man in a electric wheelchair smokes a cigar as he rides through Hyde Park in London, May 19, 2010. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth Researchers at the U.S.-based RAND Corp and Britain’s Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that while Americans aged 55 and older have higher rates of chronic disease, they live longer than elderly people who get ill in England. “If you get sick at older ages, you will die sooner in England than in the United States,” said James Smith, an economist with RAND in Santa Monica, California, who co-authored the study with James Banks and Alastair Muriel of the IFS. “It appears that at least in terms of survival at older ages with chronic disease, the medical system in the United States may be better than the system in England.”   But that edge comes at a price. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data show the United States spends more on healthcare than any other nation, and Banks said spending on healthcare for the elderly in the U.S. is almost double that in England. In 2008, the latest year for which full OECD figures are available, the United States spent 16 percent of its national output or $7,538 per person on health — well over double the $3,000 per person average of all OECD countries. British politicians leapt to defend the state-funded National Health System when it was attacked during the 2009 U.S. presidential election campaign by Republicans who used criticism of the NHS — which they called a socialist system — to stoke opposition to Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms. Supporters of Obama’s reforms argue too many people fall through the net and are without medical insurance. Once people in the United States turn 65, however, they become eligible for Medicare, a government-run health insurance program for the elderly that gives nearly 40 million Americans access to high quality medical care. For the study, published in the journal Demography, researchers analyzed data from two surveys of people aged 50 and over — the U.S. Health and Retirement Survey, a nationally representative sample than includes over 20,000 people — and the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing, which contains data on around 12,000 respondents. They looked at rates of key chronic diseases — diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, heart attack, stroke, chronic lung diseases and cancer — and at death rates among those aged 55 to 64 and aged 70 to 80. They also looked at the onset of new illnesses in these groups from 2002 to 2006. For people in their 70s, diabetes rates were almost twice as high in the United States as in England, at 17.2 percent versus 10.4 percent, and cancer rates were more than double, at 17.9 percent in the U.S. and 7.8 percent in England. Death rates among those 55 to 64 were similar in the U.S. and Britain, showing that although the Americans had more disease they lived just as long. In the older age group the English death rates were higher, showing that even though these Americans had higher rates of disease, they lived longer. The researchers said the findings showed that among older people, the U.S. health problem is not in healthcare provision nor in insurance coverage but in excess rates of illness. “The differences (in disease rates) are striking ... and that’s got to be an important priority for policy in terms of lifestyle or behavioral factors,” Banks told Reuters in London. In a telephone interview, Smith said that while the U.S. health system does a poor job at preventing disease, it delivers more when people get ill and is better at keeping them alive. “The criticism has been that the American medical system must be awful, but if you get treated, you actually have a better probability of survival. We are getting something from all of these dollars we put into the medical system.”",true,Health News

Research suggests big drops in pedestrian-vehicle accidents when sidewalks are introduced. But Bike Austin didn’t offer nor did we find research showing the addition of bike lanes in themselves or bike lanes plus sidewalks resulted in any percentage plummet in crashes. Instead, the city analysis states that reconfiguring lanes on part of one road, which also gained bike lanes, preceded 38 percent fewer crashes--with crash reductions averaging 29 percent among five road-diet projects.",Jane Wester,"CLARIFICATION, 3:46 p.m., Sept. 9, 2016: Shortly after this fact check posted, we revised a sentence to say that we didn't find research tying the addition of simple bike lanes to specific percentage reductions in crashes. We'd originally said we didn't see research generally tying bike lanes to crash reductions. Our rating of the group's claim didn't change. After a 14-year-old bicyclist was hit by a car and killed in Austin in June 2016, local nonprofit Bike Austin called on the city to make streets safer for bicyclists and pedestrians. In a statement, the group’s executive director, Mercedes Feris, said: ""Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin’s streets."" Does that hold up? Group cites city report To our inquiry, Feris cited a 2015 City of Austin report, ""Redesigning the Street: A Report on Right-Sizing Projects in Austin, TX 1999-2014,"" analyzing the effects of a certain kind of project, called a road diet, designed to make streets safer by shrinking opportunities to drive too fast. In what the Federal Highway Administration calls the classic example of a road diet, lane lines on a four-lane road that has two lanes in each direction are repainted to create a three-lane road, leaving a single lane in each direction and a center lane solely for left turns. A 2014 agency guide to road diets says the concept developed decades ago in response to the expansion-minded road construction of the 1950s and 1960s, when two-lane roads were frequently upgraded to four lanes. One of the first road diets, the guide says, was applied in 1979 to a four-lane road in Billings, Montana. On that road, where about 10,000 cars drove every day, the shrinkage to three lanes was found to reduce crashes without increasing delays. We dug into Austin’s more recent report and checked with experts on road diets and bicycle transportation. From that, we found that such projects often incorporate new bike lanes -- but they don’t typically add sidewalks. Generally, too, the highway administration has found that crashes in which a car hits a pedestrian walking on the side of the road consistently fall by more than 50 percent when sidewalks are installed. We failed to identify research tying the addition of simple, striped bike lanes to specific percentage reductions in crashes. The cited city report covers 37 local road diets completed from 1999 through 2014, including the one that Feris pointed out, on a 1.6-mile stretch of Manor Road in Northeast Austin. It resulted, the report says, in a 38 percent drop in crashes. A city spokeswoman, Marissa Monroy, responded to our inquiry about the research, saying by email the 38 percent reduction in any kind of crash ties to nearly six years of data collected by the Austin Police Department before and after the road diet took place on the stretch of Manor Road between Theo Drive and East 51st Street in November 2010. A close-up aerial view from along the noted 1.6-mile segment of Manor Road after the road diet was completed. The road includes bike lanes and the hallmark of a road diet project: a center two-way left-turn lane. SOURCE: Google Earth. Monroy told us that in the three years before the project, from November 2007 through October 2010, the to-be-reconfigured section had 39 crashes involving any combination of motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians--adding up to one pedestrian death and 16 injury crashes involving motor vehicles. In the three years after the project, from December 2010 through November 2013, she said, the stretch had 24 crashes -- or 38.5 percent fewer -- with no fatalities and 14 injury crashes, one involving a pedestrian, two affecting bicyclists. It’s also worth mentioning, as the city report says, that bike traffic on the segment increased 180 percent, from 54 bikes tallied in a 24-hour period before the project (and its bike lanes) was completed with 151 bikes in a similar period after. The full report presents general crash-reduction analyses for five of the 37 projects. Among the five, it sums up, ""right-sizing projects,"" or road diets, contributed to at least 22 percent fewer crashes, on Amherst Drive, up to the nearly 39 percent reduction on the Manor Road stretch. We calculated the average of the five: 28.8 percent fewer crashes. Expert: Road diets reduce accidents For outside perspective, we reached out to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, hearing back about road diets, bike lanes and sidewalks from Joan Hudson, an associate research engineer. Hudson advised that the noted 38 percent reduction in crashes falls in line with national research she’s reviewed, also pointing us to the highway administration and the National Cooperative Highway Research Program -- a division of the Transportation Research Board, which is part of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Each agency highlights the same two studies finding ""the road-diet treatment had a significant effect"" in reducing crashes, as the cooperative research program said in a 2008 report. The reductions ranged from 19 to 47 percent, with an average of 29 percent. Hudson said road diets make roads safer for a few reasons: additional space improves reaction time, and a narrower roadway tends to reduce how fast drivers go, making crashes less severe. Road diets also make bicyclists more comfortable, she said, because they have dedicated space instead of sharing lanes with cars. The city’s report also reflected these points. Hudson confirmed that most road diets include bike lanes, but said sidewalks -- posing greater costs than what it takes to revise lane lines -- are hardly ever included. (It looks to us like a sidewalk may have been installed on the Manor Road stretch. To our query, Monroy said she couldn’t confirm it was part of the related road-diet project.) And by phone, Hudson told us that determining how much road diets reduce crashes involving bicyclists or pedestrians is hard because there’s not much data measuring bicycle and pedestrian traffic before and after roads are relined. It may be, for instance, she said, that bike accidents escalate after a project is completed largely because more bicyclists use the added bike lanes. That looks to us like what happened on the on the Manor Road stretch, where bike traffic more than doubled with bike crashes only slightly going up. Bike lanes alone? We wondered if perhaps bike lanes alone result in double-digit crash reductions. To our inquiry, a University of Wisconsin urban planning professor, Robert Schneider, said by email that ""it is difficult to make a specific statement"" about how a particular bike lane reduces crashes, because that’s not what researches examine. Schneider, who teaches about pedestrian and bike safety, said research tends to be broader, looking at what experts call ""networks"" -- routes through whole cities or significant parts of cities -- to determine how easy and safe it is to get around on a bike. Research examining those networks, Schneider said, shows that bike-friendly cities help drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians stay safe. He cited a 2011 study from two engineers at the University of Colorado-Denver finding that when intersections and roads are easier for cyclists to navigate and more cyclists hit the road, drivers tend to slow down and be more aware of their surroundings. A Bike Austin leader, Miller Nuttle, informed of our findings, said its claim wasn’t worded as precisely as it should have been. Our ruling Bike Austin said: ""Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin’s streets."" Research suggests big drops in pedestrian-vehicle accidents when sidewalks are introduced. But Bike Austin didn’t offer nor did we find research showing the addition of bike lanes in themselves or bike lanes plus sidewalks resulted in any percentage plummet in crashes.

609,25935,If you maintain social distancing indoors “there's no reason to have an additional mask on top of that.”,"July 20, 2020",Multiple scientists have encouraged people to wear masks in public in addition to other measures including hand washing and social distancing. The CDC recommends that people wear cloth masks in public especially when social distancing is hard to maintain.,Amy Sherman,"Florida state Rep. Anthony Sabatini brought his legal fight against local government mask mandates to cable news, saying the requirements violate ""facial autonomy"" and aren’t very effective. Sabatini, a Republican from Howey-in-the-Hills in Lake County, has filed at least eight lawsuits against local governments including Leon County, where a judge upheld the mask ordinance, and Hillsborough County. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has deferred to local officials and not issued a statewide order despite record-setting cases of the disease. CNN’s Brianna Keilar asked Sabatini if he wore a mask at the grocery store. ""Absolutely not,"" he replied. ""I've maintained social distance though."" Keilar pushed Sabatini to explain why he is against masks when research supports wearing them to limit the spread of the coronavirus. ""The studies that I have seen, the studies that have been most popular over the last 100 days of this crisis, have said mask or social distancing. So if you're maintaining basic social distancing, like I do, there's no reason to have an additional mask on top of that,"" Sabatini said July 15. Is that really what the research shows? Scientists said he is wrong. ""Doing both provides best but likely not complete protection,"" said Volker Mai, a University of Florida epidemiologist. Masks alone don’t guarantee protection from the virus. But they can help slow down the spread. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wear cloth face coverings in public when around people who don’t live in their household, ""especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain."" Studies show cloth face coverings reduce the spray of droplets carrying the virus. Sabatini did not respond to our query about the recent studies he was citing by deadline. About a week earlier, Sabatini tweeted a link to a 2006 paper by researchers at the Center for Biosecurity of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Baltimore about disease mitigation measures amid pandemics. The paper, which included a couple of paragraphs about masks, stated that many in the public in Asia wore surgical masks during the SARS pandemic. ""Studies have shown that the ordinary surgical mask does little to prevent inhalation of small droplets bearing influenza virus,"" it said. ""The pores in the mask become blocked by moisture from breathing, and the air stream simply diverts around the mask. There are few data available to support the efficacy of N95 or surgical masks outside a healthcare setting."" We interviewed three of the co-authors of the 2006 paper about Sabatini’s comment. Each one stressed the current medical advice that wearing masks reduces the likelihood that someone who is unaware that they are contagious will spread the virus. ""That paper was 14 years ago and accurately reflected what was known at the time,"" said Dr. Tom Inglesby, who is now the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""We have learned a lot in the course of this pandemic."" Inglesby pointed to the current universal masking recommendation from the CDC leadership which cites research that found universal masking was associated with a significantly lower rate of COVID-19 among health care workers at a Massachusetts hospital system, it found. ""This and other current studies support the use of masking by the public, and I do recommend the use of masks and social distancing together,"" said Inglesby, who testified before a congressional committee in May in favor of cloth mask wearing. Dr. Tara O’Toole, one of the coauthors, noted that the 2006 paper referred to masks as protection for the wearer. The point of wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic is not to protect oneself, but to protect those around you. ""I wear my mask to protect you. You wear your mask to protect me,"" O’Toole said. A June study published in The Lancet medical journal found that ""face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection."" One reason experts recommend wearing masks and social distancing indoors is that a person can’t always prevent others from coming within six feet. ""It is impossible — impossible — to always stay six feet away from others, indoors,"" said Andrew Noymer, a disease prevention expert at UC Irvine. ""Someone brushes past in the grocery-store aisle. Someone is leaving the bathroom just as we go in. Indoor air circulation is unpredictable due to HVAC idiosyncrasies. Best practice is to mask AND distance."" Sabatini said on CNN that if you maintain social distancing indoors ""there's no reason to have an additional mask on top of that."" Multiple scientists and the CDC say that it is best to wear a mask indoors in public in addition to other measures including social distancing and hand washing. We did not find research to support Sabatini’s claim that if you social distance you don’t need to wear a mask, too. We rate this statement .",false,"Florida, Coronavirus, Anthony Sabatini, "

When asked, four out of five Americans say the cost of drugs is ""unreasonable."" Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., has signed on to a bevy of plans to bring prices down. ""There are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America, from pharmaceutical companies to insurers,"" Booker said at the first Democratic debate in Miami. The Trump campaign fired off a reminder that Booker has history with the drug makers. ""Cory Booker has accepted over $400,000 from the pharmaceutical industry during his political career,"" @TrumpWarRoom tweeted June 26, the night of the first Democratic debate. FACT: Cory Booker has accepted over $400,000 from the pharmaceutical industry during his political career. pic.twitter.com/1HUfFVBGVU By one measure, that number is correct. But a more granular look at drug maker political money delivers a lower number, and the tweet gives no hint that Booker stopped taking pharmaceutical money in 2017. The Trump campaign sent us to Booker’s career summary page on the Open Secrets website, a reliable source of federal political money data. Booker first ran for Senate in 2013. Since then, people and groups tied to the pharmaceutical/health products industry have given Booker $411,948. The number is actually higher. Booker runs a leadership PAC, a common device on Capitol Hill to raise money for a variety of uses, from travel expenses to helping other candidates fund their campaigns. Booker’s PAC got $56,000 since 2014, for a grand total of $468,000. There’s an important caveat: That industry group includes much more than drug makers. Drug wholesalers, medical equipment makers and dietary supplement companies all fall under this category. The wholesalers would have a stake in bills aimed at lowering prescription drug costs, but many other companies, such as Nestlé, which owns several dietary supplement brands, and Medtronic, maker of insulin pumps and much more, would go untouched by such legislation. Boiled down to drug makers alone, according to data pulled by the Open Secrets staff, Booker’s total is $327,000. That includes both donations to his campaign committee and his leadership PAC. One last wrinkle would add some money back in. The Trump campaign tweet was based solely on Booker’s federal receipts. But as mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013, Booker raised millions. Some of that came from people tied to drug makers. A notable example is Jonathan Sackler, a member of the family behind Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. In 2009, Sackler gave $26,000 to Booker Team for Newark, a joint campaign committee to help elect Booker and a slate of city councilors. At the end of the day, we found that drug makers gave Booker’s campaigns upwards of $350,000. That’s less than the tweet claimed, but still a hefty amount. And if drug wholesalers are added in, the gap largely disappears. In June 2017, Booker told NPR he had stopped taking industry donations. ""We put a pause on even receiving contributions from pharma companies because it arouses so much criticism,"" Booker said. Recently, he tweeted, ""Big pharma companies need to be held criminally liable for the opioid crisis. I’ve said I would not take contributions from corporate PACs, from pharma executives — they are part of this problem."" Big pharma companies need to be held criminally liable for the opioid crisis. I’ve said I would not take contributions from corporate PACs, from pharma executives — they are part of this problem. It’s time to work on a solution. Chip in to help us run a people-powered campaign As far as his PAC money, that revenue stream has died for Booker. Up through 2016, drug makers had given him $202,000. Since then, as the chart below shows, the amount from drug makers directly is zero, with some ongoing donations from individuals who work for drug makers. New Jersey is home to many large pharmaceutical companies, including Merck, Novartis and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Individuals who work for them have continued to give to Booker, but since 2016, that has fallen from nearly $100,000 to about $26,000. Booker’s campaign noted that he joined with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on a drug importation bill. Booker also put forward legislation that would allow the Medicare program to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs. These and other measures have drawn strong opposition from the drug industry.

611,27876,The sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation.,"April 17, 2014",Giant Hogweed Identification (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation),Snopes Staff,"In July 2013, many in the online world became aware of the hazard posed by the giant hogweed via forwardings of the full text of a 2010 Toronto National Post article reporting that the toxic plant had just been discovered growing wild in eastern Ontario: Is it a fact that there is a plant called a giant Hogweed that its toxic properties are on all parts of the plant and touching it causes burns that turn into blisters? It has been reported on 3 e-mails I received today. The plant overtakes fields and grows to over 10 feet. The plant is supposed to be indigenous to Europe. It was reported in the e-mail that it is in South western Ontario, Canada and finding its way everywhere and the warning is to report it and never touch it. Its flowers resemble a giant Queen Anne’s Lace weed. Both the plant and the description of the effects of contact with its sap are real. Giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) is an invasive herb in the carrot family which was originally brought to North America from Asia and has since become established in the New England, Mid-Atlantic, and Northwest regions of the United States. Giant hogweed grows along streams and rivers and in fields, forests, yards and roadsides, and a giant hogweed plant can reach 14 feet or more in height with compound leaves up to 5 feet in width. Giant hogweed sap contains toxic chemicals known as furanocoumarins. When these chemicals come into contact with the skin and are exposed to sunlight, they cause a condition called phytophotodermatitis, a reddening of the skin often followed by severe blistering and burns. These injuries can last for several months, and even after they have subsided the affected areas of skin can remain sensitive to light for years. Furanocoumarins are also carcinogenic and teratogenic, meaning they can cause cancer and birth defects. The sap can also cause temporary (or even permanent) blindness if introduced into the eyes. If someone comes into physical contact with giant hogweed, the following steps should be taken: If a reaction occurs, the early application of topical steroids may lessen the severity of the reaction and ease the discomfort. The affected area of skin may remain sensitive to sunlight for a few years, so applying sun block and keeping the affected area shielded from the sun whenever possible are sensible precautions. Hogweed is far from the only dangerous plant one might expect to encounter. Others we’ve written about include oleander (a flowering shrub often used in gardens and along freeways to provide decorative screening) and sago palm (a decorative shrub found in gardens and kept in pots within some homes).

612,25929,“We have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world” from COVID-19.,"July 20, 2020","The United States doesn’t have one of the world’s lowest mortality rates from the coronavirus. No fewer than 15 advanced, industrialized nations currently have a lower mortality rate, as do a host of other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, Turkey, Argentina, and India. Another measurement called the case-fatality rate, which Trump incorrectly referred to as the “mortality rate,” also doesn’t place the United States at or near the bottom internationally.",Louis Jacobson,"President Donald Trump defended his performance in fighting the coronavirus during an interview with Fox News’ Chris Wallace, insisting that the mortality rate from COVID-19 in the United States is among the world’s lowest. In the interview that aired July 19, Wallace and Trump were in the middle of a discussion about the coronavirus’ impact. Wallace said that ""we have the seventh-highest mortality rate in the world. Our mortality rate is higher than Brazil, it's higher than Russia and the European Union has us on a travel ban."" Trump responded that ""when you talk about mortality rates, I think it's the opposite. I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world."" When Wallace fact-checked that characterization, Trump doubled down: ""I heard we had the best mortality rate. Number one low mortality rate."" Trump is wrong. Neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to an inquiry for this article. Scientists define ""mortality rate"" as a measure of how frequently death occurs within a defined population. Data on this question is imperfect because of reporting inconsistencies between and even within countries. We turned to widely cited coronavirus data compiled by Johns Hopkins University to analyze Trump’s assertion. Specifically, we looked at the university’s calculations of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 in population, which is a standard measurement of mortality rate. First, we compared the United States with other nations that have been hard-hit by the coronavirus. To do this, we looked at all nations that have recorded at least 100,000 confirmed cases. The United States has the sixth-highest mortality rate using this metric, behind the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Chile and France. But 16 hard-hit nations had a lower mortality rate: Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Iran, Colombia, Germany, South Africa, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Argentina, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. We also looked at how the United States compared with its peers among advanced industrialized nations. In this comparison, six countries had higher mortality rates than the United States: Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Sweden, and France. But 15 countries had lower mortality rates than the United States: Ireland, the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, Austria, Finland, Norway, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. By neither comparison is Trump close to correct. Mortality rate is strongly related to the age distribution in a country, said Brooke Nichols, a health economist and infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. ""The countries with the lowest mortality rates will probably end up being the ones with the younger population age structures,"" she said. When ""Fox News Sunday"" aired the interview, Wallace said the White House had been referring to the ""case-fatality rate"" rather than the mortality rate. (White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany handed Trump a paper chart citing ""case-fatality rate"" during the interview.) The case-fatality rate is not the same as the mortality rate. The case-fatality rate shows how likely you are to die from the coronavirus if you are infected with it. The mortality rate shows how common it is to die of coronavirus in a particular population, such as a country. Trump’s point about the U.S. is not more accurate when looking at the case-fatality rate compared with other countries. Nine countries have a higher case-fatality rate than the United States. One country, Peru, has an equal rate and 11 have a lower rate: Colombia, Chile, Turkey, India, Pakistan, Argentina, Russia, South Africa, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Nichols said that the younger populations of many developing countries helps explain why their case-fatality rates are lower than that of the United States. (Infected patients who are younger and, often, healthier tend to die at lower rates from the coronavirus.) And when you compare the United States with its industrialized peers, seven countries have a lower case-fatality rate: Austria, Portugal, Norway, South Korea, Luxembourg, New Zealand and Australia. Nichols said that the U.S ranks relatively low on this measure because, despite its problems rolling out testing, it still handles more tests per capita than most other comparable countries. Trump said, ""We have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world"" from coronavirus. The United States doesn’t have one of the world’s lowest mortality rates from the coronavirus: No fewer than 15 advanced, industrialized nations currently have a lower mortality rate, as do a host of other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, Turkey, Argentina, and India.

614,21727,"I've created over 40,000 jobs.","July 19, 2011","Former Ruth's Chris CEO Craig Miller says he 'created over 40,000 jobs'",Becky Bowers,"Usually when politicians claim that they created jobs, they are talking about jobs created by the private sector while they held public office. And we're skeptical. But when that politician is a former Ruth's Chris Steak House chief executive running on his business credentials, well, we're curious. If a CEO can't take credit for job creation, who can? Craig Miller, a Republican who jumped into politics with a 2010 primary run for an Orlando-area congressional seat (he finished third), announced in July 2011 that he would run for the U.S. Senate. That made him a relative newcomer facing Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos, former U.S. Sen. George LeMieux, former state House Majority Leader Adam Hasner and former U.S. Army Col. Mike McCalister. (Haridopolos thinned the field by dropping out less than a week later.) Miller, 61, explained his decision to ""take on the career politicians"" in a four-paragraph essay on his website. Here's the third paragraph: ""Those that have had a chance to lead have failed us. The politicians we have trusted to represent us are the ones who have gotten us into the mess we now face. The time for new leadership is now. I'm a businessman. I've been fortunate enough to live the American Dream, starting in the dish room and working my way up to the board room. Along the way, I've created over 40,000 jobs and I've spent my career in the restaurant industry balancing budgets and meeting payroll. I know the kind of pro-growth and pro-job environment we need to get our economy moving again. My life experiences have prepared me to go to Washington and take on the career politicians and entrenched interests that only know how to spend your money."" We saw the same number in a campaign news release a day later and wondered: Did Craig Miller, restaurant executive, create 40,000 jobs? Here's how Miller told us he did the math. He explained that he started his executive career with the company that owned Red Lobster in 1973, back when the restaurant chain was only in the Southeast. (The company was called General Mills Restaurants, before General Mills spun it off as the behemoth Darden Restaurants in 1995. Heard of Olive Garden? LongHorn Steakhouse? Yeah, them.) Red Lobster's extraordinary growth — hundreds of new restaurants while Miller was there — meant lots of new jobs. In 1984 Miller joined Uno Restaurant Corp., helping transform pizza joint Pizzeria Uno into Uno Chicago Grill, where he landed his first CEO gig in 1996. By the time he left in 2001, Uno Chicago Grill had grown by more than 180 restaurants, creating yet more jobs. After a quick stint at already troubled Furr's Restaurant Group, he took on a higher-profile role at what became Ruth's Hospitality Group, where he was chief executive from 2004 to 2008. Before he left, he said, the high-end Ruth's Chris had added about 30 steak houses. So, to him, the math is simple: More than 700 new restaurants opened during his career, multiplied by an average number of about 60 new employees per restaurant, for more than 40,000 jobs. (For his specific estimates, see box.) Miller said his job claim did not include a National Restaurant Association stat-booster that says every restaurant job supports almost a full position elsewhere in the economy, which he figured would have put his job creation total ""somewhere north of 80,000 or 90,000."" ""I tried to be conservative, because I come from a financial analysis background,"" he said. ""I wanted to make sure we don't overstate what I've done."" With Miller's calculus in hand, we started our own search, chatting with folks and digging through old news clips and earnings releases to piece together the numbers — and Miller's role in them. We'll accept the average-employees-per-restaurant figure of 62.5 that Miller used in making his claim — after checking with experts and industry data. And his estimates for the numbers of restaurants that popped up during his tenure at a handful of companies, while not exact, were generally close when we spot-checked them against business stories and earnings reports from the time. As for his role: Certainly, the guy has a reputation as a growth machine. Chris Muller, the dean of hospitality administration at Boston University, was an expert in chain restaurants at University of Central Florida when he met Miller. He named Miller UCF's restaurateur of the year in 2000 and featured him at a European food service conference. He also invested in Ruth's Chris when Miller took it public in 2005. He described Miller's approach as ""very aggressive"" as the head of Uno, which grew from just 10 to 15 restaurants when he joined as a vice president to nearly 200 when he left as CEO, and said he was similarly expansion-focused at Ruth's Chris, where he took the company public, creating additional pressure for growth. ""So he does have a history of creating positions for people,"" Muller said. Of course, that growth also meant Ruth's Chris was stretched thin as the economy started to flail, and its stock price dove. The board asked Miller to leave in 2008. Miller's expansionist style had its ""positives and negatives,"" Muller said, but you couldn't deny he was a ""growth-oriented CEO."" But what about his role before he was a head honcho? Miller's campaign manager pointed us to Bill Bridges, who worked with Miller for most of the 1970s, starting at General Mills as director of personnel the year before Miller came on board. He recalls a bright, hard-working guy who analyzed sites for expansion and made presentations to the executive committee about where to build. ""From that perspective, he was integral to the growth of the company,"" he said. Miller's own two-page biography says he held positions at General Mills in finance, planning and analysis, development, real estate, corporate growth and purchasing. But he was there for over a decade. We had to know: Did he jump in with both feet, spawning Red Lobsters from his first months at General Mills in his early 20s? And that's when part of the story got off track. In 1996, when Miller was named CEO of Uno Restaurant Corp., the Boston Business Journal wrote a profile. It told of Miller's journey from high-school dishwasher to Vietnam Air Force veteran to accounting major at Florida State University. Then it described his start with General Mills in Tallahassee, after he wrote the company a letter asking about positions at Red Lobster. He didn't yet have his business degree, but ""in 1973 became a part-time auditor of the local restaurant."" Later, the article says, he was asked to audit the books of another Red Lobster in Central Florida. He finished his degree at University of Central Florida in 1974, it says, and started working in payroll. Eventually he became vice president of finance. Which means Miller claims to have created jobs at restaurants that sprang up as he was a 20-something part-time auditor and then a payroll employee. It's not clear how long it took for him to reach management. The claim gets even murkier when you look closely at his own bio. General Mills Restaurants' success was led by the blockbuster growth of Red Lobster, which by 1983 — just 15 years after the first restaurant opened — had 350 locations in 36 states and had started to reach into Japan, according to New York Times article at the time. But while Craig Miller's General Mills career started with paper-pushing, the last part focused on a chain with a far less impressive legacy than Red Lobster. As a finance guy, Miller had helped General Mills put together the acquisition of small Mexican food chain Casa Gallardo, according to the Boston Business Journal. His biography notes that after that deal in 1979, his ""primary duties"" were as vice president of the Mexican chain. Starting with just a handful of restaurants — one, according to his bio, or five, according to the Business Journal — Miller and Ramon Gallardo took the Casa Gallardo chain to 34. The goal, said an article at the time, had been 100. Not long after Miller had moved on to Pizzeria Uno, General Mills dumped the chain, which by then numbered just 25. It had been profitable for General Mills, just not profitable enough. ""We didn't get it all put together with the speed that enabled us to capitalize,"" company spokesman Dean Belbas told Minneapolis-St. Paul City Business shortly after the sale. Why does any of this matter? Well, in Miller's back-of-the-napkin math, new Red Lobsters made up nearly half the jobs he claimed credit for. But those include new Red Lobsters while he was a part-time auditor. New Red Lobsters while he worked in payroll. New Red Lobsters while he worked in finance. New Red Lobsters as he built Casa Gallardo. His campaign's response? ""He was the top financial and economic adviser to the CEO and was directly involved in all aspects of the company's business, even while serving as vice president of Casa Gallardo,"" campaign manager Paul Ciaramitaro said. ""Craig had a vital hand in the company expansion and job creation at General Mills during the 1970s and into the 1980s."" But was Miller ultimately responsible? More so than Red Lobster's founder, Bill Darden, or the man who followed in his footsteps, former Darden Restaurants chairman and CEO Joe Lee? Joe Lee did tell the Boston Business Journal in 1996 he considered Miller ""one of the industry's top leaders."" (We attempted to reach him at home, unsuccessfully.) But we would dare to speculate he wouldn't credit Miller with every job at every restaurant General Mills added from 1973 to 1984. Where does this leave us? Several folks told us that Miller's a respected restaurateur. Like Herman Cain, a former president and CEO of the National Restaurant Association, he served in leadership there as chairman of the board. Companies grew dramatically under his corporate leadership. But to reach 40,000 jobs created, Miller takes credit for thousands of jobs he wasn't in a position to create. Growth at Red Lobster, early in his career, accounts for 46 percent of his estimate — and it's a stretch to credit him for even half of that. He also counts job gains only and not losses — something any politician relying on net job creation numbers can't do. And we can't know how many jobs he actually added to communities — for every Casa Gallardo, a local mom-and-pop may have closed or had layoffs — though in strong economies, every job may have indeed added to the overall total. Make no mistake, our reporting shows Miller was a gung ho restaurant CEO who stressed expansion and by extension, job creation. A lower jobs number may have rated higher on the Truth-O-Meter. But 40,000 jobs? He just hasn't proved it. We rate this claim Barely True. Here's how Craig Miller breaks down his career job creation, with Red Lobster representing nearly half of the total: Miller's role: Joined as president and CEO; from Sept. 2006, also chairman of the board Restaurants added by company during tenure: 37 Estimated jobs created: 2,313 Miller's role: Joined as vice president for administration responsible for development and franchising, became executive vice president/chief operating officer, then in 1996 president and chief executive officer Restaurants added by company during tenure: About 185 Estimated jobs created: 11,563 Miller's role: Joined as part-time auditor before earning college degree; moved to payroll; held positions in finance, planning and analysis, development, real estate, corporate growth and purchasing; after acquisition of Casa Gallardo in 1979, primary duties were as vice president of Casa Gallardo Restaurants added by company during tenure: Casa Gallardo, about 30; Red Lobster, about 325; other brands, about 125 Estimated jobs created: 30,000 Sources: Craig Miller campaign, Boston Business Journal Notes: Restaurants added don't include acquisitions.

615,29499,Three Syrian refugees raped and murdered a 5-year-old girl at knifepoint in Idaho.,"June 20, 2016","What's true: Police investigated a 2 June 2016 incident in Twin Falls, Idaho, involving a five-year-old girl and three boys aged seven, ten, and fourteen. What's false: The incident was not a rape, the girl was not murdered, the boys involved were not Syrian, a knife was not used, and no ""language barrier"" prevented police from investigating or detaining two boys involved.",Kim LaCapria,"In June 2016, online outlets began reporting a rumor that three Syrian refugees had raped a 5-year-old Idaho girl at knifepoint, that police were lax in investigating the case, and that news media were refusing to cover the story: Proving a dangerous bias, the media have remained eerily silent on the horrific events that occurred on June 2. In a shameless bid to protect their leftist agenda, news outlets have given only vague details of the disturbing case, however, an outraged neighbor has come forward with the full story that is sure to put a damper on the federal refugee resettlement program. KMVT reported on June 7 that a sexual assault occurred near the Fawnbrook Apartment complex in Twin Falls, Idaho. Only stating that no charges have been filed, according to prosecutor Grant Loebs, the station concludes that allegations are swirling on social media from an eye witness. Although they’ve done well not to give any hint of who the perpetrators are, why they’re being investigated, or who the victim is, a neighbor has broken the silence out of pure indignance over the authorities’ handling of the case. The boys are ages 13, 10, and 8, and are Syrian refugee children from 2 families resettled in the apartments. What happened next is too sickening for mere words … [A] neighbor states that the Syrian boys stripped the girl naked, raped her, and urinated on her body and in her mouth. Although the two younger boys were unable to perform sexually due to their ages, the 13 “coached” the pair while he videoed the sexual assault after his own participation. The rumor made its way to a conspiracy-oriented web site, whose headline on the topic blared: “REPORT: THREE SYRIAN ‘REFUGEES; RAPE LITTLE GIRL AT KNIFEPOINT IN IDAHO; Furious residents accuse council of cover-up.” The headline made no mention of the ages of the “refugees” involved and asserted that police had declined to act due to a “language barrier”: Three Syrian refugees reportedly raped a little girl at knifepoint in Idaho before urinating on her body, an incident that prompted furious residents to accuse Twin Falls city council members of covering up the assault. The little girl was playing outside Fawnbrook apartment buildings when the boys put a knife to her throat and forced her inside a laundry unit. She was then stripped naked, raped and urinated on. The 13-year-old reportedly told the younger boys to urinate on her because they were incapable of ejaculating. The victim’s grandmother found the victim and then called the girl’s mother, who called the police. The police took 2 and a half hours to arrive but were unable to take any action due to the “language barrier”. When she arrived, the mother of the alleged rapists was only able to say “no police,” while the father reportedly congratulated his 13-year-old son. Video of the entire assault was captured on the boy’s cellphone. A follow-up KMTV report revealed that, “the case has officially been sealed by a judge with no chance of it ever being unsealed since all parties involved are minors.” A video of a Twin Falls council meeting shows irate residents demanding to know why council members have done nothing to address the alleged rape, as well as numerous other issues involving Syrian refugees being housed in the area, including hit and run incidents and Muslims spitting on non-Muslims. We contacted county prosecutor Grant Loebs to obtain first-hand information about the rumors. He confirmed to us that an incident did take place at the Fawnbrook Apartment complex in Twin Falls, Idaho, on 2 June 2016 involving  a five-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy, a ten-year-old boy, and a 14-year-old boy. Loebs said that the three boys were of Middle Eastern descent, but they were not Syrian and he had no information indicating they were refugees. Because the case is still being investigated and involves minors, Loebs was unable to disclose many of its details. However, he confirmed that police have indeed been aggressively investigating leads in the case, observing all normal procedural practices rather than declining to act due to any purported language barriers. Officers have also interviewed the girl and all of the boys involved, with the ten- and fourteen-year-old boys having been detained in juvenile custody during the ongoing investigation. Loebs told us there was no indication a knife was involved in the incident, and that no one was “raped” or murdered (although contact of a sensitive nature allegedly occurred). Moreover, he stated that the investigation was a police matter, not one involving the local city council (which has no jurisdiction in criminal cases). Loebs subsequently provided much the same information to local news media:  “There were no Syrians involved, there was no knife involved, there was no gang-rape,” Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs said. His comments largely refute several differing accounts about the incident circulating on anti-refugee resettlement and conspiracy websites and anti-Muslim blogs. Most of those accounts claim a group of Syrian refugees sexually assaulted a mentally disabled girl at knife-point June 2 in the laundry facilities of Fawnbrook Apartments, a low-income housing complex in Twin Falls, and that the attack was celebrated by the perpetrators’ families as city officials orchestrated a cover-up. An incident did occur, Loebs said, and two juveniles have been charged after authorities obtained video shot on a cellphone. But the details of the case don’t match what’s being reported by anti-refugee groups, the prosecutor said. There were no adults involved, Loebs said, the boys didn’t have a knife, and the incident wasn’t a “gang-rape” instigated by the oldest boy. “All those involved are juveniles, and the older one didn’t touch the victim in any way,” Loebs said. Only one person is alleged to have touched the victim, said the prosecutor, though he declined to elaborate. Various officials attributed the spread of much of the misinformation reported about the case to locals opposed to refugee resettlement in their area:  Loebs said he didn’t want to “fan the flames of anti-Syrian refugee people” but suspects the false reports are the work of a local group opposed to refugee resettlement who hoped to stir up trouble by claiming the incident involved Syrian refugees who committed a violent sexual assault. “There is a small group of people in Twin Falls County whose life goal is to eliminate refugees, and thus far they have not been constrained by the truth,” Loebs said. “They have not been constrained by the truth in the past, and I don’t expect them to be constrained by the truth in the future.” Loebs said sex cases between minors aren’t uncommon and implied that this case is being exploited by the local anti-refugee movement to make a political point. No Syrians have been settled in Twin Falls through Idaho refugee programs, said Jan Reeves, director of the Idaho Office for Refugees. “There have been periodic website postings about hundreds of Syrians coming to Idaho that have all proven to be false in the past, and this is probably just one of those attempts to try and stir up hatred and bigotry,” he said. Echoing statements by the prosecutor, Zeze Rwasama, director of the CSI Refugee Center, said refugee opponents are trying to promote an agenda, particularly against Syrian refugees. He asked residents to confirm facts and refrain from speculating online. “It breaks my heart when people in the community are divided around issues of resettling refugees,” he said. Twin Falls Police Chief Craig Kingsbury later stated at a press conference that the boys involved were of Iraqi and Sudanese (not Syrian) descent, that “something a lot less serious than a sexual assault” was initially reported to police, and that none of the boys’ families were congratulating them following whatever took place:  At a press conference in Twin Falls, Chief Kingsbury addressed community members and the city council about the alleged assault and explained that two of the three boys involved in the incident are at a detention center following the alleged crime. The boys are reported to have been in the Twin Falls area for less than two years. The police chief also said there is no evidence to support claims the suspects’ fathers high-fived or praised the boys for committing the alleged assault, as has been reported on anti-refugee websites. Further refuting claims made in the stories online that police bungled the investigation or tried to cover it up, Loebs said the police investigated the incident thoroughly, interviewed everyone who needed to be and followed proper protocols. Kingsbury also addressed claims that it took the police department more than two hours to respond. “Simply, that just is not true,” the chief said. “The Twin Falls Police Department, the Magic Valley Paramedics, even the Twin Falls County Sheriff’s Office, responded in due time.” Earlier in his comments, Kingsbury said the call originally came in as “something a lot less serious than a sexual assault or lewd and lascivious conduct.” Chief Kingsbury was unable to confirm or deny if the boys are refugees. Multiple news outlets have indeed covered the incident, and they have “given only vague details of the disturbing case” because its active status and the involvement of minors precludes officials from providing more detail:  The criminal cases against those juveniles have been sealed, as is customary when children are charged. Although prosecutors and police are barred from discussing certain details in sealed juvenile cases,  [NOTE: The photograph displayed at the head of this article is unrelated to this case and does not picture anyone actually involved in the reported incident.]",false,"Uncategorized, idaho, infowars, mad world news"
616,9000,UTA researcher patents “roach motel” for cancer,"May 21, 2018","This news release announces the European patent for a medical device that is designed to attract, trap and kill cancer cells. Ostensibly, the device could be used to detect early signs of metastasis in various forms of cancer, and potentially could find use in cancer treatment. However, the device’s utility at this point appears to be largely hypothetical. The release indicates that no clinical trials have been done; offers no information on benefits (or health risks) associated with such a device; and says nothing about the potential costs associated with such a device. Indeed, the release does not tell readers anything about the research that underlies the device. Based on the information in the release, the device appears to be — at this point — little more than a concept. As the National Cancer Institute notes, “Cancer has a major impact on society in the United States and across the world.” Indeed, cancers claim the lives of hundreds of thousands of people each year in the United States alone. With that in mind, it is important to be cautious when announcing a new tool that “can be used for early diagnosis and treatment of metastasized cancer.” To be more specific, one should at the very least be prepared to provide meaningful information to support the claim. Securing a patent may be valuable — both financially and for the public good — but that value can only be realized if the relevant technology can be used in a clinical setting. This release offers more questions than answers, with the foremost question being: will the device work in people?","Matt Shipman,Adam Cifu, MD,Kathlyn Stone","Cost is not mentioned. While it can be extremely difficult to place a precise cost on early stage medical technologies, the issue can be addressed in broader terms. Is the technology difficult to make? Can it be produced on a large scale? Are those questions that still need to be explored? This release neglects to do so, which is particularly problematic in a news release that is focused on the announcement of a patent. Patents are designed to secure intellectual property, allowing people and institutions to profit from their discoveries. As such, this release is effectively about business. Failing to address potential costs, even in the most general terms, is a significant oversight. Benefits are not put into any numerical context. In fact, benefits are discussed only in the most general of terms, referring to “early diagnosis” and the idea of “recruit[ing] the cancer cells into a small area where we can treat them with less overall side effects to the whole body.” However, the release also raises questions about how viable these potential benefits may be in human cancer patients. We’ll address this further under “Quality of Evidence.” Potential harms are not addressed. That may be for reasons that we’ll address under “Quality of Evidence.” The release provides little information to support its claims regarding the “cancer trap” that has been patented. There are two statements in the release that are particularly worth highlighting. First, the release states that: “The trap has been tested in the lab and proved effective on many kinds of cancer cells, including melanoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia and esophageal cancer.” What sort of testing are they referring to? In vitro testing, wherein the technology was tested outside of a living organism? In vivo testing in an animal model, such as lab mice? Was this work peer reviewed or published anywhere? Second, the release quotes the lead researcher as saying: “We are hoping to move toward clinical trials in the next few years as this technology could potentially significantly increase the lifespan of cancer patients.” This statement would seem to indicate that the technology has not yet been tested in clinical trials. In other words, this statement seems to tell readers that the technology has never been tested in humans. That would mean we have no idea whether this technology could benefit human cancer patients, or what risks it may pose to patients. If this work has been done, the release needs to reference it. No disease mongering here. The release explains the rationale for the device and notes that it would be “complementary to current cancer treatments.” While the release does mention the institution’s overall level of funding for cancer research, it does not say where any of that funding came from — much less who funded the “cancer trap” research. Federal agencies? The private sector? Nonprofit organizations? The release offers only the broadest possible language regarding diagnosis and treatment of metastasizing cancers. We appreciate that it would be impossible to provide a detailed overview of the existing diagnosis and treatment options in a news release. However, we would expect some discussion of how the “cancer trap” would compare to existing techniques and technologies. This is missing. The release appears to be in conflict with itself here. On the one hand, the first paragraph talks about the patenting of an implantable medical device. On the other hand, the release also tells us that the researchers are “hoping to move toward clinical trials in the next few years.” The first paragraph may make many readers think this is a prototype that may be close to the market. But the lack of a timeline for clinical trials suggests that this could be many years away from clinical use (if it reaches clinical use at all). This lack of clarity is problematic. The language in the release is so broad that it is difficult to know what to compare it to. However, a quick search has no trouble finding other research efforts aimed at “trapping” cancer cells, such as this 2015 paper, this 2017 paper, or these news releases from 2014 and 2016. What sets this newly patented “cancer trap” apart? The release doesn’t tell us, because the release provides no context related to previous work in the field. The release tells readers that “This cancer trap can be used for early diagnosis and treatment of metastasized cancer.” The release also says “This method is effective for both diagnosing and treating metastasis cancer and can be used in combination with traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy” and “We have also found it very effective in late stage cancers to stop the spread of the disease and to prolong lifespan.” Those are bold statements. But the release provides no information to support them and in fact raises doubt about their veracity when they state that no clinical trials have been done. Instead, the release also includes language that raises questions about the extent to which anyone knows how well the technology will perform in human patients. If the researchers have evidence that this technology is a significant advance for cancer diagnosis and treatment, the release doesn’t share it. While it may be interesting and newsworthy that a patent has been issued for this idea, this type of coverage is misdirected. It would be better covered in a brief report that states that the patent have been issued based on the hypothesis and suggests next steps in research.",false,"cancer trap,University of Texas at Arlington"
617,29226,A woman in South Korea was impregnated via mouth after eating a squid.,"May 17, 2018","What's true: A woman received several painful stings after she ate a squid's sperm bag in 2011. What's false: This woman was not impregnated by a squid, nor did she spit out baby squids.",Dan Evon,"A series of misleading and exaggerated headlines over the span of several years turned a story about a woman’s painful dining experience into a rumor about getting pregnant from a squid — via mouth. This turned into a battle of headlines as the facts . For example, an article published by The Sun in 2012 read: “Woman ‘pregnant’ with 12 baby squid.” Not to be outdone, the Mirror reported that the South Korean woman had become “pregnant by squid” and warned readers that they should “be careful when putting seafood in your mouth” because “you could end up spitting out babies.” Stories about the squeam-inducing squid encounter have been published by a wide range of outlets over the years. Most recently, this story was featured on an episode of Weird Wild World from the Facebook page “Nameless.tv”:  Some truth underlies these stories, but associated headlines (as well as some of the details) are severely misleading or wholly inaccurate and have led some readers to believe that a woman was “impregnated” by a squid via her mouth. The most misleading aspect of this rumor comes down to the words “pregnant” or “impregnate.” Although these words were frequently employed by outlets presumably hoping to generate clicks on their stories, they are inaccurate. The episode of Weird Wild World was actually referring to a case report originally published in Pathology International in September 2011: We present a case of stinging in the oral cavity caused by ingestion of the sperm bags of a squid. The patient experienced severe pain in her oral cavity immediately after eating raw squid. When she was examined at our hospital, we found that several small whitish spindle‐shaped stings were stuck to the mucous membrane of the hard palate. A biopsy was performed, and the whitish stings were removed as well. We also performed a histological examination of the remaining part of the raw squid brought by the patient. The biopsy showed that the sperm bags of the squid had thrust into the squamous epithelium of the patient. The remaining part of the raw squid consisted of the testis and the sperm bags. After removal of all stings, the pain reduced, and the wound healed in due course. Larva migrans and anisakiasis are infections known to be caused by consumption of raw seafood. Although the condition reported here is relatively rare, doctors should also keep this condition in mind for patients reporting pain after eating raw seafood. This woman, who was identified as a 63-year-old Korean woman in a subsequent report in the Journal of Parasitology, ate a sperm bag while ingesting a piece of raw squid. As Science 2.0 — one of the first web sites to pick up on this story when it first went viral in June 2012 — noted in their report about these rumors, there is a big difference between “inseminate” and “impregnate”:\ On Thursday I reported that a woman’s mouth had been inseminated by a squid she was eating. To be specific, squid spermatophores (packages of sperm) implanted themselves into her mucus membranes, and had to be removed by a doctor. Several sources have now erroneously reported that a woman was impregnated by a squid she was eating, and found baby squid in her mouth. Truth is strange — but this is fiction. “Impregnate” (in reproduction, not manufacturing) means that successful fertilization has already taken place: sperm met with egg and an embryo is developing. That did not happen. There was no impregnation, no pregnancy, and no baby squid. Exaggerated reports went one step further, claiming that the unfortunate woman had “squid babies” removed from where they had become embedded in her mouth: “A 63-year-old woman has become ‘pregnant’ with 12 baby squid after eating calamari.” This is another severe exaggeration. Doctors removed squid spermatophores, a capsule containing the squid sperm, from this woman’s mouth. For a number of scientific reasons (a human woman’s mouth is not the same as a female squid egg), these sperms never developed into baby squids. Although the story is bizarre, it is not without precedent. Several similar cases have been documented in various medical journals. A 2012 report in Zoomorphology examines these cases and explains that spermatophore attachment is autonomous (meaning it can occur without the aid of male or female squid) making the consumption of raw male squid a potentially hazardous dining experience: Male squid produce intricate spermatophores that, when transferred to the female, undergo the spermatophoric reaction, a complex process of evagination that leads to the attachment of the spermatangium, that is, the everted spermatophore containing the sperm mass. While this process is still not completely understood, the medical literature includes several reports of “oral stinging” (i.e., punctured wounds in the human oral cavity) following consumption of raw male squid, which contains undischarged spermatophores able to inflict such wounds. Moreover, spermatophore attachment is confirmed to be autonomous (i.e., performed by the spermatophore itself) in another squid species (possibly a loliginid), and the results strongly indicate that the attachment mechanism is not dependent upon a specialized epithelium, nor a mate’s specific chemical stimulus. From the pathological point of view, the best prophylactic measure at present is the removal of the internal organs of the raw squid prior to its consumption. Medical journals have documented several instances of people being stung by spermatophores after ingesting raw squid, but these reports, specifically an instance from 2011, were grossly misrepresented with clickbait headlines.",false,Junk News
619,30797,"Queen Elizabeth removed the Obamas from the guest list for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding after she learned that Michelle Obama tried to ""sneak a spot.","December 6, 2017","Unlike the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, this royal wedding is not an official state occasion and is regarded as a private ceremony, so there is no onus on the couple to invite political leaders.",David Emery,"The official guest list for the royal wedding of Britain’s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had not been released as of early December 2017, but that didn’t stop disreputable web sites from inventing politically-charged stories about who would and wouldn’t be invited. The pro-Trump fake news site Just News USA reported on 3 December 2017 that despite “kissing up” to the royal family and trying to “sneak” an invitation to Harry’s wedding, former United States President and First Lady Barack and Michelle Obama had been “personally removed” from the guest list by Queen Elizabeth: For eight years, Michelle Obama genuinely thought she was a queen and expected to be treated like one. Now that she’s a regular citizen, she’s having a hard time of letting go of her former status as the (failed) first lady and keeps trying to push her way into every major social scene where she doesn’t belong and is apparently not invited. When she heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl, she assumed it was her place to be on that guest list, which has to be approved by the Queen of England herself. Michelle made a desperation move to sneak a spot on that exclusive guest list and as soon as the real queen found out what the wannabe royalty did, she delivered a brutal beatdown that was definitely deserved. Several other sites, including the consistently unreliable  YourNewsWire.com, published slightly rearranged versions of the same article. For example: Invitations to Royal weddings in England have traditionally been extended to the sitting President of the United States and the current First Lady, so when Queen Elizabeth saw what Michelle Obama was up to – trying to sneak a spot at the wedding at the expense of the real POTUS and FLOTUS – she delivered Michelle a well-deserved and humiliating beatdown. While Barack Obama has been traveling around the world, operating as some kind of shadow president and attempting to undermine the real POTUS, Michelle has been trying to push her way into every major social event where she doesn’t belong and is apparently not invited. When Michelle Obama heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl, she assumed it was her rightful place to be on that guest list. Michelle made a desperate move to sneak a spot on the guest list, but unfortunately for the former First Lady, the guest list has to be approved by the Queen of England herself. There was no basis in fact for any of these claims. As of 30 November (just a few days before these reports began appearing), word from Kensington Palace was that the guest list was still “in the early stages of being compiled,” according to the Telegraph, and the royal betrothed would have “primary input” into who would be on that list. No mainstream news sources in England or anywhere else reported that the Obamas were on the outs with Queen Elizabeth, nor that the queen intended to disinvite them or other potential wedding guests. As a matter of fact, if anyone were likely to be disinvited, it would probably have been President Trump, judging from the Telegraph‘s report, for two reasons: one, because it would go against the established precedent, which is not to invite sitting U.S. presidents to British royal weddings; and two, because bride-to-be Meghan Markle, who is an American, is not a big fan of Trump, whom she has called “misogynistic” and “divisive.” The Obamas, on the other hand, have enjoyed a comparatively warm relationship with the royal family ever since 2009, when the then-First Lady broke with protocol and hugged the queen during their first meeting. Barack Obama was seen hanging out with groom-to-be Prince Harry as recently as May 2017: Prince Harry hosted former US President @BarackObama at Kensington Palace today. pic.twitter.com/9SWfSRY4FH — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 27, 2017  A 27 November 2017 article in Newsweek told a story very different from what would be reported by Just News USA and other fake news sites days later: The guest list hasn’t been set for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but a number of things could stand in the way of President Donald Trump getting an invite. But a former U.S. president might make the list, due to his friendship with the young British royal: Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle, who appear to have amiable relations with Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge. In the end, neither President Trump nor President Obama was invited, for reasons explained by the Palace: Kensington Palace announced that the royal couple would not be inviting political leaders to the event, at least not on the basis of their official position. Which means neither US President Donald Trump nor his predecessor Barack Obama will be there. Not even British Prime Minister Theresa May was deemed worthy of a place on the guest list. Instead, only personal friends of the couple will be inside Windsor Castle for the royal event of the year on May 19. “It has been decided that an official list of political leaders — both UK and international — is not required for Prince Harry and Ms. Markle’s wedding,” a Kensington Palace spokesman said. “Her Majesty’s Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by the royal household.” A White House official confirmed neither Trump nor first lady Melania were invited; nor was Prime Minister May, Downing Street said. A royal source said that while Harry and Meghan hoped to see Barack and Michelle Obama soon, the former US President and his wife would not be at the wedding. The source would not say definitively whether the Obamas — who are close to the royal couple — had been invited.",false,"Junk News, barack obama, fake news, just news usa"
620,17808,"Hank Johnson Says ""by reducing chronic health care costs in the State of Georgia, we can reduce the $32.8 billion lost each year due to lack of productivity and economic costs.","October 18, 2013","Johnson on target about health, productivity cost link",Eric Stirgus,"A Georgia congressman’s defense of the hotly debated health care law brought some skepticism from one PolitiFact reader. ""By reducing chronic health care costs in the State of Georgia, we can reduce the $32.8 billion lost each year due to lack of productivity and economic costs,"" Johnson, a Democrat from DeKalb County, wrote in a letter to Daniel Patterson. Patterson forwarded the letter to PolitiFact Georgia. We hadn’t heard this claim before and decided to do some research. Johnson spokesman Andy Phelan said the numbers came from a study done by the Milken Institute, a nonpartisan, economic think tank with offices in Southern California and Washington, D.C. In October 2007, the institute released a widely reported study called ""An Unhealthy America: The Economic Burden of Chronic Disease."" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about the study. The study’s first sentence highlighted the trouble. ""More than half of Americans suffer from one or more chronic diseases,"" it read. The seven diseases the 240-page study focused on were cancer, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, mental disorder, pulmonary conditions and strokes. In 2003, there were 162.2 million Americans who suffered from one or more of those conditions, the study found. The productivity losses associated with those seven diseases were about $1.1 trillion. In Georgia, the Milken Institute researchers wrote in their study that the economic impact was $32.8 billion, as Johnson said. The researchers found about 5 million cases of those conditions were reported by Georgians in 2003. Pulmonary conditions and hypertension were easily the highest number of diseases reported. The researchers created an index and determined Georgia had the 31st healthiest population in the country. The healthiest states were largely along or west of the Rocky Mountains. The least healthiest states were along the Eastern Seaboard and the South. Utah was the healthiest state, and West Virginia was the least healthy state. The researchers calculated the number of lost workdays by using data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Health Interview Survey and matching all individuals who had a particular illness with the number of lost workdays in the last 12 months due to illness or injury. The next step they took was to multiply those days lost times wages per employee. Georgia’s total was 3 percent of the national cost. Georgia has about 3 percent of the nation’s population. We wondered since the study was based on 2003 figures how much the numbers have changed since then. Ross DeVol, the lead researcher, said no subsequent work had been done to determine what the total would be, but he guessed it would be greater today. ""I can say with great certainty that the number is much higher today,"" DeVol told PolitiFact Georgia via email. Another report released in May, though, found lost productivity from various health problems was much less than the Milken Institute’s estimate. The report by Gallup-Healthways calculated the total at $84 billion a year. The conditions the Gallup-Healthways study described as chronic included asthma, cancer, depression, diabetes, heart attacks, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and various physical pains. The estimated cost for each worker per day was $341. The Gallup-Healthways report based its findings on interviews with 94,000 adults nationwide who worked more than 30 hours a week, asking them how many workdays they missed each month due to poor health. Phone interviews were conducted from January through September 2012. The majority responded they missed about one day every three months. Phelan, the congressman’s spokesman, said he had not seen the Gallup-Healthways report beforehand. Phelan said he would reference the Milken report in future correspondence with constituents. ""While both studies looked at lost productivity due to illnesses and disease, the Gallup study looks at it from the perspective of 14 job types for the entire nation while the Milken study looked at it from the standpoint of the illnesses and diseases people suffer and specifically at each state, including Georgia,"" Phelan said via email. There’s little additional research on this topic. The CDC looked at the economic impact of some conditions. ""In 2009, the economic costs of cardiovascular diseases and stroke were estimated at $475.3 billion, including $313.8 billion in direct medical expenses and $161.5 billion in indirect costs ($39.1 billion in lost productivity due to sickness or disability and $122.4 billion in lost productivity due to premature death),"" the CDC found. The $122.4 billion in lost productivity is more than the Gallup-Healthways conclusion, and that estimate was for just strokes and cardiovascular diseases. A 2001 report from the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found 2.5 billion workdays were lost a year due to chronic diseases ranging from cancer to arthritis to substance abuse. To sum up, Rep. Johnson said in a letter that ""by reducing chronic health care costs in the State of Georgia, we can reduce the $32.8 billion lost each year due to lack of productivity and economic costs."" The congressman’s claim was based on accurate numbers from a Milken Institute study that appeared well-researched. We did find other research that differs from the Milken study. Johnson’s claim is based on accurate information, but there is a little context necessary to fully examine his statement.

622,27620,"Representative Mick Mulvaney, who was recently selected as the Trump administration's nominee for director of the Office of Management and Budget, one posed the question “Do we really need government-funded research at all?” on Facebook.","December 20, 2016",Mulvaney has not commented on his reason for deleting the post.,Alex Kasprak,"On 17 December 2016, President-elect Donald Trump nominated South Carolina representative Mick Mulvaney to lead the Office of Management and Budget. From the transition team statement: “We are going to do great things for the American people with Mick Mulvaney leading the Office of Management and Budget,” said President-elect Trump. “Right now we are nearly $20 trillion in debt, but Mick is a very high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nation’s finances and save our country from drowning in red ink. With Mick at the head of OMB, my administration is going to make smart choices about America’s budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer’s trust in how their money is spent.” He has been characterized by many as a “deficit hawk” and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-line fiscal conservatives. As director of the OMB, he would run an organization that, in its words: Assists the President in overseeing the preparation of the Federal budget and in supervising its administration in Federal agencies [and] also oversees and coordinates the Administration’s procurement, financial management, information, and regulatory policies. On 19 December 2016, Mother Jones’ Pema Levy reported on one of Mulvaney’s since-deleted Facebook posts, unearthed by a Democratic opposition research group named American Bridge. This post from 9 September 2016 came at a time that Congress was debating funding research into efforts to fight the spread of the Zika virus. In it, Mulvaney suggested the federal government (whose budget office he is now nominated to lead) might not be well served by funding science research at all: It has been a busy week, and with everything else going on I haven’t had a chance to post on Zika, which I know has been in the news a bit. I have received all sorts of emails and FB comments this week on Zika. Some people want me to pass a “clean” bill (which I suppose means not paying for it with spending reductions elsewhere). Other folks want us to fund more research if we can find a way to pay for it. No one has written me yet, though, to ask what might be the best question: do we really need government-funded research at all. The post, though deleted, can still be viewed on a cached version of Mulvaney’s Facebook page. His argument against science funding (and science in general) seems to follow arguments made by other prominent Trump transition team figures: because science is sometimes wrong, or not clear cut, it shouldn’t be trusted. In defense of his opposition to funding Zika research, the remainder of this 9 September 2016 post cited a recent study that cast doubt on the viruses connection to infant microcephaly: And before you inundate me with pictures of children with birth defects, consider this: Brazil’s microcephaly epidemic continues to pose a mystery — if Zika is the culprit, why are there no similar epidemics in other countries also hit hard by the virus? In Brazil, the microcephaly rate soared with more than 1,500 confirmed cases. But in Colombia, a recent study of nearly 12,000 pregnant women infected with Zika found zero microcephaly cases. If Zika is to blame for microcephaly, where are the missing cases? Perhaps there is another reason for the epidemic in Brazil. According to a new report by the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI), the number of missing cases in Colombia and elsewhere raises serious questions about the assumed connection between Zika and microcephaly. That isn’t from some politicians website or some right-wing advocacy group. The information to which Mulvaney is referring comes from a press release provided by the New England Complex Systems Institute, and posted on the science news aggregator ScienceDaily.com on 24 June 2016. The findings that Mulvaney cites to are summarized in that release: In Brazil, the microcephaly rate soared with more than 1,500 confirmed cases. But in Colombia, a recent study of nearly 12,000 pregnant women infected with Zika found zero microcephaly cases. If Zika is to blame for microcephaly, where are the missing cases? In the final portion of Mulvaney’s post, he incorrectly asserts that this scientific information came from the New England Journal of Medicine because the press release cited a study from that journal. The NEJM study cited in the release — a review of data from Brazil’s Zika epidemic — concluded the exact opposite: On the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. And, as it turns out, so did the New England Complex Systems Institute. A closer look at the actual reports reveals that the NECSI had been releasing semi-monthly reports on Zika in Colombia since May 2016. Early on, they found no evidence to support a connection between the virus and microcephaly. Later data, however, revealed that more time was needed to see the effects of the virus in children born to Zika infected mothers. In their August report (the final one in this series), they stated: The epidemic of Zika in Colombia was expected to result in many cases of microcephaly. However, until epidemiological week 23 (June 11) there were only 6 reported cases. The number of cases increased to 21 in weeks 24-27, which appears to confirm expectations about Zika as a cause of microcephaly […]",true,"Politics, research, science, trump administration"
623,2835,Smoking to kill 5.6 million US kids if not stubbed out: report.,"January 17, 2014","Another 5.6 million American children may die prematurely unless smoking rates fall in the United States, according to a report by the U.S. surgeon general which links a range of new illnesses to the habit.","Julie Steenhuysen, Susan Heavey","Fifty years after the first surgeon general’s report declared smoking a hazard to human health, the new study adds conditions ranging from colon cancer to diabetes and arthritis to the tally of tobacco-related diseases. The report, the first in more than a decade, found that smoking has killed more than 20 million Americans prematurely in the last half century. Although adult smoking rates have fallen to the current 18 percent from 43 percent of Americans in 1965, each day, more than 3,200 youths under the age 18 try their first cigarette, according to the report published on Friday. “Enough is enough,” acting Surgeon General Dr Boris Lushniak said in a telephone interview. “We need to eliminate the use of cigarettes and create a tobacco-free generation.”  Federal health officials are calling on businesses, state and local governments, and society as a whole, to end smoking within a generation through hard-hitting media campaigns, smoke-free air policies, tobacco taxes, unhindered access to cessation treatment and more spending by state and local governments on tobacco control. “It’s not just the federal lead on this anymore,” said Lushniak. “To get this done, we have to go to industry. We have to go to healthcare providers and remind them that this problem is not yet solved.”  The report, dubbed The Health Consequences of Smoking, 50 Years of Progress, details the growing science showing the diseases and health conditions caused by smoking since Dr Luther Terry issued the landmark report on January 11, 1964, that first confirmed smoking tobacco caused lung cancer. In that first report, only lung cancer was associated with smoking. Now there are 13. “We’re still a country very much addicted to tobacco,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said at a White House event to mark the anniversary. The new report adds liver and colorectal cancer to that list, but it also details several other conditions caused by smoking, including diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and impaired immune function, and cleft palate in infants. And in a startling statistic, the report found that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of stroke by 20 to 30 percent. “It really is astonishing that even 50 years in, we are finding new ways that tobacco maims and kills people,” Dr Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a telephone interview. He said the report found that smoking costs the nation $130 billion in direct medical expenses each year. Frieden reiterated that tobacco control efforts have saved as many as 8 million lives in the past five decades, but stressed that much more needs to be done to eliminate smoking, which remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. At the White House, officials pointed squarely at the tobacco industry continued efforts to promote their products. “This is not an accident,” Assistant Health Secretary Howard Koh said. “These deaths do not occur just by chance. Each year, the tobacco industry spends $8 billion - nearly $1 million an hour - to advertise and market cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products.”  As a result, Lushniak urged public health officials to take tougher action to curb tobacco use: “It’s all about getting more aggressive than we have been.”  Officials called on states to increase their investment in smoking prevention. CDC’s Frieden said states get $80 per capita from tobacco companies related to a major legal settlement in 1998, in which big tobacco makers agreed to pay $206 billion to 46 states to help pay the costs of treating ailing smokers. Although CDC recommends that states spend at least $12 per person on tobacco control, states “actually only spend about $1.50, and it’s been decreasing in recent years,” he said. Harold Wimmer, president and chief executive of the American Lung Association, said the new report, coming on the heels of the 50th anniversary of the landmark 1964 report, present an opportunity for renewed political commitment to ending the tobacco epidemic. On Wednesday, his group will release its own report grading state and federal efforts to control tobacco. “Only a recommitment to a heightened level of action will enable us to finish the job,” Wimmer said. Last week, the group and other advocacy organizations called on political leaders to commit to cutting smoking rates to less than 10 percent of the population in a decade and to protect all Americans from secondhand smoke within five years. Friday’s report briefly touched on the increasingly controversial topic of electronic or e-cigarettes - devices designed to deliver nicotine through vapor instead of tobacco smoke. It noted that major tobacco companies, including Altria Group Inc, best known for its Marlboro brand; Reynolds American Inc, maker of Camel cigarettes; and Lorillard Inc, maker of Newport cigarettes, have invested in the products. Previous studies have suggested that people can use the devices as smoking cessation tools, but some public health advocates worry that e-cigarettes might introduce more people to nicotine, the addicting chemical found in tobacco. Electronic devices that feature fruit and candy flavors are even more worrying, critics say, because they could introduce children to smoking. And there are still questions about the safety of the vapors released by the devices. Health groups and state attorneys general have been pressuring the FDA to impose regulations on the devices. CDC’s Frieden urged caution as the industry comes up with various new products given the known dangers about tobacco. “If we’re talking about tobacco products ... they are guilty until proven innocent, not the other way around,” he said at the White House. “All of these products may have an positive role is appropriately regulated but not in the way that they are being sold now with widespread marketing, over the Internet, with bubble gum and cotton candy flavors, with free samples.”  Altria said in a statement that it supports the FDA’s authority to regulate e-cigarettes as an extension of its power to regulate tobacco. “Our tobacco companies continue to focus on developing lower-risk products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers and see this as an important business opportunity under FDA regulation,” the company added.",true,Health News

From this might he have experienced cronovision and then later invent the Cronovisor?On the meme, text read:Nikola Tesla Describing a Cell Phone in 1926“When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles, and the instruments through which we shall be able to do all of this, will fit in our vest pockets.” Nikola Tesla, 1926September 2019 did not mark the first appearance of the quote on Imgur or Reddit; in May 2015, it was submitted in text format to r/quotes:""When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain…"" – Nikola Tesla, 1926 from quotesTesla did not, however, seem to predict that these wondrous and miraculous vest-pocket devices would also be almost instantly blamed for distracting the whole of humanity from staring at one another on train cars or looking out windows. (Tesla also didn’t appear to know that vests or waistcoats would fall to the wayside in favor of hoodies. )Elements of Tesla’s purported prognostication were poetic and subjective, describing the interconnected future world as a “whole earth … converted into a huge brain” and “all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole.” That portion of the quote wouldn’t immediately be recognized by most readers as a prediction of cellular phones, but the preceding comments did sound reasonably well-guessed nearly a hundred years later.By way of context, telephones had been around for nearly half a century in 1926, the year Tesla made his purported phone prediction:In 1877-78, the first telephone line was constructed, the first switchboard was created and the first telephone exchange was in operation. Three years later, almost 49,000 telephones were in use. In 1880, Bell merged this company with others to form the American Bell Telephone Company and in 1885 American Telegraph and Telephone Company (AT&T) was formed; it dominated telephone communications for the next century. At one point in time, Bell System employees purposely denigrated the U.S. telephone system to drive down stock prices of all phone companies and thus make it easier for Bell to acquire smaller competitors.By 1900 there were nearly 600,000 phones in Bell’s telephone system; that number shot up to 2.2 million phones by 1905, and 5.8 million by 1910. In 1915 the transcontinental telephone line began operating. By 1907, AT&T had a near monopoly on phone and telegraph service, thanks to its purchase of Western Union. Its president, Theodore Vail, urged at the time that a monopoly could most efficiently operate the nation’s far-flung communications network. At the urging of the public and AT&T competitors, the government began to investigate the company for anti-trust violations, thus forcing the 1913 Kingsbury Commitment, an agreement between AT&T vice president Nathan Kingsbury and the office of the U.S. Attorney General. Under this commitment, AT&T agreed to divest itself of Western Union and provide long-distance services to independent phone exchanges.In 1891, thirty years prior, an AT&T wrote (albeit less lyrically):A system of telephony without wires seems one of the interesting possibilities, and the distance on the earth through which it is possible to speak is theoretically limited only by the curvation of the earth.In that context, not only had telephones been around for almost fifty years by then, but speculation they one day might lack wires took place three decades before, too. And in 1901, Guglielmo Marconi transmitted the first transatlantic wireless telegraph. In fact, Marconi and Tesla scuffled over who did what first:In 1909 Marconi shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with the German physicist Karl F. Braun, the inventor of the cathode ray tube. Marconi’s accolades were not without controversy: many other men had claims (some dubious, some not) to the “Father of Radio” title. As early as 1895, the Russian physicist Alexander Popov was broadcasting between buildings, while in India Jagdish Chandra Bose was using radio waves to ring bells and trigger explosions. In 1901 the Serbian-American electrical pioneer Nikola Tesla said he had developed a wireless telegraph in 1893; in 1943 the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated four Marconi radio patents, citing Tesla’s prior work.Articles about the Tesla quote appeared in July and January 2015. The latter piece mentioned that Tesla further seemed to fret over the “awakening of the intellect of women,” and he surmised:… Woman will ignore precedent and startle civilization with their progress.The acquisition of new fields of endeavor by women, their gradual usurpation of leadership, will dull and finally dissipate feminine sensibilities, will choke the maternal instinct, so that marriage and motherhood may become abhorrent and human civilization draw closer and closer to the perfect civilization of the bee.A citation for the original quote appeared in multiple places, including Tesla’s Wikiquote page. The quote appeared in the 1964 book Lightning in His Hand: The Life Story of Nikola Tesla, on pages 176 and 177.The publication in which it appeared was Colliers, and the piece (“When Woman is Boss,” an interview with Nikola Tesla by John B. Kennedy) was dated January 30 1926. The relevant portion appeared relatively early on in the interview, and included additional commentary about wireless technology:AT SIXTY-EIGHT years of age Nikola Tesla sits quietly in his study, reviewing the world that he has helped to change, foreseeing other changes that must come in the onward stride of the human race. He is a tall, thin, ascetic man who wears somber clothes and looks out at life with steady, deep-set eyes. In the midst of luxury he lives meagerly, selecting his diet with a precision almost extreme. He abstains from all beverages save water and milk and has never indulged in tobacco since early manhood.He is an engineer, an inventor and, above these as well as basic to them, a philosopher. And, despite his obsession with the practical application of what a gifted mind may learn in books, he has never removed his gaze from the drama of life.This world, amazed many times during the last throbbing century, will rub its eyes and stand breathless before greater wonders than even the past few generations have seen; and fifty years from now the world will differ more from the present-day than our world now differs from the world of fifty years ago.Nikola Tesla came to America in early manhood, and his inventive genius found quick recognition. When fortune was his through his revolutionary power-transmission machines he established plants, first in New York, then Colorado, later on Long Island, where his innumerable experiments resulted in all manner of important and minor advances in electrical science. Lord Kelvin said of him (before he was forty) that he had contributed more than any other man to the study of electricity.“From the inception of the wireless system,” he says, “I saw that this new art of applied electricity would be of greater benefit to the human race than any other scientific discovery, for it virtually eliminates distance. The majority of the ills from which humanity suffers are due to the immense extent of the terrestrial globe and the inability of individuals and nations to come into close contact.“Wireless will achieve the closer contact through transmission of intelligence, transport of our bodies and materials and conveyance of energy.“When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do his will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket.“We shall be able to witness and hear events–the inauguration of a President, the playing of a world series game, the havoc of an earthquake or the terror of a battle–just as though we were present.“When the wireless transmission of power is made commercial, transport and transmission will be revolutionized. Already motion pictures have been transmitted by wireless over a short distance. Later the distance will be illimitable, and by later I mean only a few years hence. Pictures are transmitted over wires — they were telegraphed successfully through the point system thirty years ago. When wireless transmission of power becomes general, these methods will be as crude as is the steam locomotive compared with the electric train.”A meme with a vivid description of cell phones credited to Nikola Tesla in 1926 is correctly attributed. Tesla made the remarks among several in a January 1926 Collier’s interview with John B. Kennedy. Tesla is historically remembered for, among other things, detailed prognostications about the future of technology. However, some wireless advances existed in 1926, and Tesla was not the only person predicting “telephony without wires” in general.",true,"Fact Checks, Viral Content"

There is a shred of truth to this claim but not much beyond that.",Katie Sanders,"Find a goofy still frame of television, and people will propel it across the Internet. CNN got a taste of this law of social media on Wednesday after airing a silly-looking graphic about a serious topic: the Islamic State’s recruitment of female fighters. The anchor’s set-up of the segment did little to help viewers take it seriously. ""ISIS is talking online about jars of Nutella, pictures of kittens and emojis,"" CNN Newsroom host Carol Costello said in the Feb. 18, 2015, segment. ""These three images are in part helping ISIS recruiters lure westerners into their fight because they want people to believe their life on the battlefield isn't so different than yours. They actually eat Nutella, and I guess they have pet kittens."" As she spoke, a highly sharable graphic depicting a jar of the chocolate hazelnut spread, two orange tabby kittens and a silly face from the emoji keyboard appeared with script (a chyron in TV talk) that said ""ISIS LURES WOMEN WITH KITTENS, NUTELLA"". Costello went on to interview Nimmi Gowrinathan, an academic who studies women in crisis and a visiting professor at the Colin Powell Center for Civic and Global Leadership at City College, New York. The words ""Nutella,"" ""kittens"" or ""emoji"" were not part of their discussion. Instead Gowrinathan talked about how the discussion of female Islamic State fighters (also called ISIS or ISIL) should focus on the larger political suppression that pushes women to join these kind of movements rather than looking at what may have triggered one woman’s turning point to extremism. But her more nuanced discussion wasn’t the takeaway. Instead the blogosphere ranks of Jezebel, New York Magazine’s Daily Intel, and, most angrily, Vox dinged CNN for suggesting women could be easily ""lured"" into ISIS with guilty, silly pleasures. As fact-checkers, we felt beckoned to sort out the confusion. Was CNN’s segment just plain weird or onto something? CNN did not return emails and calls for comment. We went to experts who track jihadist groups, including ISIS, on social media. ""The way that the CNN story was framed was kind of funny and eyeroll-inducing,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, ""but it’s largely correct."" The online prowess of the Islamic State is a well-documented strength of the movement. From videos to online forums to journals to various social media websites, supporters disseminate propaganda messages (90,000 a day) that are more slickly produced and reach wider audiences than efforts from other terrorist groups (think of al-Qaida home videos showing Osama bin Laden speaking into the camera with little other detail). ISIS even has plans for a 24-hour propaganda network, said Daniel Cohen, a research fellow and coordinator of the cyber security program at Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies. The videos or posts are often translated into multiple languages so that demographic groups can be more effectively targeted around the world. Some of the imagery depicts a fulfilling life in a dream state ruled by sharia law, where kids are cheerful and ISIS recruits offer humanitarian aid in war zones. And yes, the group’s supporters also speak in emojis, tweet pictures of themselves unwinding with Nutella and run Twitter accounts like @ISILCats showing jihadists cuddling with kittens and kittens cuddling with firearms. It’s all part of an effort to speak the same cultural language as potential recruits so that they don’t think life with the Islamic State is all beheadings and burnings, Cohen said. ""Most of the people sharing this content on social media came from Western culture,"" Cohen said. It makes them seem relatable and charismatic, said Gartenstein-Ross, adding that it’s nothing new for ISIS. Richard Brennan, a Middle East expert at the RAND Institute, said the ISIS campaign ""is much more sophisticated"" than what was portrayed on CNN. ""It’s targeting the young men and women who want to be part of something greater than themselves to accept this movement for the validity that they believe the Koran is teaching,"" he said. Obviously, not all of the tweets, videos and images are cheery (the beheadings of prisoners, for instance). Other viral memes are designed to show how ""disgusting"" their enemies are by showing dead children’s bodies from bombs or airstrikes. The point is, the use of familiar western imagery in social media messages is just one tool in the Islamic State’s vast marketing toolbox, and the real motivations for someone joining the fight run much deeper. Those motivations are connected to the pursuit of identity and purpose. Some of the women recruited by ISIS act as internal police within their territories to make sure people are adhering to sharia law and stopping women who are not dressed appropriately, Cohen said. They also play a big role in online recruitment efforts. In an August article for Foreign Affairs, Gowrinathan criticized experts for being so perplexed by the formation of all-women brigades within ISIS. Women in war zones, she wrote, typically don’t have a role in the politics of their society and are drawn to extremism when they cannot air their grievances in the open. Still, some are coerced into joining and do so for their own safety. The audience for the communications with kittens and Nutella is a slim component of the majority of Sunni Islamic women who are joining ISIS from countries around the region out of oppression in their home state, she said in an interview with PunditFact. And even for the westerners, a life promising time with cute kitties and tasty sweets ""won’t ever be enough of an effective recruitment tool for any group."" ""The kittens and emoticon thing is most damaging because it denies women any political agency,"" she said. ""It infantilizes them in a way that you would assume they would be drawn to this for the most superficial reasons."" For the record, Gowrinathan said she wasn’t brought on CNN to talk nutella and cats, nor was she pleased with the attention CNN producers brought to the popular hazelnut spread, winky faces and baby cats. ""All I tried to point out is we dismiss women’s politics all the time,"" Gowrinathan said. Costello eventually deleted a tweet (which we captured below) promoting the segment with a video of the interview. And Gowrinathan tweeted that she did not, for the record, believe ""emoticons are relevant in recruitment of #women to #isis."" Our ruling This fact-check is a case study of what can go wrong when a news channel sacrifices nuance for an eye-catching graphic. On CNN, that graphic said, ""ISIS LURES WOMEN WITH KITTENS, NUTELLA.""

628,9766,"More People Should Get Statins, Report Says","July 17, 2015","We always cheer when we see a story take the rare step of spelling out the costs of a treatment as clearly as this one did. We also love the use of hard numbers in talking about the potential benefits of wider statin use and the space devoted to risks, especially in a short story. The NBC coverage was focused on a cost-effectiveness study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. A competing story in the New York Times brought in another study, also focused on the new statin guidelines, and used the occasion to do something that this story didn’t quite accomplish: provide a detailed explanation of the quality of the evidence supporting wider statin use. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the USA. The percentage of adults who might be recommended for statins is quite high, and so the costs and effectiveness of these drugs are vitally important to understand both at an individual level and across the population.","William Heisel,Doug Campos-Outcalt, MD, MPA,Kevin Lomangino","While the New York Times skipped the cost question, NBC gave readers the numbers they needed to know. It said that “Statins, which include Lipitor, Mevacor, Crestor and Zocor, are extremely popular. They’re prescribed to about 15 percent of U.S. adults, at a cost ranging from about $4 a month for the cheapest generic version to $600 for a pricey name-brand.” That’s a huge cost range and, multiplied out for the millions more Americans who are being encouraged to take statins, represents a significant potential increase in health care spending. To inform readers even more fully, the story could have looked at what those global costs would add up to for the entire country. It also could have explained what researchers mean when they say that the drugs are “worth it” and how the value of treatment was calculated in the study. The story did quantify benefits using absolute numbers when describing the potential impact on heart attacks from wider statin use. The story said that “if even more people were given statins — if they were given to people with a 3 percent risk of developing heart disease over 10 years — another 160,000 heart attacks and strokes would be prevented, they estimated.” We thought the Times, though, did a better job overall providing context for those numbers. NBC did a better job than the Times in answering the question about risks. NBC wrote that statins “can damage muscle in 5 to 15 percent of patients. In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration updated labeling on statins to include warnings about confusion and memory loss, elevated blood sugar leading to Type 2 diabetes, and muscle weakness.” This is a nice addition to the overall coverage of the new statin studies and a step we wish more reporters had taken. Other than noting that the study was published in a journal, there is no examination of the quality of the evidence. The Times did a better job in this regard, mentioning that the study wasn’t a clinical trial and that the prospective Framingham cohort is almost all white. There is no disease mongering in the story. We were surprised that there were no independent sources quoted in the story. There are a lot of people talking about these studies, and the Times did a better job seeking out independent analysis. The story did not address alternatives to statin treatment such as diet and exercise. The story made it clear that statins are widely available. They are also paid for by insurance plans. The story mentions that the new report addresses concerns about guidelines issued in 2013, so in that sense it provides enough context for a Satisfactory rating. But we’d note that the story gives the impression that this study’s findings are the definitive word on whether otherwise healthy people should start taking statins. But, as the competing New York Times story notes, there is still serious debate about how important these new findings are. The story does not rely excessively on a news release.",true,"cholesterol,statins"
629,8945,"Can't exercise? A hot bath may help improve inflammation, metabolism, study suggests","November 19, 2018","Take a look at the headline and subheading of this news release, because the former is very misleading, and the latter comes closer to the truth: Headline: ‘Can’t exercise? A hot bath may help improve inflammation, metabolism, study suggest’ Sub-head: ‘Hot-water immersion improved inflammatory markers and blood sugar in overweight men’ The subheading is a fairly good summary of the study. But the “Can’t exercise? …” headline promises much more than this small study can support. The research question? How does hot water immersion —  that is, ten 1-hour soaks at 102ºF over two weeks  — affect metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers in the blood of 10 overweight and sedentary men. The answer? Some mild, transient changes were noted that could theoretically be beneficial. Just because exercise has been shown to transiently increase inflammatory markers and decrease blood sugar, and hot water immersion does the same thing, doesn’t mean that the latter might substitute for the former. Furthermore, the research into the relationship between inflammation and sugar/insulin levels is mostly in rodents, and extrapolating these benefits to humans is unrealistic. Yes, exercise can temporarily trigger an anti-inflammatory response at the molecular level, as well as decrease sugar/insulin levels. This study suggests repeated, lengthy hot water immersion can do the same thing in 10 overweight men. But that hardly means the two interventions are comparable in any way, or that these blood changes have any meaningful or sustainable clinical benefits.","Michael Joyce, MD,Edward Ward, MD,Kathlyn Stone","Cost isn’t really applicable here;  but it’s important to point out that probably the best way to access a hot water source that consistently stays around 102ºF would be a hot tub, and that would involve cost for most people. This is a major weakness of the release. We’re told that hot water immersion (60 minutes, daily at 102ºF) elevated levels of: This is nebulous, if not unhelpful language, that suggests (unquantified) benefits that are hard to make sense of. Furthermore, it’s mentioned 10 soaks over 14 days led to: “a reduction of fasting blood sugar and insulin levels as well as improved low-grade inflammation at rest.” Both diabetics and non-diabetics alike would appropriately ask, “really? By how much? For how long?” But that information is not provided. Nor is any context provided for readers wondering how changes in metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers translate into noticeable or measurable clinical effects that matter to them. Harms are not mentioned. Anyone who owns a hot tub, or uses a public bath, is likely familiar with warnings regarding who might want to consult their physician before using one. Prolonged exposure to hot water can lead to increased heart rate, decreased blood pressure, and dehydration … all of which may be ill-advised for some heart patients and pregnant women. The study was extremely small (10 volunteers), short (2 weeks), and because the subjects were only men who were obese or inactive, probably not applicable to the general public. This wasn’t mentioned. Nor is it mentioned that most of the existing research on the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and glucose/insulin levels — which is strongly touted in this release — is based on animal models. That should have been clarified since the headline of this news release suggests human benefits. That’s speculative at best, and at worst misleading. No overt disease mongering but there’s an inappropriate and baseless implication that those who are unable to exercise — or are obese or sedentary — have problems with blood sugar or ‘inflammation’; and that those two problems are likely related. That’s just not the case and misleading enough to warrant an unsatisfactory rating here. Funding is not mentioned. A review of the published article doesn’t suggest conflicts of interest among the researchers. Alternatives to what? If the gist of this release is that overweight and sedentary men can’t exercise (and hot water immersion might be a good replacement), then this news release never should have been published because the premise and conclusion are both erroneous. But if the gist is that there ARE people — such as those who are frail, disabled, or paralyzed — who might benefit from an intervention that offers the benefits from exercise they can’t do, then this news release is misleading. Because all this study shows is that hot water immersion changes some metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers. Yes, exercise can do that too, but the real benefits and sustainability of these blood changes remain unproven. Not applicable … see “Costs” above. The exact results of this small human study are new but many researchers have been working on theories and rodent studies regarding heat therapy and chronic inflammatory diseases. Much of this was summarized by Ely et al in 2017 in the journal Temperature, “Meta-inflammation and cardiometabolic disease in obesity: Can heat therapy help?“ The headline is both unjustified and inappropriate. First of all, most people don’t bathe for one-hour straight in a bath locked in at 102º F. Second, a study of 10 men over 2 weeks can’t draw any conclusions regarding inflammation and metabolism. Finally,  what’s inappropriate here is that there are plenty of people physically incapable of conventional exercise; why lead with the enticement of “Can’t exercise?” when the referenced study offers no proof that the hot water immersion offers the benefits of exercise?",false,"American Physiological Society,hot baths,obesity"

Earlier this month, J&J recalled around 33,000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after the FDA found trace amounts of asbestos in samples taken from a bottle purchased online. “Rigorous and third-party testing confirms there is no asbestos in Johnson’s Baby Powder. We stand by the safety of our product,” J&J said in a statement. The company did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on the FDA standing by its test result. The different test outcomes could have resulted from the fact that contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and there is no standard test for asbestos in talc, FDA officials said.

631,21150,A state bill would end a longstanding requirement that local governments repair highways and sidewalks -- and block injured citizens from suing over neglected maintenance.,"November 4, 2011",Wisconsin Association for Justice says a state bill would end a requirement that local governments repair roads and prevent injured citizens from suing,Dave Umhoefer,"As the 2011 Wisconsin Legislature neared completion of its work, a group of trial lawyers attacked a batch of Republican-sponsored legislation it contends will ""erase basic rights."" The Wisconsin Association for Justice -- formerly the Wisconsin Academy of Trial Lawyers -- railed against limits on attorneys fees in consumer cases, and immunity for doctors and drug makers in injury cases. We previously ruled this rating for a health care advocate's claim that one of the bills ""grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity from injuries and deaths caused by their products."" This time we’ll examine the trial lawyers’ claim in an Oct. 31, 2011, news release regarding Senate Bill 125/Assembly Bill 180. The group said the proposal ""makes local governments' repair of roads, bridges and sidewalks no longer required by state law, and injured citizens could no longer sue them for bodily or auto damages … The state law has been in place for 162 years."" That sounds like a major change of lanes. Let’s pop the hood. First, a bit of history. Over several decades, it’s become much tougher for citizens in Wisconsin to sue and win when claiming negligence by their local units of government. How much tougher? In a 2009 Wisconsin Supreme Court opinion, Justice David Prosser, a former Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, said that ""so far as government responsibility for torts is concerned, immunity has become the rule and liability has become the rare exception."" ""Justice,"" wrote Prosser, ""has been confined to a crawl space too narrow for most tort victims to fit."" Generally speaking, except in cases involving unheeded warnings over dangers involving actions they absolutely should have taken, public agencies are shielded from liability. That’s because of state laws and court rulings. A notable and longstanding exception to that -- under a state ""highway defects"" law dating to 1849, a year after statehood -- allows up to $50,000 in civil damages when highways and sidewalks are poorly maintained and lead to vehicle damage or bodily injury. The bill up for debate would eliminate nearly all of that statute. Local governments have sought this for years, hoping to avoid what they see as the ""automatic"" liability for defects, and get more discretion over when and how to do highway repairs -- as state officials have. Former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle vetoed a previous attempt. Here’s what’s unique about the defective highways statute (893.83): Plaintiffs don’t have to clear the high legal bar they would in winning a case against the government over other mistakes. They don’t have to show government had an absolute duty to do the specific thing in dispute -- that duty is presumed under that existing law. Notably, the law creates a ""right to recover"" damages from government. Many of the cases are routinely settled before getting to court -- that’s how strong the law is. If the cases reach trial, jurors have to decide if damages stemmed from known road defects -- and whether the municipality kept the highway ""reasonably safe for public travel,"" according to jury instructions in place since 1974. ""With winter conditions, it’s awfully difficult to make sure highways are maintained every second, every hour of every day,"" said Andrew Phillips, a lawyer representing the Wisconsin Counties Association. Counties do most of the highway work. He’s talking about potholes and defective shoulders, among other things -- problems that have been litigated all the way to the state’s highest courts. The money stakes are not sky high, but significant: over a decade, counties served by Wisconsin County Mutual Insurance paid out $950,000 in these cases. That doesn’t include all counties, or other municipalities. Let’s turn back to the statement. Asked about its claims, the Association for Justice pointed us to the text of the bill. The bill would eliminate the liability provisions except for damages resulting from the accumulation of snow or ice that has existed on a highway for at least three weeks. The chief backers of the bill, the Wisconsin Counties Association, acknowledge that. So would that mean citizens could ""no longer sue"" and locals would not have a duty to repair, as the association claimed? They couldn’t sue under the highway defects statute -- but still could file a claim under a more general state law, according to Phillips, the lawyer for the counties group. Even Ann Jacobs, a personal injury lawyer speaking for the Association for Justice -- the group making the claim -- agreed. The two sides also agree localities’ legal exposure would drop if the more general state law (893.80) was the only route for plaintiffs. The bottom line: People could still sue, though under less favorable circumstances from the complainant’s viewpoint. The ultimate effect would be decided by judges. What about the second part of the claim? Would the bill eliminate the requirement that local governments repair roads? Jacobs, of the trial lawyers’ group, says it effectively does because enforcement of that duty would all but disappear without the specific liability statute. ""What good is a right without a remedy?"" Jacobs asked. Even the counties’ attorney, Phillips, acknowledges that county decisions on when and how to repair highways would be more discretionary with the strict liability gone. The Association for Justice, at a public hearing on the bill, made that point using this language: ""Local governments would not have a general duty to maintain highways and bridges"" if the bill passed. But in its public news release, the group’s claim went well past that -- leaving readers to believe road repairs would no longer be required. Phillips pointed us to Chapter 83.025 of state statutes: ""The county trunk system shall be marked and maintained by the county."" And for towns, 82.03: ""The town board shall have the care and supervision of all highways under the town's jurisdiction."" So the locals still would have the obligation to repair. Let’s patch this up and move on. A trial lawyers group contends that a bill would change a 162-year-old state law to ""make local governments' repair of roads, bridges and sidewalks no longer required by state law."" It continued: ""Injured citizens could no longer sue them for bodily or auto damages."" The bill could have a big impact on local government liability for highway problems, though just how dramatic remains to be seen. But the group’s news release went too far in flatly claiming citizens could no longer sue, and asserting that highway repairs would no longer be required.

633,23093,"As CEO of WWE, Linda McMahon ""was caught tipping off a ringside physician"" about a federal investigation into illegally distributing steroids to wrestlers.","October 27, 2010",DSCC claims Linda McMahon tipped off ringside physician about steroids investigation,Robert Farley,"U.S. Senate candidate Linda McMahon's experience as co-founder, along with her husband Vince, of World Wrestling Entertainment has proved to be a double-edged sword on the campaign trail in Connecticut. While McMahon often touts her experience running the pro wrestling empire to boost her real-world business cred, it also has left her open to accusations that the WWE uses sexist story lines and that there is rampant steroid abuse by some wrestlers. In the final week of the race -- which pits Republican McMahon against Democrat Richard Blumenthal -- the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has begun airing an attack ad that attempts to body-slam McMahon for tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into the illegal distribution of steroids to some of the WWE's wrestlers. ""Read this,"" a female narrator begins, as a legal document scrolls in the background. ""It's a memo Linda McMahon wrote. Evidence in a federal trial against her company. McMahon was caught tipping off a ringside physician who was later accused of hiding evidence. It didn't work. McMahon's ringside doctor was convicted of illegally distributing steroids to her workers. That's Linda McMahon. A bad CEO. A worse senator."" The memo in question -- marked ""CONFIDENTIAL INTEROFFICE MEMO"" -- was sent on Dec. 1, 1989, by Linda McMahon to Pat Patterson, a fellow executive at Titan Sports, the parent company of what was then the World Wrestling Federation. It became part of the public record as an exhibit in a steroids-related case against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports in the early 1990s. But the story actually goes back a little further, to an investigation into ringside doctor George T. Zahorian for distributing steroids to some of the WWF's wrestlers. As the 1989 memo from Linda McMahon explains, a government official let slip at a fundraising event that ""the State of Pennsylvania is probably going to launch an investigation into the use of all illegal drugs including steroids."" ""In addition,"" McMahon wrote, ""this fellow mentioned that he was aware of Dr. Zahorian and his relationship with WWF."" Zahorian was actually assigned throughout the 1980s to attend WWF exhibitions in Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission. But following deregulation in 1989, promoters like the WWF were required to hire their own licensed physicians to be present at events. Zahorian was scheduled to be the doctor on hand at an upcoming event in Hershey, Pa., but Linda McMahon's memo makes clear the WWF wanted to distance itself from him. ""Although you and I discussed before about continuing to have Zahorian at our events as the doctor on call, I think that is now not a good idea,"" McMahon wrote in the memo. ""Vince agreed, and would like for you to call Zahorian and tell him not to come to any more of our events and to also clue him in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking."" It's that last part, telling Patterson to ""clue him in"" about a possible steroids investigation, that forms the basis for the claim in the campaign ad. In 1991, Zahorian was charged with distributing steroids to a number of WWF wrestlers (none of whom were charged because, at the time, it was not a federal crime to use steroids, only to distribute them). He was convicted and sentenced to three years in federal prison. But that wasn't the end of the matter. In the wake of the Zahorian indictment, federal investigators opened a wide-reaching steroids investigation into the WWF. And in 1992, the government filed an indictment against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports, alleging they conspired to ""unlawfully provide WWF wrestling performers with steroids to enhance their size and musculature, and thereby to increase the ticket sales for WWF exhibitions and the profits to Titan and McMahon."" In its indictment, prosecutors alleged Titan officials learned of a federal investigation into Zahorian's activities and warned him about it. Linda McMahon's memo was entered in the case as Exhibit #2. According to the indictment, shortly after the memo was sent, ""a Titan executive known to the Grand Jury had a telephone conversation with Zahorian and directed him to destroy any records of Zahorian's contact with WWF or WWF wrestling personnel."" It was later learned from one of Zahorian's attorneys that after Zahorian got the phone call warning him about the investigation, he shipped files on wrestlers to his attorney's office (so they were not part of the evidence seized when investigators raided his office). But according to longtime WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt, the files were never destroyed and were later made available to prosecutors. ""Dr. Zahorian didn't destroy anything,"" McDevitt said. ""It was all given to the government."" In any event, the government's case against Titan and Vince McMahon failed miserably. Several counts were tossed before the case even went to the jury -- including two counts alleging that Vince McMahon and the company distributed steroids to wrestlers such as Terry Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan), because the judge said prosecutors failed to establish that the alleged conspiracy occurred in the jurisdiction of the New York court where the case was filed. And on the one remaining count, that they had distributed mislabeled anabolic steroids, both Vince McMahon and the company were acquitted. In other words, none of the charges ever stuck. In an extensive story about the issue in Connecticut's The Day, reporter Ted Mann asked McMahon about the memo. ""I don't pretend to remember to go back, to revisit all the aspects of that case,"" McMahon told The Day. ""It has been tried, acquitted and done with, and WWE has evolved its total health and wellness policy over the years, and I'm sure will continue to evolve."" According to the story:  When asked if her decision to notify Zahorian had led him to destroy records that might have more thoroughly documented his sale of steroids to WWF wrestlers — as prosecutors in 1994 alleged — McMahon's reply was curt. ""I can't speak to any of that,' she said. ""I have no idea."" WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt said he believes the DSCC ad is misleading, because it suggests by innuendo that Linda McMahon sought to obstruct the government's investigation. ""There were never any charges against Linda McMahon of any kind,"" McDevitt said. ""There was never any charge of obstruction of justice against anybody."" An indictment is nothing more than an allegation, McDevitt said, and the case ended without a conviction against anyone on anything. ""You can only gain an acquittal in this country,"" McDevitt said. ""That's all you can do."" Everyone agrees Linda McMahon was never charged with or convicted of anything, including obstruction of justice. But the ad from the DSCC doesn't say she was. The ad accuses McMahon of tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into distributing steroids to their wrestlers. How else could one interpret Linda McMahon's direction in the 1989 memo ""to also clue him (Zahorian) in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking."" It's also  that a government indictment later alleged that, after getting a call from a Titan employee tipping him off to the investigation, Zahorian tried to hide evidence at his attorney's office. But whether Zahhorian tried to ""hide"" evidence may or may not be . Zahorian sent files to his attorney, but they were not destroyed, and according to WWE's attorney, they were later made available to investigators. Nothing in Linda McMahon's memo suggests she directed the employee to tell Zahorian to hide or destroy evidence. But again, the ad doesn't say she did. The ad merely says she tipped off the ringside physician about an investigation. She did, according to her own memo. And Zahorian was later convicted of distributing steroids to some of her WWF wrestlers.

634,8950,Distinguishing fatal prostate cancer from 'manageable' cancer now possible,"October 22, 2018","A news release from the University of York describes a new test that uses computer algorithms and genetic markers to distinguish between aggressive and more manageable types of prostate cancer. While the study is informative, the news release summarizes it in confusing terms and analogies that may be difficult for a lay reader to understand. Furthermore, it neglects to mention until the very end of the release that this test has only been done in the laboratory, and is likely still years away from being available to actual patients. Prostate cancer is relatively common. According to the American Cancer Society, 1 in 9 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lives. It is also the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. Some prostate cancers are more aggressive than others, however. A test that could distinguish between aggressive and more manageable cancer types could help some patients avoid unnecessary and risky radiotherapy and surgery. An estimated 40% of prostate cancers detected by the standard PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test are considered over-diagnosed. For decades, the great majority of these men were aggressively over-treated with surgery or radiation. In recent years, more men with low-risk cancers are opting for active surveillance, a monitoring strategy that involves repeated PSA tests and biopsies. Only men with evidence of cancer progression will be offered curative treatment. However, the current methods for determining low-risk status — PSA and Gleason score — are considered relatively crude. A more accurate test would not only help limit over treatment but would potentially give men more confidence in selecting active surveillance.","Leah Rosenbaum,Richard Hoffman, MD,Kathlyn Stone","This news release does not mention costs. This is likely because, as we said above, the test is still experimental, and not something available to the general public. In comparison, available genomic tests run around $4,000. The news release tries to quantify benefits in two ways. First, it says that “A recent study showed that more than 25 men were being unnecessarily treated with surgery or radiotherapy, for every single life saved.” But how recent was this study? And who published it? Next, the release says that the news test “can pick out life-threatening prostate cancers, with up to 92% accuracy,” although this is not technically correct. In the published study, the authors say that the algorithm resulted in “an AUC of 0.92.” AUC stands for Area Under the Curve, which is not the same measurement as accuracy. The AUC is considered the best measure of whether a test can distinguish between diseased and non-diseased people. In this case, the investigators used their test to differentiate between cancers that were confined to the prostate and those that had spread beyond the prostate among men who had undergone prostatectomy. While these advanced cancers can be life-threatening, that’s a bit of hyperbolic description. Metastatic cancers are clearly the most likely to be life threatening. Additionally, estimates of AUC have 95% confidence intervals. If the AUC, as it appears, was based on results from 4 patients, then 92% is a very imprecise estimate. The news release says that unnecessary radiotherapy and surgery is harmful, but it does not explain any harms of the new tests. Although biopsies are minimally invasive, the Mayo Clinic says that prostate biopsies can cause bleeding and risk of infection. In this test, the tissue was collected only from prostatectomy specimens. Therefore, to actually be useful for preventing over treatment, the test must be assessed in biopsy specimens. The harm would be misclassification — mistakenly telling someone that treatment is unnecessary because the tumor appears to be low-risk when in fact it’s aggressive and would benefit from treatment. Neglecting to provide the number of patients and failing to explain the meaning of 92% accuracy, made this an evidence-free release. (Information on some of the challenges of describing accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests is available in this HealthNewsReview.org toolkit.) After reading the study, it seems that biopsies were only taken from four patients, a very small sample size. The news release also attempted to summarize the methods of the study, but ended up doing so using confusing language and analogies that were hard to parse. The term “life-threatening cancer” was used very loosely. A cancer that has spread beyond the prostate — but not throughout the body–is not necessarily fatal. All funding sources were listed at the bottom of the release. The alternatives to this test include other genomic tests; PSA, Gleason scores from biopsies, and MRI results, none of which are mentioned. The release does say that this test could be an alternative to radiotherapy and surgery (by distinguishing non-aggressive from aggressive cancers), but it doesn’t list any of the harms or benefits of other interventions. It also does not say what treatment options there are should a patient find that they have a non-aggressive form of cancer. At the very end of the news release, the authors write that the next step is, “to take this method out of the laboratory,” and that the researchers hope that they will find a commercial partner to develop the test for general use. But this should have come much sooner, ideally in the first paragraph. The entire release (including the headline) made it sound like this test is already available, likely frustrating patients who felt duped at the end of the release. The news release does attempt to describe the novelty of the test, although the release struggles to describe scientific terms. No sensational or unjustifiable language.",false,"diagnostic test,prostate cancer"
636,26287,"If masks prevent coronavirus, governors would have given them to prison inmates instead of releasing them.","May 19, 2020","Experts agree that wearing facial coverings in close settings provides some measure of protection against spreading the coronavirus. Despite a claim on Facebook, New York, Michigan and California prisons all are providing masks to inmates, as well as staff, as part of their COVID-19 response. Certain groups of inmates are being freed early as a way to try to limit the spread of COVID-19. They include pregnant women with less than six months left on sentences for nonviolent offenses, and other inmates who are either over 60 with health issues or months away from being eligible for parole.",Tom Kertscher,"Health officials and governors in states hit hard by COVID-19 are recommending masks to help contain the spread of the virus. But if masks really work, a Facebook post asks rhetorically, why aren’t governors using them more in jails and prisons that have become COVID-19 hotspots? The post — accompanying images of governors Mario Cuomo of New York, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California — claims the three Democrats have ""released thousands of dangerous prisoners into the public to kill innocent people and cause stress to our citizens,"" and that the governors ""make"" citizens wear masks. ""If the masks actually work to prevent COVID-19,"" the post continues, ""then why didn’t we just hand them out to all inmates … instead of releasing them to prevent the spread?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is inaccurate on several fronts. Medical experts now agree that face coverings help slow the spread of the coronavirus, and the states cited in the post have distributed masks to inmates. Meanwhile, states that are releasing inmates are considering the potential danger to the public in deciding which ones to release. Across the nation in response to the coronavirus, many more inmates are being released from local jails — which hold people charged with crimes or convicted of low-level crimes — than from prisons, which mostly hold people convicted of felonies. That’s according to the nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative, a Massachusetts think tank that advocates for reducing the American prison population, and the New York Times. (In Florida, an inmate released from the Hillsborough County jail, where he was being held on nonviolent drug charges, was charged with second-degree murder the next day.) Some are being released from prisons. In New York, Michigan and California, thousands of prison inmates have been released in response to the coronavirus. The Facebook claim goes too far in characterizing them all as posing a threat to kill. In New York, Cuomo announced in April that pregnant women with less than six months remaining on their sentences for nonviolent offenses would be released from prison. The state announced in March that up to 1,100 inmates being held in local jails for low-level parole violations and deemed not a danger to the public would be released to stem the flow of coronavirus cases in the correctional system. Michigan is releasing 200 prison inmates per week because of the coronavirus, WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids, Mich., reported on April 14. The state is looking to first release inmates eligible for parole who are nonviolent offenders older than 60 with health issues, though no offenses are off-limits, the report said. California announced in March that it planned to release as many as 3,500 prison inmates by expediting the transition to parole for nonviolent offenders with 60 days or less left on their sentences. Correctional and detention facilities pose ""unique challenges"" in combating COVID-19, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Inmates live, work and eat in close settings, heightening the potential for the virus to spread. The virus can be brought into the facility in many ways, including through staff, medical professionals or others who enter from the outside. And options for isolating inmates are limited, the CDC notes. Across the country, more than 25,000 prison inmates have tested positive for COVID-19, and more than 370 of them have died, according to the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that reports on criminal justice. Staff and inmates are required to wear masks amid large outbreaks: New York: More than 1,200 prison staff have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the state. The Department of Corrections requires all staff to wear face masks while on duty and supplies all inmates with surgical-type masks. Michigan: There are more than 2,100 COVID-19 infections among prisoners and Michigan ranks third for the number of prisoner cases, according to the Marshall Project. Each prison employee and inmate has received three masks that can be laundered and worn again, according to the Michigan Department of Corrections. Staff are expected to wear a mask during their entire shift, and prisoners are expected to wear masks except while eating, sleeping or showering. California: More than 430 cases of COVID-19, including five deaths, have been confirmed at the California Institution for Men in Chino, with tents being set up to provide more space and treatment for inmates, the Sacramento Bee reported. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation says it provides masks and hand sanitizer to all staff and prisoners. While masks alone cannot stop the spread of the coronavirus, health officials agree that facial coverings, including ones made of fabric, help slow the spread of the virus, as we’ve reported. The CDC recommends that nearly everyone wear a facial covering while out in public and in areas where social distancing isn’t possible. Higher medical-grade masks offer the most protection, but homemade masks are also effective, particularly when they fit snugly and are made of multiple layers. New research since the start of the coronavirus outbreak supports the use of masks. For correctional facilities, a May 15 CDC report recommends cloth facial coverings, along with physical distancing, movement restrictions and other measures. ""Prompt identification of COVID-19 cases and consistent application of prevention measures are critical to protecting incarcerated and detained persons, correctional and detention facility staff members, and the communities to which they return,"" the report said. A Facebook post claimed that if masks prevent coronavirus, governors in New York, Michigan and California would have given them to prison inmates instead of releasing them. Experts agree that wearing facial coverings in close settings provides some measure of protection against spreading the coronavirus. New York, Michigan and California prisons are providing masks to inmates, as well as staff, as part of their COVID-19 response.

639,8922,"Virus spreads on cruise ship in Japan, U.S. passengers flying home.","February 16, 2020","Hundreds of passengers were preparing to be evacuated from a cruise ship on Sunday after spending two weeks under quarantine off Japan over the coronavirus, with Americans flying home on chartered evacuation planes early Monday morning.","Ju-Min Park, Tetsushi Kajimoto","Seventy more people were confirmed with the virus on board the Diamond Princess on Sunday, bringing the number of cases from the ship to 355, the most anywhere outside China. The luxury cruise voyage with more than 3,000 passengers aboard was struck by the virus earlier this month, leaving them and crew in confinement. Two charter flights operated by Kalitta Air carrying a few hundred American passengers from the ship departed from Haneda Airport on Monday morning. The airline was involved in previous U.S. evacuation operations prompted by the virus outbreak in China. Canada, South Korea, Hong Kong and Italy have followed the United States in announcing flights to bring home their citizens from the ship, which has been under quarantine since Feb. 3. Countries have said passengers should be symptom-free to board the flights, and are likely to face quarantine on arrival. Gay Courter, one of the American passengers on one of the chartered flights, told Reuters they were flying to Travis Air Force Base in California, then would be sent to Omaha or San Antonio for another two week of quarantine on U.S. soil. The other flight will land at Kelly Field Air Force Base, Texas, according to the U.S. Department of Defense. Courter was on the cruise with her husband to celebrate her 75th birthday. Photographs from inside one of the charter flights showed a portable bio-containment unit and a U.S. health official in a protective suit. “Quarantine is necessary. This flight will be hell. Portapotties,” Courter said, referring to the converted cargo plane she was in. Another American passenger, Matthew Smith, posted photos on Twitter showing a fleet of more than 10 buses that took U.S. nationals from Yokohama port to the airport. Smith said U.S. officials, dressed in full hazmat suits and face masks, had visited his room to check if he would disembark. He said he wanted to stay. The charter flights were the only option for eligible U.S. passengers to fly home until March 4 at the earliest, the U.S. embassy in Tokyo has said. The ship, owned by Carnival Corp., has been held in Yokohama since a man who had disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus two weeks ago. The ship, once bustling with busy restaurants, game nights and Broadway-style shows, has been reduced to silence. Those with the disease have been taken to hospital in Japan and no one from the ship has died. Around half of the guests onboard are from Japan. There were approximately 400 U.S. citizens on the ship, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo had said passengers and crew on board the ship were at high risk of exposure to the virus and it recommended its citizens get off and take one of the flights home. “This is a rapidly evolving situation and we are taking additional steps to assist U.S. citizens,” it said. All passengers were to be screened before being allowed on the chartered flights and everyone would be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival back in the United States. “No symptomatic or infected passengers will be allowed to board,” it said. Clyde Smith, 80, who was taken from the ship to a Tokyo hospital after testing positive for the virus, told Reuters on Sunday he had not been told if he would be allowed on a U.S. evacuation plane. Latest figures from Beijing on Sunday showed 68,500 cases of the illness and 1,665 deaths, mostly in Hubei province. Japan detected six fresh cases of the coronavirus on Sunday, apart from those on the ship, the health ministry said, taking the total number of in-land infections to 59.",true,Health News
643,11138,Study Results Published in JAMA Conclude that 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ Exams Outperform Conventional Mammography for Women with Both Dense and Nondense Breasts,"May 4, 2016","This news release describes the results of a large population-based study comparing several screening outcomes (including recall rates and  cancer detection rates) between digital mammography and digital mammography plus tomosynthesis (i.e., Hologic Genius 3D mammography). Although the published study did find a significant difference between the two screening modalities by breast density tissue, the rates were not significant in women with extremely dense breasts. A point the news release failed to mention. Another caveat is that the original research did not look at healthcare savings or any clinical outcomes. But the manufacturers of the 3D mammography tout the the potential savings and improved outcomes in the news release, suggesting to readers that these outcomes are to be expected when their technology is used. Better detection of breast cancer through newer technology is not the same as improving clinical outcomes. Failing to mention that women with extremely dense breasts did not benefit from the newer technology can lead to more confusion for women who may falsely assume the new technology will help them. This release also catches a coat-ride on new legislation adopted by about half of U.S. states that require that women receive notifications of their breast density (BRN) along with their screening mammogram results. These mandated notifications on breast density are not well-regarded by a number of experts since their value to patients is questionable. What are women to do with this information?","Mandy Stahre, PhD,Richard Hoffman, MD,Kathlyn Stone","No discussion of costs or whether the addition of the 3D mammography is covered by insurance policies. This is a huge oversight considering the release touts the potential for significant cost savings. For example, the release states: “This has the potential to provide health systems and insurance companies with significant cost savings, reduce patient stress and expenses, and alleviate challenges for referring physicians who are tasked with relaying mammography results to their patients.” A quick online scan of the cost for this newer technology finds that although the 3D test is FDA-approved, it still isn’t covered by most insurance plans. At least one large clinic using the 3D technology asks patients for an an out-of-pocket payment of $60 and then the 2D portion of the imaging test is billed to insurance. The patient is liable for any outstanding balance after insurance has paid. The news release mentions a 50% increase in invasive cancer detection which on the surface sounds impressive, but they don’t provide enough detail to understand what the 50% increase really means. According to the original study, the digital mammography plus tomosynthesis increased detection of invasive cancers from 3 per 1000 screens to 4.5 per 1000 screens and this high percentage increase was seen in only one of the four groups of breast tissue density. The other two groups had lower increases. (“Mammograms are categorized into four density groups: almost entirely fat, scattered fibroglandular densities, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense,” according to the release.) The news release failed to mention that in women with extremely dense breasts, the 3D mammography was not significantly better at detecting invasive cancer than digital mammography alone. The published study called for caution “in drawing conclusions regarding the performance of tomosynthesis [3D mammography] for the small proportion of women with extremely dense breasts.” We also question the release’s portrayal of 3D mammography providing a “high percentage increase” in detection over conventional mammography. Our calculations show a 0.15% increase in detection rates (0.3% detection rate for conventional vs. 0.45% for 3D). Finally, we need to address outcomes. There is no evidence from the study that finding these additional cancers leads to better outcomes. Finding more cancers with a more sensitive test could be leading to over-diagnosis. Furthermore, the value of finding these cancers earlier is of uncertain value in the absence of outcomes data–which ideally should come from a randomized trial to avoid bias in lead-time. The many broad claims in the release are not fully supported by the evidence. There were no explanations of potential harms of integrating 3D mammography into current breast cancer detection or that this technology does not appear to benefit women with extremely dense breasts. It is unclear if this technology could result in false positives (over-diagnosis) or what the negative predictive value of the test is (the probability that subjects with a negative screening test don’t actually have the disease). If these tests lead to over-diagnosis then women face the harms (and costs) of unnecessary treatment. Although the research letter in JAMA noted that adding tomosynthesis did not produce a significant result in detecting breast cancer for women with extremely dense breasts (one of the four categories of breast density), the news release does not mention this limitation to the study. The news release also takes the evidence from the study and extrapolates to health care savings costs and increased quality of care for women, neither of which were examined in the study. In fact, the original study did not look at clinical outcomes and noted this as a limitation, but the news release does not discuss this caveat. Furthermore, we do not know whether the apparent benefits — in terms of increased cancer detection and decrease in recalls — would be mirrored in routine practice. The results were based on mammograms being performed by high volume sites in a clinical trial. The published research also noted that the study included “insufficient follow-up to determine if increased invasive cancer detection improved clinical outcomes.” The report did not appear to engage in disease mongering. The news release is distributed by the company that makes the 3D mammography so we can assume it played a role in funding the study. What’s troubling is that the release gives no mention of potential conflicts of interest — or the absence of conflict — among the many investigators involved with the study. The published research notes that none of the researchers reported a potential conflict but that five of the researchers received research grant funding from Hologic. Also concerning is a note included with the disclosure section of the study: “The study contracts and data sharing agreements specified that Hologic had the right to review all publications prior to submission, but could not mandate any revision of the manuscript or prevent submission for publication.” At bare minimum the release should have noted that at least some of the researchers received grant funding from the manufacturer. The purpose of study compared digital mammography alone with digital mammography with the addition of 3D mammography. The news release does mention that 3D mammography has been available since 2011 and includes a link to a website where people can enter their zip code to find locations that offer the additional screening test. The claim to novelty is found in this statement in the release: “This new analysis confirms that Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams reduce unnecessary follow-up exams in dense-breasted women. This has the potential to provide health systems and insurance companies with significant cost savings, reduce patient stress and expenses, and alleviate challenges for referring physicians who are tasked with relaying mammography results to their patients.” For the reasons stated above, we think the release makes questionable claims and therefore fails the novelty test so we’re rating this not satisfactory. In addition, the 3D screening technology has been available since 2011. While the release generally uses appropriate language, we’re flagging it for the claim that “an estimated 10 million women in the U.S. benefited from a Genius exam.” Even if 10 million women received exams, not all of them benefited. We think the release should have included some backup for a claim this bold.",false,"Breast cancer,industry/commercial news releases,Screening tests"
644,18796,This is the first time since Roe was decided in 1973 that a court has granted personhood status to the preborn.,"February 8, 2013",Abortion foe overreaches in describing context of court ruling,Janel Davis,"Last month the Alabama Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision. Essentially, the court ruled that a guilty plea for child endangerment entered by a Colbert County mother should stand. Amanda Kimbrough initially entered the guilty plea after her son Timmy died 19 minutes after birth at 25 weeks in April 2008. A medical examiner determined that Timmy died from ""acute methamphetamine intoxication."" After Kimbrough pleaded guilty to charges under Alabama’s chemical endangerment of a child statute, she received the minimum sentence of 10 years. Kimbrough later appealed, saying the chemical endangerment statute did not extend to unborn children. The Alabama ruling included acknowledgment of unborn children in the state’s chemical endangerment statute. Anti-abortion advocates immediately praised the decision as a victory for ""personhood rights of preborn children."" ""This is the first time since Roe (v. Wade) was decided in 1973 that a court has granted personhood status to the preborn,"" Dan Becker, the president of Georgia Right to Life, said in a news release a few days after the Jan. 11 ruling. ""I am greatly encouraged that Georgia, which has proven to be pro-life, will now grant the same protection to our innocent children."" The personhood issue -- defining human life with full rights at the point of conception instead of birth -- has had a long history in this country’s abortion debate. Abortion opponents in several states have pursued personhood efforts since the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion case. So, we wondered: Could the Alabama ruling be a precedent as Becker said? Kimbrough, the Alabama mother, admitted smoking methamphetamine three days before her child was born, according to media reports. Alabama’s chemical endangerment code prohibits a ""responsible person"" from ""exposing a child to an environment in which (the person) … knowingly, recklessly, or intentionally causes or permits a child to be exposed to, to ingest or inhale, or to have contact with a controlled substance, chemical substance, or drug paraphernalia."" In the case of a child’s death due to these circumstances, the result is a Class A felony with a minimum prison term of 10 years. A Georgia Right to Life spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that the organization was not aware of a similar court ruling prior to the Alabama case. ""The tide is turning. More and more people are rejecting the culture of death that has existed for far too long,"" spokeswoman Suzanne Ward said in an email. Personhood USA, a Denver-based organization that opposes abortion, supported Becker’s claim. ""The only personhood effort state-by-state (Virginia and Mississippi, for example)  that has been done is through Personhood USA, and we haven’t gotten anything to pass yet. So right now there are no personhood laws on the books in any state,"" said Jennifer Mason, Personhood’s communications director. The Alabama decision centered on a chemical endangerment statute. But the court ""said women should not take these drugs knowing that they could endanger the child. So it was both a chemical endangerment decision, but also an affirmation of personhood rights for those babies as well,"" Mason said. PolitiFact Georgia put the claim to B. Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Law School. Hill disagreed with Becker’s statement and cited several other cases, including some cited in the Alabama ruling, in which courts have granted personhood status to the preborn. Among them, a 1997 criminal child neglect case in South Carolina involving an expectant mother sentenced to eight years in prison after her child was born with the drug in its system. ""It’s not that uncommon (among courts),"" Hill said. ""Various states have said a fetus could be a child under specific statutes, like criminal child neglect, wrongful death or, in the Alabama case, chemical endangerment."" Steve Crampton, general counsel for Liberty Counsel, which has partnered with Personhood USA on litigation and has worked with Georgia Right to Life, said the Alabama decision ""has great potential application"" outside the chemical endangerment statute. What happens next with the Alabama ruling is unknown, said Paul Horwitz, a constitutional law professor at the University of Alabama. ""I just don’t think it’s a question of a court using the word ‘personhood.’ It’s a question of whether or not there is a right to an abortion and when,"" he said. ""I don’t see that larger constitutional issue as something that is automatically teed up in a useful way because of this court’s ruling."" So was Georgia Right to Life President Dan Becker correct in saying that an Alabama Supreme Court case last month was ""the first time since Roe was decided in 1973 that a court has granted personhood status to the preborn""? Not really. There have been other cases in other states in the 40 years since Roe v. Wade in which courts have decided that a fetus could be a child. Those cases dealt with specific statutes, including criminal child neglect and wrongful death, which were similar to the Alabama case involving a chemical endangerment statute. But there is no general ruling saying a fetus is a person or granting personhood status to the preborn in all circumstances, according to constitutional and reproductive law experts. Becker claimed that no other court had made personhood rulings, but our research found that that is not the case. We rated Becker’s claim .",false,"Abortion, Georgia, Children, Dan Becker, "
645,891,Multidrug-resistant malaria spreading in Southeast Asia: study.,"July 22, 2019","A strain of malaria resistant to two key drugs has spread rapidly from Cambodia and has become dominant in Vietnam, Laos and northern Thailand, with a “terrifying prospect” that it could reach Africa, scientists warned on Monday,",Kate Kelland,"Using gnomic surveillance to track the spread of drug-resistant malaria, the scientists found that the strain, known as KEL1/PLA1, had also evolved and picked up new genetic mutations that may make it yet more resistant. “We discovered (it) had spread aggressively, replacing local malaria parasites, and had become the dominant strain in Vietnam, Laos and northeastern Thailand,” said Roberto Amato, who worked with a team from Britain’s Wellcome Sanger Institute and Oxford University and Thailand’s Mahidol University. The risk is rising that the new strain could threaten sub-Saharan Africa, where most malaria cases and deaths occur, largely among babies and children. “This highly successful resistant parasite strain is capable of invading new territories and acquiring new genetic properties, raising the terrifying prospect that it could spread to Africa ... as resistance to chloroquine did in the 1980s, contributing to millions of deaths,” said Olivo Miotto of Oxford University, who co-led the work. Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are carried by mosquitoes and spread through their blood-sucking bites. Almost 220 million people were infected with malaria in 2017, according to World Health Organization estimates, and 400,000 succumbed to it. Malaria can be treated with medicines if caught early enough, but evolving drug-resistance - such as the spread of chloroquine-resistant malaria across Asia to Africa from the late 1950s to the 1980 - has hampered efforts to eliminate it. The first-line treatment in many parts of Asia in the last decade has been a combination of dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine, also known as DHA-PPQ. Researchers found in previous work that a strain of malaria resistant to this combination had evolved and spread across Cambodia between 2007 and 2013. This latest research, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, found it had crossed borders and tightened its grip. Miotto said further work was now needed to establish how far this resistance had spread and whether it had evolved further - and eventually to understand which drugs would work against resistant malaria parasites. “Other drugs may be effective at the moment but the situation is extremely fragile,” he said.",true,Health News
646,8007,U.S. panel outlines how doctors should ration care in a pandemic.,"March 31, 2020",A panel of advisers issued recommendations for new crisis treatment standards on Monday advising doctors and hospitals on how they should decide which patients with COVID-19 get lifesaving care and which do not.,Julie Steenhuysen,"The report from a National Academies of Sciences committee offers a framework for treating patients during the COVID-19 crisis that shifts from saving individual patients to a focus on saving the most individuals possible. It was issued at the request of Admiral Brett Giroir, U.S. assistant secretary for health and Robert Kadlec, U.S. assistant secretary of preparedness and response. The new Crisis Standards of Care guidelines come as the United States faces the prospect of rationing ventilators and other essential equipment to cope with a surge of severely ill patients infected with the new respiratory virus that is projected to kill between 100,000 and 200,000 people in the United States. In the report, the panel says that in spite of efforts to forestall the virus, it expects “a growing number of hospitals will face medical needs that outpace the existing supply of ventilators, protective equipment and other essentials, as well as the rate that enhanced supply can be produced, acquired and put into place. These circumstances will require a shift to Crisis Standards of Care.”  The panel says there is “an imminent need to prepare for difficult decisions about allocating limited resources, triaging patients to receive life-saving care and minimizing the negative impacts of delivering care under crisis conditions.”  First issued in 2009, Crisis Standards of Care were used sporadically to help doctors respond to Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and doctors were preparing to use them in the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, but never did, experts said. They characterized the government’s request for an updated report - tailored to the COVID-19 pandemic - as both sobering and responsible. “It’s important that we have these ahead of time so that doctors don’t have to decide these things on the fly,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist and senior scholar at the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “This is serious business,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “If it’s not done, no one gets good care.”  According to the National Academies, the standards shift the focus from what is best for the individual to what can help save the most lives, especially when equipment, staffing and materials are in short supply. They do not dictate which choices should be made, but provide a framework for making them. They also protect physicians from malpractice lawsuits, said Lawrence Gostin, an expert in global health law at Georgetown University, who helped write the original guidelines in 2009. Gostin said individual states were responsible for setting malpractice standards, but in a pandemic, the hope is that the federal government would implement the standards nationally, which would then be passed along to states and then to local hospitals. Gostin said the fact that U.S. officials requested the report signals “an urgency in trying to prepare hospitals for acute shortages, which will have implications for deciding who can live and who can die.”  Under normal standards of care, doctors in the United States have a duty to provide the highest-quality treatment available. “If someone is in respiratory arrest and the standard of care is a ventilator and there aren’t enough, doctors can be sued,” Gostin said. Dr. Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin, said shifting to crisis standards allowed states or healthcare providers to relax or change certain rules, such as using medical devices in ways they were not originally approved for, if they offer a “better-than-nothing option.”  A key principle is that doctors never withhold care solely because of age, disability, race or gender. “These are critical life or death decisions. Doctors and hospitals shouldn’t be making them themselves,” Gostin said.",true,Health News

649,36496,"Childrens' YouTube, TikTok, Roblox, and Fortnite channels feature videos with deeply disturbing and violent messages.","February 19, 2019","Violent, Disturbing Messages in Childrens’ Videos?",  Kim LaCapria  ,"On February 12 2019, Facebook user Meridy Leeper shared an image purportedly of a drawing by her young child and the following message about suicidal ideation in small children apparently prompted by videos beneath parental radar on YouTube, TikTok, Roblox, and Fortnite — among other platforms:This is an exceptionally hard thing for me to post. I’ve thought long and hard about this. I’ve decided it’s way too important not to bring awareness to other parents. This is not up for criticism. I only want to let all parents know what to watch for….Kids youtube, roblox, fortnight… no matter how much you think you are monitoring your child.. notifications to what your child is watching. It doesn’t matter. My 7 year old child was taught how to attempt suicide by kids youtube and these games. She has expressed that she doesn’t feel neglected or unloved. Instead, she was constantly told to ‘go kill yourself’ by other gamers, by kids youtube. Shown HOW to.Sunday night, she had a full blown anxiety attack. Which I held her and sang to her while she got through it. Monday, she drew this in school.This is a VERY real danger! I NEVER thought I would find myself helping my SEVEN YEAR OLD CHILD through an anxiety attack. PLEASE, keep your children away from these things. I’m just so glad my child was able to express her feelings before she actually tried to harm herself. I never thought something as ‘innocent’ as kids youtube would have these subliminal messages. Again, I’m only sharing our experience in the hopes to prevent another child going through this.This claim appeared to be more than the usual social media panics. In March 2017, TheOutline.com was among news sites covering sinister and alarming videos embedded in content played for preschool children. In that report, the writer described coming across what she described as “off brand” Peppa Pig clips on YouTube:The video, titled “#Peppa #Pig #Dentist #Kids #Animation #Fantasy,” is completely horrifying. Though the animation sort of looks like an actual episode of Peppa Pig, it’s poorly done, and the narrative quickly veers into upsetting territory. Peppa goes to the dentist, who has a giant needle and a lot of scary tools. The pigs are mysteriously forest green rather than pink. Burglars appear to try to burgle.Peppa Pig is a show for preschoolers. Knock-off Peppa Pig is the stuff of nightmares.Later that month, BBC also covered a spate of videos that appeared to be for young children, but that harbored disturbing or frightening scenes packaged as wholesome content:Hundreds of these videos exist on YouTube, and some generate millions of views. One channel “Toys and Funny Kids Surprise Eggs” is one of the top 100 most watched YouTube accounts in the world – its videos have more than 5 billion views.Its landing page features a photo of a cute toddler alongside official-looking pictures of Peppa Pig, Thomas the Tank Engine, the Cookie Monster, Mickey and Minnie Mouse and Elsa from Frozen.But the videos on the channel have titles like “FROZEN ELSA HUGE SNOT”, “NAKED HULK LOSES HIS PANTS” and “BLOODY ELSA: Frozen Elsa’s Arm is Broken by Spiderman”. They feature animated violence and graphic toilet humour.In June 2018, the Guardian revisited the issue and widespread discussion of its effects on forums for parents:Parents reported that their children were encountering knock-off editions of their favourite cartoon characters in situations of violence and death: Peppa Pig drinking bleach, or Mickey Mouse being run over by a car. A brief Google of some of the terms mentioned in the article brought up not only many more accounts of inappropriate content, in Facebook posts, newsgroup threads, and other newspapers, but also disturbing accounts of their effects. Previously happy and well-adjusted children became frightened of the dark, prone to fits of crying, or displayed violent behaviour and talked about self-harm – all classic symptoms of abuse. But despite these reports, YouTube and its parent company, Google, had done little to address them. Moreover, there seemed to be little understanding of where these videos were coming from, how they were produced – or even why they existed in the first place. […]For adults, it’s the sheer weirdness of many of the videos that seems almost more disturbing than their violence. This is the part that’s harder to explain – and harder for people to understand – if you don’t immerse yourself in the videos, which I’d hardly recommend. Beyond the simple knock-offs and the provocations exists an entire class of nonsensical, algorithm-generated content; millions and millions of videos that serve merely to attract views and produce income, cobbled together from nursery rhymes, toy reviews, and cultural misunderstandings. Some seem to be the product of random title generators, others – so many others – involve real humans, including young children, distributed across the globe, acting out endlessly the insane demands of YouTube’s recommendation algorithms, even if it makes no sense, even if you have to debase yourself utterly to do it.The Guardian cited a 2017 New York Times investigation of the “dark corners” of content platforms for preschool and grade school children, which, like other accounts, began with a parent’s unexpected brush with violent and suggestive content:It was a typical night in Staci Burns’s house outside Fort Wayne, Ind. She was cooking dinner while her 3-year-old son, Isaac, watched videos on the YouTube Kids app on an iPad. Suddenly he cried out, “Mommy, the monster scares me!”When Ms. Burns walked over, Isaac was watching a video featuring crude renderings of the characters from “PAW Patrol,” a Nickelodeon show that is popular among preschoolers, screaming in a car. The vehicle hurtled into a light pole and burst into flames.The 10-minute clip, “PAW Patrol Babies Pretend to Die Suicide by Annabelle Hypnotized,” was a nightmarish imitation of an animated series in which a boy and a pack of rescue dogs protect their community from troubles like runaway kittens and rock slides. In the video Isaac watched, some characters died and one walked off a roof after being hypnotized by a likeness of a doll possessed by a demon. […]While the offending videos are a tiny fraction of YouTube Kids’ universe, they are another example of the potential for abuse on digital media platforms that rely on computer algorithms, rather than humans, to police the content that appears in front of people — in this case, very young people.As of late February 2019, that exact video is still up and appears to have been untouched by YouTube moderators. It can be viewed here.Amidst ongoing parental concern over “dark” and “violent” preschool videos, another rumor spread: that these videos are sparking violent or suicidal behavior in young people. It is similar to a 2016 rumor about Internet interest in the purported “Blue Whale” suicide game; that appeared to mostly involve teenagers, but those stories have unsettling commonalities involving violent ideation and suicide contagion.While individual anecdotes about their effects (such as the Facebook post quoted above) are not verifiable beyond doubt without more data, the existence of the described content is certainly documented, and it does not seem like a stretch to assume that children are imitating the behavior they see displayed by familiar, trusted characters. Platforms such as childrens’ YouTube, TikTok, Roblox, and Fortnite channels are aware that the videos appear, but they do not seem to have made any effort to stop those same videos from spreading. The claim is true — videos with sinister and suggestive content masquerading as popular preschool videos (like Peppa Pig and Paw Patrol) remain on children’s content streaming platforms.",true,"Fact Checks, Viral Content"
650,9697,"New class of blood pressure meds as effective as old, analysis shows","January 7, 2016","This Washington Post story reports the findings of a study that compared the efficacy of two classes of drugs available to treat cardiovascular disease (CVD) — angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE, inhibitors versus newer angiotensin receptor blockers, or ARBs. It involved a meta-analysis of more than 100 earlier studies monitoring more than a quarter-million patients who were at high risk for CVD. The results showed the two types of drugs to be equally effective with the major difference being a lower chance of side effects with the use of ARBs. With a bit more information on harms and a better grasp of the limitations of this study, the Post’s coverage is more solid than a competing HealthDay story that was based on a news release. But the story lacks voices other than that of the study’s lead author, and it doesn’t disclose the relationships that several of the authors have with the pharmaceutical industry. For patients with high blood pressure, there are numerous studies that demonstrate medications to lower blood pressure are associated with decreased rates of heart attacks, strokes and to a lesser extent, kidney failure. Given the number of different choices available from a range of classes of medications, how do patients and doctors decide on which to use? Here the comparison is between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). When considering which agent to use for a given patient, a physician generally considers the relative benefits, harms and costs of the different agents, as well as any patient factors that may lead one class of agents to have particular advantages or limitations (for example, if the patient already has a high potassium level, use of either an ACEI or ARB may be problematic since they both raise potassium levels further). The current study seeks to address mainly the relative benefits of these two classes of medicines and glosses over harms and costs while not even mentioning patient-level factors. In terms of the benefits, the authors suggest that initial studies comparing ACEIs and ARBs were biased by the times in which the original studies used to justify approval were performed. Specifically, the older ACEIs studies came at a time when lifestyle and other medication options were more limited than the following decades when ARBs were studied. It is difficult to confirm or refute this assumption, but studies of these classes in a more comparable time frame would decrease bias associated with temporal trends. The current study adds evidence that these two classes are similar, but this isn’t really dramatically new information. Indeed, many guidelines suggest ACEIs or ARBs as being equivalent. The advantage of ARBs is better tolerability, as mentioned in this article, but the disadvantage remains cost. Though the article provides one line saying that with more generics available for ARBs, the cost difference has diminished, but even the cost of generics appear higher for ARBs than ACEIs. Thus, for many clinicians even an increased recognition of similar benefits may not lead to much change in practice given differences in costs","Earle Holland,Steven J. Atlas, MD, MPH,Kevin Lomangino","While the story could have been a bit more specific, it gets points for stating that most ACE inhibitor drugs, and many ARB drugs, are now available in generic form, which means the cost for the medications would usually be considerably less than their comparative name-brand compounds. We’ll rate this Satisfactory, but we’d add that though more ARBs are generically available, this class of medications continues to be more expensive than ACEIs. For patients struggling to meet the cost of their medications, this is a major consideration, and important information for any news story. The story points out that the two classes of drugs prescribed for cardiovascular disease are mostly equally effective. It also points out that the main difference lies with the fact that patients report that ARBs are linked to fewer unpleasant side effects, compared to ACE inhibitors. And since patients are usually kept on the drugs for long periods of time, if not indefinitely, that information is important to readers. But the story never says what outcomes exactly we’re talking about here — deaths, heart attacks, blood pressure? Nor does it say how effective these medications were at improving these outcomes — merely that they are equivalent. We think both of these issues should have been addressed in order to earn a Satisfactory rating here. The story does point to the greater occurrence of a dry cough as a result of taking ACE inhibitors compared to taking ARBs but a quick web search for both drug types shows a much larger list of possible side effects including dizziness, headaches, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure, weakness, and skin rash, as well as increased potassium levels and possible sexual dysfunction. A similar omission is present in a HealthDay story that explained the same research. Cough is the most common side effect of ACEI that is not generally seen with ARBs. The one other one is angioedema which is more common with ACEI. Otherwise studies show that other side effects are probably similar. This isn’t stated explicitly, but we’ll give the benefit of the doubt. The story is accurate in characterizing this research as a “second look,” or reanalysis of more than a hundred earlier studies comparing both classes of drugs with placebos and with each other since 2000. But while the story is cautious in saying that one class of drugs “may be as effective and safe” as the other, the headline is much more definitive, stating that “New class of blood pressure meds as effective as old, analysis shows.”  The story closes with a nod to limitations, stating that the study was limited to those who did not have heart failure, “and because it involved a retrospective analysis of trials it was unable to control for differences in the design or data gathering of the previous work.” The story does not appear to commit disease-mongering. The single quoted source in this story is the main author of the study and the story fails to mention that some authors have ties to major pharmaceutical firms which manufacture these kinds of drugs. While that linkage doesn’t mean the research is definitely biased, writers should disclose that information when available. Since the story involves the comparison of two classes of drugs for treating cardiovascular disease, there are obviously treatment options available. The story does point out that ACE inhibitor drugs have been available for decades and that ARBs have been available since the year 2000. The novelty here is simply that this meta-analysis is aimed at clarifying uncertainty surrounding the comparison of these two classes of drugs and their efficacy in treating cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of this condition within the population makes it a topic of broad interest, both among the public and among the professionals who treat them. It would be difficult to conclude that this story relied solely on a news release, given that it provided some facts not present in the NYU release. However, the story does not stray far from the information included in the release and could benefit from additional source information and comment. However, its similarity to the NYU news release is far less than that of a HealthDay story about the same research.",true,"drug costs,high blood pressure"
653,35522,"Thirty-three Florida labs were busted for ""cooking the books"" or tampering with data after not reporting negative COVID-19 test results between March and July 2020.","July 20, 2020","What's true: At least 45 COVID-19 testing laboratories in Florida failed to report negative test results between March and July 2020, thus inaccurate positive testing rates were recorded for those facilities. However, more than 300 Florida labs did report negative results in that time frame. What's undetermined: Although health officials said that all laboratories are required to report both positive and negative test results, testing facilities that Snopes spoke with said that among other discrepancies in reporting requirements, the Florida Department of Health did not previously require negative test results to be reported. Snopes did not find evidence that the omission of negative results data in a minority of Florida labs' reporting was intentional or nefarious.",Madison Dapcevich,"In July 2020, social media posts and news reports claimed that Florida labs were intentionally tampering with data by failing to report negative COVID-19 test results, making the coronavirus pandemic appear much worse in the southern state. The claims followed an investigation conducted by Orlando affiliate station Fox 35, which analyzed COVID-19 testing and case data collected between March 16, 2020, when testing began, and July 13, 2020, by the Florida Department of Health (DOH). Of the hundreds of labs analyzed, many were shown to have reported very high positivity rates for COVID-19. The accusations of tampering came as many health officials and local leaders came under criticism for their handling of the coronavirus pandemic and testing responses. Snopes dug through the 49-page report line-by-line and found that at least 45 laboratories that tested for COVID-19 did not report negative test results between March and July 2020 and instead showed 100% positivity, while dozens of others reported 90% positivity and higher. More than 300 labs did report negative test results, clocking percentage rates much lower than 100%. The table below shows labs that tested 40 or more people and reported 100% positivity, and failed to report negative test results:  Public and private testing facilities are required to report their results to the DOH, which then releases a daily report covering surveillance data for every county in the state. DOH confirmed to Snopes that a number of testing labs did not report negative test results and issued the following statement in an email sent July 15, 2020: All COVID-19 cases are confirmed through diagnostic and antigen testing and then reported to the state by the labs performing the testing. Private and public laboratories are required to report positive and negative test results to the state immediately. In recent days, the Florida Department of Health noticed that some smaller, private labs weren’t reporting negative test result data to the state. The Department immediately began working with those labs to ensure that all results were being reported in order to provide comprehensive and transparent data. As the state continues to receive results from various labs, the Department will continue educating these labs on proper protocol for reporting COVID-19 test results. The department did not respond to follow-up questions about whether this lack of reporting could have skewed data on total case counts. It is not yet determined why these smaller labs did not report negative cases, and the department did not answer approximately how many negative test results were unreported. We will provide an update once these questions are answered. Labs Snopes spoke to claimed there were discrepancies and changes in DOH’s data reporting requirements. In an email sent to Snopes, Pancare of Florida President R. Michael Hill said that the DOH “misdirected their data collection process as an inaccuracy on PanCare’s part.” The testing lab said that it uses three methods for testing including one that detects viral antigens, which the DOH reportedly said it would not include “into the county or state numbers.” On July 1, DOH implemented an update to its electronic reporting process to “report all patient-specific results” daily and began integrating previously reported data from PanCare as of July 16. Lab24 in Miami confirmed this statement when it told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel that it had tested around 10,000 people in Florida but that the state required that private labs only notify health officials of positive results. Snopes contacted Lab24 but did not receive a response at the time of publication. “In short, yes the COVID-19 data for the State of Florida is skewed, PanCare has conducted over 6,900 antibody tests, and over 16,000 antigen tests that have not been accurately reported by the Florida Department of Health because they refused to accept the results of both of these FDA-EUA approved tests at the time they were administered,” wrote Hill. Lee Memorial Hospital Lab told Snopes that it had accurately reported both negative and positive test results but that a hospital can have more than one entry in the DOH database. For example, results from Lee Memorial Hospital and Lee Memorial Hospital Lab come from the same testing facility yet each reported different rates. Lee Memorial Hospital reported an 18% positivity rate of 2,925 tests conducted while Lee Memorial Hospital Lab reported 100% positivity of 405 COVID-19 tests conducted. When combined, the overall positive results from the two hospitals were between 15 and 25%.",false,"Medical, COVID-19"

This is based on his support for a plan to allow for over-the-counter sales of the pill. Gardner’s plan is lacking in concrete details that would allow a thorough evaluation. There’s some evidence that health care costs generally go down when drugs are made available over-the-counter, but those studies did not look specifically look at the pill. There is a lot of uncertainty and experts — from advocates to economists — question whether Gardner’s proposal would be cheaper to most consumers or the health care system compared to the Affordable Care Act. And Gardner’s plan would only address one type of contraceptive, meaning the many people who choose other methods of birth control would see higher costs.",Steve Contorno,"Democratic Sen. Mark Udall has consistently attacked his Republican challenger, Rep. Cory Gardner, for supporting anti-abortion measures like personhood legislation. But Gardner is on the offensive with a new ad airing in the Colorado Senate race about women’s health issues. ""What’s the difference between me and Mark Udall on contraception?"" Gardner says. ""I believe the pill ought to be available over the counter, around the clock, without a prescription. Cheaper and easier for you. Mark Udall’s plan is different. He wants to keep government bureaucrats between you and your health care plan. That means more politics and more profits for drug companies. My plan means more rights, more freedom and more control for you."" Udall’s ""plan"" is essentially the Affordable Care Act, which requires health insurance companies to provide access to FDA-approved contraceptives without cost sharing, meaning the consumer pays nothing for their prescription at the pharmacy. Gardner, who has repeatedly voted to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law, says he believes a ""cheaper and easier"" alternative is to allow the pill to be sold over the counter, meaning without a prescription. Gardner’s campaign said his plan has two parts: Allow the pill to be sold over-the-counter and ""ensure that women can be reimbursed for those through insurance."" His campaign said both can be accomplished without the Affordable Care Act. If the Affordable Care Act is not repealed, though, Gardner wants to allow insurance providers to cover the pill over-the-counter without a prescription. Udall’s campaign said he supports allowing over-the-counter sales of the pill as long as insurance companies are still mandated to cover it without any cost sharing. So we’re left comparing the Affordable Care Act to Gardner’s position, which is repeal the ACA and replace its contraceptive component with his proposal. Which contraceptive plan is ""cheaper and easier""? We found that even the groups that advocate making the pill available over the counter — like Jessica Arons, president and CEO of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project and Dan Grossman, vice president for research at Ibis Reproductive Health — did not believe it was a cheaper alternative for consumers than requiring insurance companies to cover contraceptives without cost sharing. Gardner’s campaign pointed us to a study by the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, an advocacy group for the consumer health care products industry. The study looked at savings from several different drugs becoming available over-the-counter, but not the pill. The group estimated that each dollar spent on over-the-counter medicines saves the health care system up to $7, which comes to $102 billion annually. About $25 billion of those savings come in the form of reduced drug costs. But the bulk of the savings is actually from avoiding trips to the doctor to get a prescription, the association found. (Imagine going to the doctor every time you had a cold to get a prescription for Sudafed or for Claritin when your allergies flared up. Those visits add up.) However, under the Affordable Care Act, women’s preventive health care must be covered without cost-sharing, meaning a trip to the doctor to get a prescription for birth control would not have any out-of-pocket costs. So a big chunk of the alleged savings from moving the pill over-the-counter would not be realized; it’s already not costing consumers anything. It’s also speculative for Gardner to insist that his plan is cheaper. As far as we can tell, there hasn’t been a study that looks specifically at the cost benefits of moving the pill over-the-counter, and a spokesperson for the Consumer Healthcare Products Association told us that they ""can't speak to any specific product or ingredient."" That’s not to say that providing birth control without cost-sharing, as the Affordable Care Act does, is free to the healthcare system. When insurance companies are required to cover birth control or doctor visits without asking for a co-payment, those costs are baked into the monthly premium. You may not have to pay anything at the pharmacy, but you may pay for it in other ways, especially if you previously chose not to purchase insurance and suddenly are forced by the law to buy a policy. Some grandfathered plans may also choose to not cover these services and it does not address the millions of individuals who would remain uninsured under the law. Zack Cooper, a health policy and economics professor at Princeton University, said it’s possible that if the pill was reclassified as over-the-counter, consumers would have more options, sales volume would go up and competition would increase between drug companies. These factors can all lead to prices going down. But he said it’s also possible that it has a negative effect, since suddenly consumers are paying for birth control at the point-of-purchase instead of getting it at no cost. ""When you make something even a little more expensive, use goes down,"" Cooper said. ""That means more women get pregnant, and babies cost a lot more than birth control. You can argue it would actually increase the cost of insurance and the government will be on the hook for more federal subsidies."" So there’s a lot of uncertainty as to which would actually be cheaper. We would also like to see more details from Gardner on how he would ""ensure that women can be reimbursed for (the pill) through insurance,"" but so far he has not produced legislation or a detailed summary. And Gardner’s plan only applies to one particular birth control: the pill. While the pill is the most common form of birth control, it’s not the only method. About 27 percent of female contraceptive users reported that the pill was their prefered method, meaning three-quarters use another option (though this survey included male condoms and vasectomies, which aren’t covered by the law and make up a big chunk of contraceptive use). Other birth control methods may be more effective or more preferable for certain patients, but they are also a lot more expensive at the point of purchase, said Alina Salganicoff, vice president and director of Women’s Health Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Like intrauterine devices, which can cost $500 to $1,000 without insurance. So when Gardner asks ""what’s the difference between me and Mark Udall on contraception,"" but only provides a plan for the pill, he’s leaving out a lot of people who medically cannot use the pill or chose another option. Absent the Affordable Care Act, these other methods would undoubtedly be more expensive for consumers. Similarly, it would definitely be ""easier"" for a lot of individuals to obtain the pill over-the-counter instead of going to a doctor first to get a prescription, especially those who live in rural areas where a doctor’s office is not nearly as close as the corner pharmacy. But this again does not address all contraceptives, just the pill. Gardner’s campaign also noted that the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued an opinion in 2012 expressing medical support for over-the-counter access to oral contraceptives. However, the group also maintained its support for the Affordable Care Act provision that provides women access to the pill without cost-sharing, noting that ""numerous studies have shown that even small cost-sharing requirements can limit use of needed preventative care."" Our ruling Gardner said his plan on contraceptives is ""cheaper and easier for you"" than Sen. Mark Udall’s plan. This is based on his support for a plan to allow for over-the-counter sales of the pill. Gardner’s plan is lacking in concrete details that would allow a thorough evaluation. There’s some evidence that health care costs generally go down when drugs are made available over-the-counter, but those studies did not look specifically look at the pill. There is a lot of uncertainty and experts — from advocates to economists — question whether Gardner’s proposal would be cheaper to most consumers or the health care system compared to the Affordable Care Act.

But he did not report falling ill until several days after arriving, when he went to the hospital with a fever. It’s possible that even if current screening measures had been in place, Duncan would have passed without showing a fever or other symptoms.",Lauren Carroll,"How much airport Ebola screening is too much? That was the big question on the Sunday talk shows Oct. 26. Over the weekend, New York, New Jersey and Illinois upped their Ebola screening guidelines, quarantining anyone passing through John F. Kennedy, Newark and Chicago-O'Hare international airports who had contact with Ebola patients, even if they’re not showing symptoms. The guidelines surpass federal regulations and have been subject to criticism, particularly from administration officials, arguing that they are unnecessary. JFK, Newark and O'Hare already have screening processes, along with three other American airports, (more on that later) and people who aren’t showing symptoms aren’t contagious, experts say. On CNN’s State of the Union, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said New York and New Jersey’s quarantine might be unnecessary. But that doesn’t change the fact that the country’s Ebola screening hasn’t been adequate so far -- it missed Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed in the United States, who died Oct. 8. ""We had Mr. Duncan come in (to the United States) with an elevated temperature. We weren’t checking it, and now we’re playing catch-up,"" Issa said. The New York and New Jersey guidelines were put in place after a doctor in New York City tested positive for the disease Oct. 23. He arrived in New York Oct. 17 from Guinea, where he had been treating Ebola patients, and had been checking his temperature twice a day. It doesn’t appear that this patient, Dr. Craig Spencer, was showing symptoms when he first arrived in the United States. But what about Duncan -- is Issa right in saying that he came to the United States with a fever (Issa's office did not respond to our request for comment.) Duncan’s fever On Sept. 20, when Duncan arrived at Dulles International Airport in Washington from Liberia (via Belgium), American airports were not yet screening travelers for possible signs of Ebola. But Duncan went through screening Sept. 19 in Monrovia, Liberia, where he presented a temperature of 97.3 degrees -- so he didn’t have a fever when he boarded the plane -- according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials who reviewed Duncan’s airport screening record. (According to the National Institutes of Health, the normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and a fever starts at a body temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.) We (and Issa) can’t know with certainty if Duncan had acquired a fever by the time he arrived at Dulles. But he did not report falling ill until several days later, when he went to the hospital Sept. 25 with a 100.1 degree fever. It was during this first visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital that Duncan wasn’t examined appropriately. The nurse documented that Duncan had a temperature of 100.1 degrees. It was only after a physician examined him that she included in his record that he had recently arrived from Africa. He was discharged early the next morning. He returned to the hospital Sept. 28 and died there about 10 days later. We should note that Liberian authorities said Duncan lied on the airport Ebola screening questionnaire by answering ""no"" to questions about whether he had contact with an Ebola patient or cared for one or touched the body of someone who had died of Ebola. It was found out later that Duncan helped carry 19-year-old Marthalene Williams into a taxi to go to the hospital. She was seven months pregnant and was turned away at the hospital due to lack of space in the Ebola ward. She died several hours later. It is unclear whether Duncan knew of her diagnosis. Airport screenings Airport screenings in West African airports, like the one Duncan went through, have been going on since at least August. According to the CDC, exit screening might look different in each country but the basic elements are the same. All travelers must have their temperature taken, answer a questionnaire about their health and exposure history and are visually assessed for signs of potential illness. Travelers who show symptoms or signs of exposure are separated and assessed further which ultimately determines whether they are allowed to travel. Screenings are also taking place at airports in England, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Egypt, Canada and now the United States. The first week of October -- the week Duncan died -- the CDC and Department of Homeland Security instituted new airport screening guidelines to supplement the screening already taking place in West Africa airports. Travelers from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone arriving at five major American airports now have to go through an Ebola screening process. After passport review, they will have their temperature taken and answer questions about possible exposure. If they show possible signs of Ebola or exposure, they will be passed on to a public health authority. If not, the traveler will receive information about self-monitoring for symptoms. The five international airports -- John F. Kennedy, Newark, O’Hare, Dulles and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson -- already handled 94 percent of arrivals from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. On Oct. 21, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson announced that all travelers coming to America from those three countries would have to go through the five designated American airports. Our ruling Issa said Thomas Eric Duncan came into the United States ""with an elevated temperature."" According to the CDC, Duncan did not have a fever when he left Monrovia. At the time, American airports were not screening travelers, so there’s no way for us (or Issa) to know definitively if he had a fever when he got to the United States. But he did not report falling ill until several days after arriving, when he went to the hospital with a fever.

And public health officials advise everyone to wear face masks in public to prevent the spread of the virus. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Research on whether the drug could assuage symptoms is not conclusive.",Daniel Funke,"Millions of people, including the president of the United States, have seen or shared a video in which a doctor ly claims there is a cure for the coronavirus, and it’s a medley starring hydroxychloroquine. The video shows several doctors in white coats giving a press conference outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. It persists on social media despite bans from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and it was published by Breitbart, a conservative news site. The July 27 event was organized by Tea Party Patriots, a conservative group backed by Republican donors, and attended by U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. In the video, members of a new group called America’s Frontline Doctors touch on several unproven conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic. One of the most inaccurate claims comes from Dr. Stella Immanuel, a Houston-based primary care physician and minister with a track record of making bizarre medical claims, such as believing in alien DNA. ""This virus has a cure. It is called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Zithromax,"" Immanuel said. ""I know you people want to talk about a mask. Hello? You don’t need a mask. There is a cure."" As of July 27, nearly 150,000 Americans had died because of the coronavirus. Could those deaths have been prevented by a drug that’s used to treat lupus and arthritis? No. Immanuel’s statement is wrong on several points. There is no known cure for COVID-19. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is no specific antiviral treatment for the virus. Supportive care, such as rest, fluids and fever relievers, can assuage symptoms. ""There is currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19,"" according to the World Health Organization. In spite of Immanuel’s anecdotal evidence, hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other drugs is not a proven treatment (or cure) for COVID-19. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. In mid-June, the FDA revoked its emergency authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients. ""It is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of HCQ and CQ may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks,"" FDA Chief Scientist Denise M. Hinton wrote. The WHO and the National Institutes of Health have also stopped their hydroxychloroquine studies. Among the safety issues associated with treating COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine include heart rhythm problems, kidney injuries, and liver problems. While some studies have found that the drug could help alleviate symptoms associated with COVID-19, the research is not conclusive. Few studies have been accepted into peer-reviewed journals. And large, randomized trials — the gold standard for clinical trials — are still needed to confirm the findings of studies conducted since the pandemic began. In the video, Immanuel cited a 2005 study that found chloroquine — not hydroxychloroquine — was ""effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV,"" the official name for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. But the drug was not tested on humans, the authors wrote that more research was needed to make any conclusions, and SARS is different from COVID-19. Health officials advise everyone to wear masks in public. The reason why has to do with how the coronavirus spreads. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they expel respiratory droplets containing the virus. Those droplets can then land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. Since some people infected with the coronavirus may exhibit no symptoms, public health officials say everyone should cover their faces in public — even if they feel well. ""The spread of COVID-19 can be reduced when cloth face coverings are used along with other preventive measures, including social distancing, frequent handwashing, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces,"" according to the CDC. In a viral video, Immanuel said there is a cure for COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine can treat it and people don’t need to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus. All of those claims are inaccurate. There is no known cure for COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine is not a proven treatment, and public health officials advise everyone to wear face masks in public.

It survived unknown for three days until the snake started eating her appendix. In addition to the aforementioned tale of a snake crawling into a woman’s vagina and eating her appendix, this image has also been accompanied by stories about tapeworms, eels, and anal insertions, and is frequently included in galleries exhibiting examples of the “weirdest things found inside the human body.” For example, the website Bold Sky used this image in March 2016 to illustrate a story about a man who inserted an eel into his anus: Lolz! This is the funniest of all. A man from China admitted himself to a hospital when he accidentally got a live eel stuck inside his anus. He said that he was inspired by the porno world so much that he wanted to try something unique. Doctors claim that the eel was alive when the man was being operated, but it died shortly after it was removed.

By his own estimates, Daraprim is cheaper than cancer and rare disease drugs, which he considers Daraprim’s ""peers."" By others, Daraprim costs about the same, if not more. Yet experts told us cancer and rare disease drugs are not Daraprim’s peers. Daraprim’s patent expired more than six decades ago and is a niche generic drug. The same cannot be said of cancer treatments.",Linda Qiu,"The CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, the company that jacked up the cost of a life-saving drug from $13.50 to $750 essentially overnight, says the new price tag is still below market value. Martin Shkreli, a 32-year-old former hedge fund manager, was singled out as the man behind Turing’s controversial decision. So Shkreli took to the airwaves to defend himself, insisting that the price hike was altruistic or, at the very least, not unique. ""You only need less than 100 pills so at the end of the day, the price for treatment – to save your life – was only $1,000,"" Shkreli told Bloomberg TV on Sept. 21, 2015. ""These days, in modern pharmaceuticals, cancer drugs can cost $100,000 or more, rare disease drugs can cost half a million dollars. Daraprim is still underpriced, relative to its peers."" Daraprim is used to treat a parasitic infection known as toxoplasmosis, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers a leading cause of death attributed to food-borne illnesses. The Toxoplasma parasite can be transmitted through contaminated food,  water, and kitchen utensils as well as contact with infected cat feces. While 60 million Americans carry the parasite with no symptoms, it can become deadly for those with weakened immune systems. We were curious about Shkreli’s claim that Daraprim’s new price was comparable to ""its peers."" (Shkreli has since said that he would lower the price amid the outrage, but he did not reveal the new price.) Neither Shkreli nor Turing Pharmaceuticals got back to us for this fact-check, but we found that while other treatments are certainly expensive, Shkreli is committing a  equivalence when he compares them to Daraprim. Shkreli is right that other treatments can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars: for example, the cancer drug Revlimid can cost $150,000 per year while Kalydeco, a drug for cystic fibrosis, can cost $300,000 a year, according to the New York Times. By Shkreli’s calculations, the new price of treatment –100 pills of Daraprim for $750 a pop – is $75,000. But that’s a low estimate, according to the Infectious Disease Societies of America. It estimated a new annual cost of $336,000 to $634,000, depending on dosage. Beyond cancer and rare disease treatments, few drugs cost more than $100,000, said David Howard, a professor of health policy and management at Emory University. So the high price Shkreli cited ""isn’t a good benchmark for deciding whether a drug is underpriced,"" he said. Numbers aside, experts told us the real problem with Shkreli’s claim is Daraprim and cancer drugs shouldn’t be compared to each other. ""They're not peers,"" said Amir Attaran, a professor of health law and policy at the University of Ottawa. ""He could have said, ‘A bar of gold cost $1 million, so Daraprim is underpriced.’ He's comparing fish and fowl."" Simply put, cancer and rare disease drugs are almost always under patent, while Daraprim’s expired in 1953. And unlike Daraprim, those drugs are the products of expensive, recent research. ""The comparison is irrelevant. Cancer drugs were developed by companies that invested hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars in research and development,"" said John Lamattina, a former senior vice president at pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who currently writes about the industry for Forbes. Daraprim, meanwhile, ""is generic drug. There’s no research and development they had to do,"" said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health economics and finance at Johns Hopkins University. The research and development for Daraprim happened long before Shkreli bought the rights. It’s the trade name for pyrimethamine, a drug created by Nobel Prize-winning scientist Gertrude Elion that can be used to treat malaria as well as toxoplasmosis. Though no generic drug company has taken up manufacturing Daraprim (there are only about 2,000 U.S. patients who use the drug every year), it’s been available for reproduction for more than 60 years. That means its peers should be other generic drugs like ibuprofen, penicillin, and antibiotics, experts told us. The proposed 5,000 percent price increase on Daraprim is indicative of a larger trend among more niche generic drugs. A joint House and Senate investigation, partly led by Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, found that the annual cost hikes for 10 generic drugs ranged from 390 to 8,200 percent. This ""anarchy pricing"" can be attributed to the failure of the free market and a lack of government regulation, says Alan Sager, a professor of health policy and management at Boston University. ""Essentially, this is an example of where the drug pricing system for generic drugs has totally failed,"" Anderson said. ""In the past, generic drugs have prices that are low because of competition. Anyone can make it with FDA approval. The only thing you can compete on is price. (Shkreli’s) found something where there's no competitors."" Anyone can legally make Daraprim, but for the time being, Turing’s monopoly gives it free reign to impose very high prices. As for Shkreli’s claims that the profits will go to research for a better version of Daraprim, experts aren’t buying it. ""Turing has not got a single clinical trial underway. Shkreli’s not testing new drugs of any kind for toxoplasmosis. He's got nothing registered,"" Attaran said. ""No one needs a new drug for toxoplasmosis anyways. It works so well bloody well."" Our ruling Shkreli, the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, said, ""Daraprim is still underpriced, relative to its peers."" By his own estimates, Daraprim is cheaper than cancer and rare disease drugs, which he considers Daraprim’s ""peers."" By others, Daraprim costs about the same, if not more.

672,35257,March 2020 was the first March without a school shooting in the U.S. since 2002.,"April 16, 2020","What's true: According to one government database, the U.S. has had at least one shooting on K-12 school properties every March from 2003 through 2009, and every March since (but not including) 2010. What's false: However, the way that various U.S. government agencies and organizations define a ""school shooting"" varies greatly, making any numerical claims problematic. Also, by the standards of one key government database, the U.S. had eight — not zero — school shootings in March 2020.",Jessica Lee,"To prevent the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, state leaders across the U.S. ordered widespread school closures in March 2020. In the weeks that followed, millions of students spent their days at home instead of in classrooms. Some teachers and staff moved lessons online, and administrators locked the doors to school buildings so the general public could not enter. The closures were among the most dramatic steps by state leaders to combat the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 58,300 people globally as of this writing in mid-April 2020. About 56.6 million students registered for elementary or secondary school classes in the U.S. at the start of the 2019-20 academic year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. While a disruption to students’ learning, the shutdowns in America may have provided an unintended benefit, beyond limiting people’s exposure to the virus. On April 13, 2020, a journalist tweeted to his some 49,600 followers: “Last month was the first March without a school shooting in the United States since 2002.”  The reporter, Robert Klemko, quickly gained Twitter popularity among Americans who believe federal and state leaders should enact stricter gun laws, including former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “It shouldn’t have taken a pandemic to make this possible,” her Twitter account wrote in a retweet of Klemko’s post. Meanwhile, Facebook users shared screenshots of Klemko’s tweet, and one Instagram account for a website that brands itself as a fact-checking service on that platform posted a photograph of a law-enforcement officer monitoring students boarding a school bus with Klemko’s claim as overlay text. Among media sites, CBS News published a story stating the assertion as fact. “My teens said this is the first time they have relaxed. No need to be hyper vigilant of every unusual sound, can just focus on school work,” one person tweeted. “Both grew up with regular Active Shooter Drills since kindergarten.” The claim about school shootings since 2002 is twofold: It asserts that no school shootings occurred in the U.S. in March 2020 and that every March between 2003 and 2019 documented at least one such incident. But because agencies across government and the news media do not share a consistent way for tracking and defining school shootings, the truth of both assertions depends on whom you ask. The U.S. Secret Service and FBI, for example, provide an explanation of factors that contribute to school shootings but do not keep a running list of all on-campus gun crimes. Academics and school officials often rely on news media reports for their research, though journalists may not cover every shooting. The nation’s biggest guns-rights group, the National Rifle Association, does not publish a running tally of shootings in schools, yet it has convened researchers to compile recommendations on how to avoid such incidents, like other organizations. Meanwhile, a leading opponent of the NRA — the lobbyist group Everytown for Gun Safety — has tracked all “incidents of gunfire” in K-12 schools and colleges, including suicides; shootings in which no one suffered injuries; and cases where the victims or gunmen may not have any connection to the school, since 2013. Those prominent advocacy groups aside, the least partisan and most comprehensive source of school-shooting data appears to be the “K-12 School Shooting Database” sponsored by the U.S. Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Updated daily by emergency-management researchers, the database records “each and every instance in which a gun is brandished, fired, or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims, time of day, or day of week,” according to its stated methodology. Its website summarizes the tricky situation analyzing school-shooting data as follows: Without a common methodology for data collection, individual data sources are limited in both validity and utility. Furthermore, there is no consensus for what actually defines a school shooting … Based on the differences among all available reporting platforms, there is currently no single source for objective and accessible data from which school administrators, law enforcement, and public officials can draw to inform their decisions. With that as background, administrators of the CHDS-sponsored K-12 database documented eight incidents fitting its definition of a “school shooting” in March 2020. Local news media reports affirm those findings. The incidents include: Regarding the claim that March 2020 was the first March without a school shooting since 2002, the data is more murky. The CHDS-sponsored database lists at least one incident in U.S. K-12 schools in March of every year from 2003 through 2009, and every year from 2011 through 2020, but none in 2010. Supporting that finding, tallies of K-12 school shootings by the for-profit National School Safety and Security Services consulting firm and the advocacy group the National School Safety Center do not show a March 2010 incident. However, those sources only consider shootings on U.S. elementary, middle and high school properties. If you expand the scope of research to also include shootings on college campuses, Ohio State University documented a deadly shooting on March 9, 2010. According to the New York Times’ coverage of the incident, officials said a custodian of the school shot and killed a co-worker before killing himself in a maintenance building. Another person was wounded in the gunfire. We reached out to Washington Post reporter Klemko — the author of the viral claim — to understand where he got his numbers. He said he did include cases involving post-secondary institutions, rather than only focusing on K-12 schools.",false,"Politics, COVID-19"

But a week after the curbs were imposed, the disease is still spreading and hospitals in the north are at breaking point. The northern region of Lombardy, on the frontline of the battle against the respiratory pandemic, asked recently retired health workers on Wednesday to return to work and help colleagues overwhelmed by the crisis. “I make a heartfelt appeal to all the doctors, nurses and medical personnel who have retired in the last two years...to help us in this emergency,” regional Governor Attilio Fontana told a news conference. The national death toll surged by 475 over the past 24 hours, the largest increase in numerical terms since the outbreak first came to light on Feb. 21. The total number of confirmed cases grew by 4,207 to 35,713. “I believe that in the coming hours we will have to consider the possibility of a complete ban on outdoor activities,” Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora told state broadcaster RAI. The government lockdown banned all non-essential travel, but allowed people to take solitary daily exercise, if needed. Looking to enforce the restrictions, police have stopped more than one million people over the past week and booked almost 43,000 for violating the rules, the interior ministry said. “If the call to stay at home is not heeded, we will be forced to impose an absolute ban,” he said. The real number of deaths could be much higher than the official figure, after it emerged that fatalities in nursing homes - where dozens of patients are dying each day - are not being registered as coronavirus-related because none of the sick are being tested. “There are significant numbers of people who have died but whose death hasn’t been attributed to the coronavirus because...they weren’t swabbed,” said Giorgio Gori, mayor of the town of Bergamo, one of the worst hit areas. While many Italian cities have been largely empty over the past week, photographs have circulated on social media of public transport filling up in the financial capital Milan, suggesting that some people are going back to work. “Every time you leave your home, you are putting yourself and others at risk,” said Fontana. Lombardy, like many regions, is rushing to build makeshift hospitals to add badly needed intensive-care units. However, the move is being complicated by the fact that doctors, nurses and hospital porters are themselves falling sick. Some have died. The Gimbe Foundation research group, using data supplied by the national health authority, said that between March 11-17, some 2,529 health workers had been diagnosed with coronavirus - 8.3% of the national total of coronavirus cases. Officials warned that if the incidence of new cases did not slow in the coming days, they might extend the lockdown already in place, both in terms of the types of restrictions and how long they will continue. In successive decrees earlier this month, the government ordered restaurants, bars and most shops to close until March 25. In addition, it shut schools and universities and told everyone to stay home unless absolutely essential until April 3. Since the restrictions were most recently ramped up on March 12, the number of deaths has more than tripled. “I do not know if the measures will be extended beyond April 3. We will make a decision based on the numbers and events. I cannot rule it out. We will see in the coming days,” said Infrastructure Minister Paola De Micheli.",true,Health News

The CEOs at Davos have vowed to cut their use of plastic packaging through a range of initiatives, including a joint recycling scheme unveiled during the forum. But Greenpeace used that announcement to call for plastic packaging bans and a goal of “peak plastic”, saying recycling was not enough. About 8 million tonnes of plastic are dumped into oceans every year, killing marine life and entering the food chain, according to the U.N. Environment Program. Data like that, and TV shows such as documentary-maker David Attenborough’s Blue Planet, have taken the issue to the top of the summit agenda. Attenborough, 92, was honoured with a special award at the start of the annual event, where environmental concerns were a running theme alongside gloom and doom over the U.S.-China trade war and a slowdown in the global economy. “I sometimes wonder if we’re in the branded litter business, branded trash,” Unilever Chief Executive Alan Jope half-joked after he was asked during a panel debate if consumers were interested in the source of the company’s products. In 2017 at Davos, Dove soap maker Unilever promised to ensure all of its plastic packaging was recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. “Two years ago at Davos, Unilever was in front on plastics. At the moment it’s very high on our radar to do something about plastic waste above and beyond...the rest of the industry.”  Dozens of big companies have made various pledges to reduce plastic packaging, including a plan by 40 firms to eliminate unnecessary single-use plastic packaging in Britain by 2025. “We will roll out new tech next year that will reduce the amount of packaging per kilo,” PepsiCo Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta said at Davos, adding that Pepsi was trying to move more toward reusable cans and glass. PepsiCo, Unilever and European supermarket chains Carrefour (CARR.PA) and Tesco (TSCO.L) are among firms that signed up to the pilot waste-reduction programme unveiled in Davos this week. It will deliver products such as orange juice in reusable bottles to shoppers and pick up the empties for cleaning and re-use. “We can learn about the business model, and the consumer reaction to this and find solutions that last,” P&G’s Taylor said at the announcement. At one Davos panel debate, human rights lawyer Vivek Maru, founder of legal advocacy group Namati, asked PepsiCo’s Laguarta and the head of The Dow Chemical Company, Jim Fitterling, if they could be hit with lawsuits for the damage their companies had done, similar to litigation against the tobacco industry. “It’s a difficult question to answer,” Fitterling said. “The plastic waste got there through consumer behavior and people putting it out into the environment.”  The plastic debate has also caught the eye of the insurance industry, which has taken stands at times on environmental issues. Some major insurers refuse to provide cover for new coal-fired power stations due to climate-change concerns, for example. “It’s not a big reinsurance topic at this stage,” Christian Mumenthaler, who runs the world’s second-largest reinsurer Swiss Re (SRENH.S), told Reuters at Davos. “The mechanism where insurance would be involved would be on the liability policies of these companies. If the risk becomes very big and they get sued — not specifically plastic but any company — for their behavior, this would flow into our risk assessment and they could start to have trouble getting insurance,” he added. “It’s heating up very quickly and we are already seeing some action from companies, so let’s see. I would hope they would act quickly enough, radically enough to be a good case of change.”  Unilever and PespiCo chief executives bristled at Greenpeace’s call at Davos for more bans on plastic packaging, saying that the problem called for multiple solutions, from recycling and re-use to new packaging technologies. Last month, the European Union passed measures to ban throw-away plastic items such as straws and polystyrene cups by 2021. Greenpeace welcomed the move but called at the time for an EU-wide target to reduce consumption of food containers and cups. Greenpeace’s Morgan said the issue could not be solved through industry initiatives alone. “Many of the businesses behind these initiatives and others are expanding production of single-use plastic and are looking to grow in markets that can’t take more plastic,” Morgan said. “There’s a real risk that products like this become a distracting side show to generate positive (public relations).”  Brune Poirson, secretary of state for ecology, sustainable development and energy in France, also took a swipe at the companies, saying they should take the initiative. “Because you’re not doing that, we have to intervene,” Poirson said. “I think it’s a waste of time, a waste of resources and it’s not being a real responsible organization.”",true,Environment
676,28134,Liberal feminist Katie Hopkins advocated for driving euthanasia vans around to kill off the elderly.,"September 5, 2017","What's true: Hopkins did make the comment in an interview in 2015. What's false: The comments were not made in 2017, when the story was being shared on disreputable web sites; Hopkins is considered a right-wing commentator, not a ""liberal feminist"".",Bethania Palma,"On 29 August 2017, click bait web site WorldPoliticus.com, which regularly posts heavily sensationalized stories, reported that British media personality Katie Hopkins (who has made a name for herself by making outrageous comments) advocated for driving a van around with the purpose of euthanizing elderly people: Many people would gladly have Katie Hopkins removed from TV shows. The liberal British TV personality was part of The Apprentice, and made a shocking statement. Hopkins doesn’t really know how things work, and she better stop acting like an expert. The liberal supports the euthanasia of old people, and her excuse is the lamest thing you will ever hear. According to Hopkins, old people are nothing but a burden to society, and euthanasia is the only solution to her problem. She even suggested that communities should have “euthanasia vans” that would roll across the country and collect elderly people. Yes, this is the most disgusting thing I’ve ever heard. Hopkins, a tabloid columnist, did make the comments — but she did so two years ago, in an interview published on 6 August 2015 by the British program “Radio Times”. On the topic of elderly people and dementia, Hopkins had the following exchange with interviewer Michael Buerk: We’d been getting on terribly well, I thought. She’s smart, funny; attractive, too, in a beaky sort of way. She’d been rattling on, saying out loud the kind of things the rest of us feel guilty even thinking. She giggled a lot. I did a fair bit of sniggering myself, looking around furtively to make sure nobody was noticing. Then I made the mistake of asking the obvious question about her latest television venture, If Katie Hopkins Ruled the World… I couldn’t not ask her: well, OK, what would she do if she did? “Right,” she said, saucer blue eyes looking me up and down, evidently seeing a problem to be solved. “We just have far too many old people.” Did I know that one in three NHS beds was being blocked by the elderly and demented? A third of our hospitals filled up by people who don’t even know they’re there? She’d soon put a stop to that. “It’s ridiculous to be living in a country where we can put dogs to sleep but not people.” Her solution? “Easy. Euthanasia vans – just like ice-cream vans – that would come to your home.” After they’d finished in the hospitals, presumably. “It would all be perfectly charming. They might even have a nice little tune they’d play. I mean this genuinely. I’m super-keen on euthanasia vans. We need to accept that just because medical advances mean we can live longer, it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.” I stuttered something about not being entirely with her on this. “Not with me on that? Is it because you’re old?” I told you she was smart. Smart enough to be making a fair old living being rude about people, quite often to their faces. It’s a strange career for a conformist convent schoolgirl, whose first ambition was to join the Diplomatic Corps. Other than the perennial need for outrage-driven clicks, it’s unclear why the 2015 comments have been resurrected in 2017, but as of 5 September 2017, the story had been posted on several junk sites with no citation to the original interview. Hopkins is generally considered a right-wing commentator, per RationalWiki. Although it’s unclear what her true personally held views are, Hopkins has made a name for herself by “punching down”: Katie Hopkins is a writer-broadcaster, former British reality TV contestant and singularity of awfulness. She is known for her right-wing views expressed on television, newspapers, and on Twitter. She has been rude about migrants, Scots, Muslims, people with dementia, the lower classes, and many other individuals and groups. In fairness, it’s unclear how much of her output is designed to wind up the idiots who’ll complain about anything, how much is genuine hatred for those more needy than herself and how much is both. Hopkins now writes columns for a British tabloid, where she regularly rails against immigrants; Hopkins made headlines in mid-2017 when she was dragged by the rest of the UK press for traveling to Sicily and taking selfies with “Defend Europe”, a group of white supremacists who chartered a boat in an unsuccessful attempt to hamper non-governmental organizations like Doctors Without Borders from rescuing stranded migrants in danger of drowning in the Mediterranean Sea.",true,"Uncategorized, daily mail, fake outrage, katie hopkins"
677,9833,DHEA hormone may help women through menopause: study,"December 20, 2011","The scientists involved in this hormone study claim to have “robust evidence” of benefits for women’s sex lives but then also caution that the sample size is too small to be certain. We wish the story had taken a little more time to help readers decide what to believe and that it had included, in particular, information about costs and conflicts of interest. This is especially important given one of the researcher’s past histories with working closely with pharmaceutical companies to help them promote their products. Also, pulling quotes from a news release without attribution is not best practice. Hormone treatments are among the most litigated and most controversial drugs on the market. Readers need to understand the full context around any new development in hormone treatment, and they also need to understand what might be driving the science behind the scenes.","William Heisel,Karen Carlson, MD,Gary Schwitzer","Costs are missing from the story, and, given that these are well established products, cost information could have been explained. The story does a nice job specifically explaining the benefits or lack thereof. It says, “After 12 months, all the women on hormone replacements had improvements in menopausal symptoms, but those taking vitamin D and calcium did not show any significant improvement. At the start of the trial, all groups had similar sexual activity, but after the year, those taking calcium and vitamin D scored an average of 34.9 on the questionnaire scale, while those taking DHEA had a score of 48.6, showing that those on DHEA had more sexual interest and activity.” By presenting the actual scores, readers are able to see how close the scores were and decide for themselves whether the increased benefit was worth the risk of possible side effects. The story explains the potential harms involved in taking hormone treatments, saying, “sales of HRT drugs have fallen sharply since a large study in 2002 found higher rates of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and strokes in women who took the pills, and the search has since been on for alternatives.” But the story does not address any potential harms of DHEA, which was the subject of the story. The story signals up high that the study was limited in scope. It explains the basic study design quickly and competently. “For this trial, a team of researchers led by Andrea Genazzani of the University of Pisa followed a group of 48 post-menopausal women with troubling symptoms,” the story says. “Over a year, 12 women took vitamin D and calcium, 12 took DHEA, 12 took standard HRT and 12 took a synthetic steroid called tibolone which is used to alleviate menopausal symptoms.”  The story does not engage in disease mongering. The article does not quote any outside sources, which we know can be driven by deadline demands. The bigger problem with the story, and it’s a problem shared by many stories about hormone treatments, is that it does not acknowledge the authors’ conflicts of interest. Dr. Andrea Genazzini, for example, has worked with pharmaceutical companies on multiple articles that were ghostwritten by the companies’ marketing firms. You can find this by looking in the Drug Industry Document Archive. We know that it’s tough to cover all the bases when juggling multiple stories in a day, but we hope that more reporters will take the time to at least do a name check on researchers involved in studies of hormone therapy, antidepressants and other drugs that have been the subject of lawsuits and federal investigations. There is a wealth of information in the archive, and readers deserve to know more about it. The story mentions several alternative treatments to hormones. It says, “American researchers said in January that the antidepressant Lexapro, made by drugmaker Forest Laboratories, significantly cut the number and severity of hot flushes in menopausal women, and other antidepressants including GlaxoSmithKline’s Paxil and the Pfizer drugs Prozac and Effexor also have been found to be effective.” But it seems strange that the story refers only to these brand name products and does not mention any of the generic medications such as fluoxetine and citalopram that have also been proven to reduce hot flashes. This issue, and the lack of cost information, make this story less helpful to consumers than it might have been. The availability is implied, but the story could have been more explicit about how readers might purchase the specific drugs that were studied or whether they were in specific trial stages for this type of treatment. In fact, tibolone is not available in the U.S. though it is available in Europe. DHEA is sold as a supplement over the counter. There are no claims of novelty made here. The quotes in the story come from the press release issued by the journal (posted here by News Medical).",false,menopause
678,21520,"Joseph Cryan Says direct shipment of wine ""makes underage drinking as simple as a mouse click.","August 29, 2011",Assemblyman Joseph Cryan says direct shipment of wine would allow underage residents easy access to alcohol,Erin O'Neill,"You can do a lot of things with the click of a mouse. End a relationship. Destroy a career. Forward funny pet videos to your friends. Add get alcohol when you’re underage to the list of possibilities if a bill allowing wineries to ship directly to New Jersey consumers becomes law, said Assemblyman Joseph Cryan (D-Union). Cryan wrote an op-ed criticizing legislation in the state Senate  that would allow direct shipment of wine. Cryan has sponsored a bill that would amend the state’s licensing laws for wineries but does not allow direct shipping. And the debate over shipping wine is certain to raise at least one concern: underage drinking. ""Direct shipment provides a virtual store for teens to buy alcohol they would otherwise be prohibited from buying at liquor stores. It makes the face-to-face purchase transaction practically irrelevant; and makes underage drinking as simple as a mouse click,"" Cryan wrote in an op-ed posted on CourierPostOnline.com on Aug. 21. Can the under-21 crowd get drunk with the click of a mouse? PolitiFact New Jersey found it’s not that easy. Cryan’s deputy chief of staff, Dave Jenkins, sent PolitiFact New Jersey a 2005 report from an arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to support the claim. The report said ""the Internet acts as a general store"" where teenagers can ""get hold of almost anything,"" including beer, wine and liquor, but also marijuana, prescription drugs and ""crack dealer locator services."" Though the report raises concerns about what teenagers can access online, it does not address underage consumers ordering wine through a licensed winery. A 2003 study by the Federal Trade Commission and a 2010 report from the Comptroller of Maryland -- that noted the difficulty of proving a cause and effect relationship in this case -- found little to no evidence of an increase in underage drinking due to direct shipment of wine. The Maryland report said, ""The reasons for this may be that: (1) ""wine"" is not the drink of choice for youth; and (2) direct shipment of wine is costly and time-consuming."" Jenkins called the Maryland report ""useless"" because its conclusion ""only recognizes the need for a better method of evaluation."" Other studies show, and experts said, that underage consumers looking for alcohol probably aren’t going to buy wine. An April report in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and a 2006 report by Columbia University’s National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse both concluded that wine is not the first choice for underage drinkers. Marilyn Aguirre-Molina, professor of clinical population and family health at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, said, ""teens are going online for everything imaginable, but something like alcohol -- which requires a credit card, an address to mail it too, as well as patience until it arrives -- online purchase of wine is a drag and hassle, especially if it’s the least preferred of alcoholic beverages."" Even if someone younger than 21 wanted to order a bottle of wine and successfully placed that order online, Cryan’s claim starts to unravel when the product is packaged. FedEx and UPS require packages containing wine to be labeled, saying they contain alcoholic beverages. Also, both companies require the signature of an adult 21 or older upon delivery. The U.S. Postal Service does not ship wine. Cryan’s deputy chief of staff said it’s lawmakers’ responsibility to ensure underage individuals do not get access to alcohol. ""We cannot depend upon the policies of FedEx, or others to properly deny those underage from delivery. We must be proactive, not reactive. What if FedEx changes their policy tomorrow?"" he wrote in an email. Joanne Tetlow, a division staff attorney with the Comptroller of Maryland's field enforcement division who compiled the agency’s report on direct wine shipment, said since ""we don’t license consumers like we do retailers"" states that allow direct shipment of wine are relying on the shipping companies. And there is a chance those measures will fail. ""Do we believe it represents a threat? Absolutely,"" said Michael Scippa, public affairs director for Alcohol Justice, a California-based industry watchdog. He said age verification online and by delivery companies are ""two areas where it seems easy to or possible to bypass the law."" The ruling  Cryan claimed that allowing wineries to ship their product directly to consumers makes ""underage drinking as simple as a mouse click."" But even if an underage individual can order a bottle of wine online, the two major shipping companies in the U.S. require an adult signature in order to deliver the package. Cryan’s claim exaggerates a legitimate concern, but we can’t ignore the hint of truth in the statement -- that shipping wine directly to homes provides another opportunity for underage access.

Days earlier, CNN reported that Melbourne City police found a brick of cocaine on a beach after a beach-goer reported it as a “suspicious package.” The officer had the package’s contents tested and confirmed that they were cocaine:  A beachgoer found the drugs, pointing out a “suspicious package” to a patrol officer monitoring the beach, Melbourne city spokeswoman Cheryl Mall told CNN. The officer took the package into custody, and the contents were tested, confirming the cocaine. This brick of cocaine was found a few days after law enforcement discovered another stash of cocaine on Cocoa Beach. Local news outlet Florida Today reported that officers found a duffel bag containing 15 kilos of cocaine worth about $300,000: Cocoa Beach police are asking beachcombers in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian to be cautious about suspicious packages after a duffel bag stuffed with 15 kilos of cocaine washed ashore over. The find — worth at least $300,000 — came before Dorian’s violent stirrings in the Atlantic led to a single brick of cocaine being found along a beach in Melbourne. “There is a possibility that more will come onshore. Especially now with these conditions. It could be coming from anywhere,” said Manny Hernandez, spokesman for the Cocoa Beach Police Department. “We’re telling people to be cautious and not to grab or handle it because if there is an opening, it can go into your pores and you can overdose,” he said. Cocoa Beach Police Sgt. Manny Hernandez told us that this duffel bag of cocaine was found “pre-Hurricane Dorian” on Aug. 30, 2019. It’s unclear if these two packages were connected. However, as some of the cocaine washed ashore prior to the hurricane.  Here are the facts regarding the cocaine that washed up in Cocoa Beach (Pre-hurricane Dorian): On Friday, August 30, 2019 (pre-hurricane Dorian) at approximately 17:16 (5:16pm), Cocoa Beach Police responded to the Beach End of S. 6th St, Cocoa Beach, FL., in reference to a suspicious package that washed up on shore. The red, travel style duffle bag, was noticed by a beach goer who immediately contacted the police department as the bag appeared suspicious. Responding officers believed the duffle bag contained illegal substance and properly removed it from the beach and transported the bag to the Cocoa Beach Police Department. Upon further inspection, the bag contained 15 small “bricks” that were tightly packaged. However, it was believed the packages may contain an unknown narcotic, possibly cocaine. Cocoa Beach Police contacted the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency and notified them of the suspicious bag and contents. A representative/Agent with the agency responded to the Cocoa Beach Police Department the same evening. U.S. Custom and Border Protection Agent inspected the packages and after removing several layers off one of the “Bricks”, the Agent informed the substance to be cocaine. It is unknown who the duffle bags belongs to and unknown where the cocaine is from. There were no further incidents involving the duffle bag. The bag and the 15 “Bricks” (1 Kilo per brick) was turned over to U.S Custom & Border Protection Agent. The street value in the central Florida area is approximately $20K – $30K per “Brick” (Kilo). While these news reports may seem unusual, these incidents were not the first time drugs had washed ashore in Florida.

Earl Blumenauer says cutting direct subsidies to farmers would save $28.4 billion over 10 years,Charles Pope,"With Congress’ tendency to sidestep the really difficult questions on spending and deficits, even old statements remain relevant and worthy of examination. That’s what happens when the country is governed in two-month increments. So once again Congress is sweating mandatory, across-the-board spending cuts called ""the sequester"" unless they are able to intervene between now and March 1. And yes, the matter was supposed to be settled. It remains because Congress enacted only a temporary fix. So for PolitiFact fact checkers everywhere, we express our bemused but sincere thanks for the budgetary gift that keeps on giving. It’s also the reason a statement Rep. Earl Blumenauer made in December is still relevant as Congress looks at ways to avoid $109 billion in automatic spending cuts that begin in March. ""This is why I've worked to end the wasteful direct payment farm subsidy program that funnels payments to large corporate agribusinesses. This action could save up to $28.4 billion over ten years that could be used to reduce the deficit,"" the Oregon Democrat said in a Dec. 21, 2012, news release. That’s a lot of money at a time when Congress is desperate for big numbers. But is the number real? Let’s take a look. Trimming back or totally eliminating farm subsidies is one of the most popular ideas for cutting federal spending. President Barack Obama called for eliminating them in 2011, at a savings of $5 billion a year. Blumenauer has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the payments that provide  federal dollars to recipients. The payments pour forth, according to the taxpayer watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, ""regardless of current crop prices, and there’s not even a requirement these crops actually be grown on the land receiving payments."" It’s time to change, Blumenauer says, especially now when farm incomes are near record highs and the blunt, inefficient nature of the subsidies qualifies even rich ""city slickers"" such as investment CEO Charles Schwab for payments. It’s not isolated. Five hundred fifty-one people with Portland addresses collected farm subsidies totaling $2.8 million in 2010, the Environmental Working Group found using federal records. Those recipients are part of an agriculture ""safety net"" erected in 1996 that, in this case, provides payments to farmers (both genuine and hobby) who raise wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, cotton and peanuts. The Congressional Budget Office calculated that ending those subsidies would save $28.4 billion over 10 years. Blumenauer wants that money diverted from what he says are stable and profitable companies to paying down the nation’s $1.1 trillion deficit. The politics are jumbled since legislation that would trim direct payments passed the Senate last year but never came to a vote in the House. But the number is solid. It was generated by the Congressional Budget Office at the request of then-Rep. (and now Sen.) Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who introduced legislation in 2011 to eliminate direct payments to farmers. If you need help breaking the code, direct payments are federal payments made to qualifying producers ""paid at a set rate every year regardless of conditions."" The merits of the program can be debated and the politics will remain tangled. But just as farmers return to the field every spring and seeds sprout into crops by summer, Blumenauer’s numbers are certain and correct. For that reason, we are this claim: .",true,"Agriculture, Oregon, Federal Budget, Earl Blumenauer, "
687,9259,Asthma gene's effect on respiratory symptoms in infancy depends on breastfeeding status,"September 13, 2016","The release describes research into a possible link between breastfeeding and infants having a genetic predisposition to asthma. Researchers drew data from medical records on respiratory symptoms and breastfeeding status and compared them with genotype data gathered from study participants. It claims a 27 percent relative risk reduction among predisposed infants who were breastfed compared to those who weren’t, but we have no other data points, no absolute risk reduction information. The release doesn’t provide enough information for readers to be assured that other factors did not play a role in the results. Reviewers (and presumably other interested readers) were unable to access the actual research paper, or an abstract online, at the time of the review. [Editor’s note. Several days after reaching out to the issuing organization, an abstract on the study was provided, but it did not change the outcome of the review.] The relationship between genetic variance and environmental factors in the eventual development of asthma is not crystal clear. Asthma appears to have a strong genetic predisposition. A child with a parent with asthma is three-to-six times more likely to develop asthma than other children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If breastfeeding infants predisposed to asthma could actually reduce their risk of respiratory symptoms by a quarter or more, then that would be a substantial improvement, both to individual and to public health, especially given the growing proportion of children developing asthma and other respiratory problems.","Earle Holland,Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Kathlyn Stone","There are two aspects to this release: a genetic mutation which predisposes to asthma and the potential value of breastfeeding in reducing that risk. The release makes no mention of costs in explaining this research. While on the surface breastfeeding carries no economic burden, genetic testing does. The release does not provide any information (as we will note later) about the availability of genetic testing or whether insurance coverage is available. It’s difficult to quantify, but breastfeeding can have financial costs. There is growing awareness that breastfeeding does exact a toll in time and related earning potential, as explained in this New York Times article. The release states that “during the weeks that infants were breastfed, those carrying the asthma risk genotypes, had a 27 percent decreased relative risk of developing respiratory symptoms.” To which we respond: 27 percent of what? We still have no understanding of what the change in absolute risk actually is, a data point that readers deserve and can better use. The release also says that “When infants were not breastfed, those carriers exhibited a trend towards an increased risk of respiratory symptoms,” but provides no data to define that “increased risk” or their perceived “trend.” Harms associated with breastfeeding are admittedly few and far between. Infrequently, a mother may transfer environmental contaminants to a breastfeeding infant. However, the risks associated with genetic testing in general and the association between the chromosomal variant on chromosome 17, called 17q21, and the risk of the development of asthma are not covered. How reliable is the test? Is over- or under-diagnosis a risk factor? How likely is it that the child may eventually develop asthma? How many children with the variant develop asthma? The first statement in this release says that, “Infants who have a genetic profile linked with asthma risk could be protected against respiratory symptoms if they are breastfeed.” But that demonstrative statement exceeds what the design of this study could show — that infants predisposed to asthma can be protected by breastfeeding. Such proof would require a study designed differently than this one. At best, this study may show a correlation between breastfeeding and reduced asthma risk. It cannot show that breastfeeding reduces that risk. There is no disease mongering here. However, we would have liked to have seen some information in the release about the prevalence of asthma in the developed and developing world. The release provides no information as to the funders of this research, nor does it provide any information on possible conflicts of interest involving the researchers, only one of which is mentioned in the release. Additionally, neither the abstract nor the full research paper was available when the news release was published, so other information describing the research was unavailable. There was no information provided pertaining to possible alternatives to breastfeeding that also might lead to a reduced risk of asthma among infants, even though there is a wealth of information linking numerous environmental factors to the exacerbation of asthma. A recent review article names more than 100 genetic variants have been associated with the development of asthma along with a host of environmental factors. Breastfeeding is indeed routinely available but the availability of genetic testing for the chromosome 17q21 variant is not described. Is this test generally available and if so, is it covered by insurance? The release doesn’t say. The release claims that “Our study is the first to show that breastfeeding can modify the effect of asthma-related genetic profiles on respiratory symptoms in the first year of life.” Research into the role of genetics in the development of asthma has been ongoing for years, so there is really nothing novel about this research in that regard. If this research could actually show a protective connection between breastfeeding and infants’ reduced risk of asthma, then that surely would qualify as novel enough to warrant a news release.

689,29598,"A mandatory gun ownership law in Kennesaw, Georgia, caused the town's crime rate to plummet.","October 9, 2015","Another aspect to consider is whether Kennesaw’s crime rates were observed elsewhere in the state. In the decade bracketing the law’s passage (1976 through 1986) there was a significant drop in murders, burglaries, property crimes, the property crime rate, and the burglary rate in Georgia as whole (despite Kennesaw’s outlier status with the gun law in question). Statewide, the murder rate similarly dropped in a fairly dramatic fashion after 1982 without a statewide law requiring gun ownership.",Kim LaCapria,"A mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, revived interest in a number of memes about gun control, among them the above-reproduced claim involving the town of Kennesaw, Georgia. According to the graphic shown here, Kennesaw mandated gun ownership for all households in 1982, and as a result, local crime rates dropped dramatically. But even the most basic element of the claim, about the imposition of mandatory gun ownership in that town, wasn’t quite true. The law in question stated: Sec. 34-21. – Heads of households to maintain firearms. (a) In order to provide for the emergency management of the city, and further in order to provide for and protect the safety, security and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants, every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm, together with ammunition therefore. (b) Exempt from the effect of this section are those heads of households who suffer a physical or mental disability which would prohibit them from using such a firearm. Further exempt from the effect of this section are those heads of households who are paupers or who conscientiously oppose maintaining firearms as a result of beliefs or religious doctrine, or persons convicted of a felony. In other words, Kennesaw residents were required to own guns … save for those Kennesaw residents who couldn’t afford guns, couldn’t use guns, couldn’t legally own guns, or simply didn’t want to have guns. Essentially, Kennesaw residents were never actually required to own guns, making most assertions about mandatory gun ownership and crime rates in that town highly problematic. That law was a direct response to a (since repealed) ban on the possession of handguns that was implemented in Morton Grove, Illinois, in 1981. An important point of distinction between the two examples was that Morton Grove’s was enforceable while Kennesaw’s was largely symbolic and was never intended to be enforced. The latter, therefore is clearly not an exceptionally good indicator of the effect of such a mandate on crime statistics. As Kennesaw Police Department’s Lt. Craig Graydon explained, gun ownership wasn’t truly compulsory in Kennesaw (nor was it ever intended to be):  Kennesaw’s 1982 gun mandate was a direct response to a gun ban enacted a year earlier in Morton Grove, Illinois. That was later deemed unconstitutional, but Kennesaw’s law is still on the books. Added Lt. Graydon, “It was not meant to be an enforceable law. The police department has never searched homes to make sure you had a gun. It was meant more or less as a political statement to support citizens’ second amendment rights to own firearms.” Homeowners in Kennesaw who don’t buy a gun are not punished. In fact, there are several exemptions, including religious objections, if someone is a convicted felon, has a mental illness or simply can’t afford a weapon. Lt. Graydon’s sentiment was also expressed in an April 1987 New York Times article: Mayor Stephenson says that in the five years since the gun ordinance was adopted the city has never prosecuted anyone for refusing to keep a gun. Officials concede that the ordinance is, for all intents, unenforceable. “We’re not interested in searching people’s houses,” said the Mayor. “Mostly, what we wanted to do was make a statement, to make people sit up and take notice. And they did, and we’re proud of that.” Much of the claim hinged on the passage of time for plausibility. Hard statistics for the crime rate in a small Georgia city before 1982 were difficult to come by in 2015 (more than three decades later), but the author of a 18 March 1982 New York Times editorial titled “The Guns of Kennesaw” squeezed those numbers from the initially “reticent” Mayor Darvin Purdy and Chief of Police Robert Ruble: The jovial officials turn more reticent when talk turns to crime statistics in their community of 7,000. Chief Ruble says overall crime in 1981 was up 16 percent from 1980. But you have to ask to find out the details. Armed robberies did soar — from one in 1980 to four in 1981. Homicides declined, from two in 1980 to none in 1981. Soon afterwards, the narrative claiming a reduction in crime had begun to develop (even as Mayor Stephenson conceded he had no idea how many residents newly became gun owners because of the law): “In 1981, the year before the ordinance was adopted, Kennesaw recorded 55 house burglaries. The next year there were 26, and in 1985 only 11.” As the news excerpt referenced above indicated, a drop in homicides owing to a mandatory gun ownership law would be difficult to measure, as the number of murders that took place in Kennesaw the year prior to the law’s implementation was zero and therefore could drop no lower. And the increased number of armed robberies from 1980 (one) to 1981 (four) represented a sample so low that a subsequent reduction in such crime didn’t provide any meaningful data from which a conclusion about “mandatory” gun ownership and crime rates could be drawn.",false,Politics Guns

Authorities announced restrictions on movement of traffic and people overnight from Thursday until Sunday for the disinfection drive. The restrictions will last from 8 p.m. (1600 GMT) to 6 a.m.  Only essential service workers would be allowed out and violators will face fines, a security forces spokesman said in a press conference on Thursday. Public transport including trams and metro services will be suspended, while private cars, cabs and delivery vehicles can operate outside those hours. The UAE has slowly followed other Gulf states in suspending passenger flights and closing public venues such as restaurants and malls. Dubai emirate on Wednesday directed the private sector to implement remote working for most staff but exempted a broad spectrum of businesses. On Thursday, the UAE government ordered all federal ministries and establishments and the private sector to limit the number of staff in offices to 30%. It exempted sectors providing essential services including health, finance, energy, telecoms, security, military, cargo and food. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have taken the most drastic steps, including imposing partial nationwide curfews and suspending work at most public and private sector establishments. Kuwait on Thursday banned all taxis, directed the state supply company to cover any basic food shortages and said it would disburse a month’s salary to all Kuwaiti students abroad. The number of cases in Saudi Arabia passed 1,000 after authorities on Thursday announced 112 new infections, most of them in the capital Riyadh and the holy city of Mecca. They also reported a third death from the virus, a resident in Medina who had suffered from chronic diseases. Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar also saw more cases, taking the total in the six Gulf states to over 2,600, with nine deaths. Saudi Arabia has released 250 foreign detainees held on non-violent immigration and residency offences as part of efforts to contain the spread of the disease, the state-backed Human Rights Commission said on Thursday. Bahrain and Kuwait have also announced prisoner releases. Bahrain continued to evacuate several hundred Bahraini pilgrims stranded in Iran, which is an epicentre for the disease in the region. A second repatriation flight of around 60 Bahrainis arrived overnight from the holy Shi’ite Iranian city of Mashhad, operated by Iranian airline Kish, families and a Bahraini official told Reuters. Bahrain earlier this month repatriated 165 people, but a number of subsequent scheduled flights were cancelled. At least 85 of the first batch of evacuees tested positive for the virus. The island state, which has reported 419 coronavirus cases and four deaths, most of them linked to travel to Iran, has longstanding differences with Iran and has criticised the Islamic Republic for not stamping Bahraini citizens’ passports.

694,18823,States have cumulatively cut over $1.8 billion from their mental health services between 2009 and 2011. This is the largest reduction in state mental health services in half a century.,"February 1, 2013",Rep. Marcy Kaptur says states have slashed funding for mental health services,Sabrina Eaton,"As funerals proceeded for the 20 first-graders and six school employees massacred on Dec. 14, by a gunman at Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary School, members of Congress including Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur took to the House of Representatives floor to decry the violence. Kaptur’s speech highlighted cuts in mental health funding during the recession, while urging a ""more constructive federal role in assuring proper and early diagnosis and intervention of affected youth and appropriate treatment."" During her speech, Kaptur said that ""states have cumultatively cut over $1.8 billion from their mental health services between 2009 and 2011. This is the largest reduction in state mental health services in half a century."" PolitiFact Ohio took a look at the numbers. Kaptur specifically cited the National Alliance on Mental Illness during her speech as a source of information. Her spokesman said she was citing data from a report the mental health advocacy group released in March 2011, after a paranoid schizophrenic gunman shot then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed six others in a supermarket parking lot outside Tucson, Ariz. The report observed that ""the public often focuses on mental illness only when high visibility tragedies of the magnitude of Tucson or Virginia Tech occur."" ""Between 2009 and 2011, states cumulatively cut more than $1.8 billion from their budgets for services for children and adults living with mental illness,"" it continued. The report said that cuts during that period kept thousands of Ohioans with serious mental illness from accessing care in their communities, resulting in their living on the streets, or ending up in more expensive settings like jails and hospitals. The NAMI report stressed that people living with mental illness are, on the whole, no more violent than the rest of the population and are more frequently the victims of violence than perpetrators of violent acts. But it said the ""risks of violence among a small subset of individuals may increase when appropriate treatment and supports are not available."" In an email, NAMI spokesman Bob Carolla noted the 2011 report that Kaptur cited was based on funding information available from states at the time the report was issued. The National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors subsequently determined that total cuts were much higher than the figures cited in the NAMI report - $4.35 billion between 2009 and 2012. ""The economic downturn has forced state budgets to cut approximately $4.35 billion in public mental health spending over the 2009-2012 period – the largest combined reduction since de-institutionalization,"" says a March 2012 report from the mental health program directors group. A year-by-year breakdown in that report says that $1.22 billion in was cut in FY 2009 in the 39 states that provided statistics to the organization; that $1.02 billion was cut in FY 2010 by 38 states, that $1.27 billion was cut in FY 2011 by 36 states, and $842 million was cut in FY 2012 by 31 states. Carolla said his organization accepts the accuracy of the mental health program directors group’s figures. He noted that de-institutionalization, which shifted mental health care from institutions like mental hospitals to community-based settings, ""is generally considered to have begun with the passage of legislation under President Kennedy in 1963 - 50 years ago."" That coincides with the half-century timeline cited in Kaptur’s speech. When asked for details on the comparison of current cuts with those that happened when de-institutionalization occurred, representatives of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors said their funding statistics go back only 30 years. While they believe the statement about the cuts’ scope is probably correct, they can’t precisely compare the deinstitutionalization era’s budgetary cuts with today’s numbers. ""It is by far the biggest cut in 30 years, but before that, the data doesn’t exist in a format where I can look at it and say it is apples to apples,"" says Ted Lutterman, the director of research analysis for the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. He said he did not provide the information on deinstitutionalization that Kaptur cited, and said that someone else must have inserted that tidbit into the group’s report. Robert Glover, who heads the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research, also could not provide details on the half-century figure that Kaptur cited, though he said the recent budget cuts are the largest he’s seen during his 40 years in the profession. He calls the $4.35 billion statistic that his group uses  ""very conservative"" because it omits numbers from several states that didn’t provide the group with their budget figures. He observed that mental health needs rise when financial problems fester in a sour economy and that mental health service cuts make it harder for those with difficulties to get the help they need. Glover says Ohio has provided a bright spot amid the cuts, developing programs designed to integrate mental health care with physical health care. ""There are pockets of restoration in some states,"" Glover said. Ohio Department of Mental Health Communications Director Trudy Sharp said her organization’s general revenue budget went down by $67 million between the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years, then increased by $20 million in the 2011 fiscal year. She said her department trimmed its central office staff by 20 percent since 2008, and also shuttered three of the state’s nine psychiatric hospitals. Facilities in Cambridge, Cleveland and Dayton were closed and their beds absorbed by other hospitals, she said. Additionally, she said Ohio is consolidating its Department of Mental Health with its Department of Alcohol and Drug Addiction services, and trying to stretch its mental health dollars by encouraging regional planning approaches between counties. So where does all this leave Kaptur’s statement? Kaptur accurately cited statistics about mental health budget cuts from a National Alliance on Mental Illness report. Those numbers appear to have downplayed the extent of cuts. But, her claim that ""over $1.8 billion"" was cut between 2009 and 2011 is accurate because the cuts surely exceeded $1.8 billion. Her contention that the cuts mark the ""largest reduction in state mental health services in half a century,"" is harder to prove. She based her statement on information in a report produced by an often-cited authority on state mental health funding. While representatives of the group said they believe that statement is accurate, they acknowledged they didn’t have state funding numbers going back 50 years to document that assertion. That’s a point of clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, her claim rates .",true,"Ohio, Health Care, Guns, Marcy Kaptur, "
698,8384,Spain's PM to seek longer but more flexible lockdown.,"April 18, 2020","Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday he would ask parliament for a 15-day extension until May 9 of the lockdown imposed in one of the world’s worst coronavirus’ outbreaks, but said the restrictions would be more flexible.","Joan Faus, Graham Keeley","“We have left behind the most extreme moments,” Sanchez said at a press briefing. But he added: “These achievements are still insufficient and above all fragile. We cannot put them at risk with hasty solutions”. Spain’s death toll from the coronavirus rose at a slower pace on Saturday but surpassed 20,000 fatalities, the Health Ministry said. It increased by 565 deaths, down from 585 on Friday, while the number of coronavirus cases rose to 191,726 from 188,068. Spain began this week to ease a strict lockdown imposed on March 14 by opening up some sectors of the economy, including manufacturing. But most people are still confined to their homes except for essential outings such as food shopping, and not even children are allowed out for exercise. The country with the third highest coronavirus death toll will move slowly, carefully and progressively towards the “new normality”, Sanchez said. But he warned it would be a complex task and that the economic consequences of the outbreak will be “very negative”. Asked if citizens would be able to have regular summer holidays, the Socialist leader said he hoped so but that he could not give an answer, signalling the uncertainty on the scope of any de-escalation phase. As he seeks a third parliamentary extension of the state of emergency, the next lockdown phase could start being “asymmetric” on April 27, meaning it could be more relaxed for some regions or groups, Sanchez said, without specifying. For instance, children would be allowed out of their homes though it would be “limited and subject to conditions to avoid contagion,” Sanchez said. The prime minister plans to define the criteria in coming days, including in a meeting on Sunday with Spain’s 17 regional leaders. Despite stressing an improvement in the figures and defending his government’s measures, Sanchez said Western countries “reacted late” to the virus’ outbreak. He also admitted Spain could not initially provide all the protective equipment needed for its health workers. The health ministry plans to announce an order on Sunday to control and fix the prices of masks for citizens, Sanchez said. Health emergency chief Fernando Simon earlier said he hoped to see soon a steeper decrease in the number of coronavirus deaths. Simon said he expected a significant rise in registered coronavirus cases as the number of quick tests conducted has doubled in the past three weeks, but stressed that the tests have shown a lower infection rate among citizens. Spain’s labour minister Yolanda Diaz said on Friday her department was planning a two-phased economic resumption, the first for productive sectors up to the summer and a second for tourism and leisure which would last until the end of the year.

699,8574,WHO rejects 'China-centric' charge after Trump criticism.,"April 8, 2020","World Health Organization officials on Wednesday denied that the body was “China-centric” and said that the acute phase of a pandemic was not the time to cut funding, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he may put contributions on hold.",Emma Farge,"The United States is the top donor to the Geneva-based body which Trump said had issued bad advice during the new coronavirus outbreak. U.S. contributions to WHO in 2019 exceeded $400 million, almost double the 2nd largest country donor, according to figures from the U.S. State Department. China contributed $44 million, it said. “We are still in the acute phase of a pandemic so now is not the time to cut back on funding,” Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, told a virtual briefing when asked about Trump’s remarks. Trump told a news conference on Tuesday that the United States was “going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO,” however, he appeared to backtrack later when in response to questions he said: “We’re going to look at it.”  It was not immediately clear how Trump could “block” funding for the organization. Under U.S. law, Congress, not the president, decides how federal funds are spent. Dr Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to the WHO Director-General, also defended the U.N. agency’s relationship with China, saying its work with Beijing authorities was important to understand the outbreak which began in Wuhan in December. “It was absolutely critical in the early part of this outbreak to have full access to everything possible, to get on the ground and work with the Chinese to understand this,” he told reporters. “This is what we did with every other hard-hit country like Spain and had nothing to do with China specifically.”  Aylward, who led a WHO expert mission to China in February, defended WHO recommendations to keep borders open, saying that China had worked “very hard” to identify and detect early cases and their contacts and ensure they did not travel. “China worked very, hard very early on, once it understood what it was dealing with, to try and identify and detect all potential cases to make sure that they got tested to trace all the close contacts and make sure they were quarantined so they actually knew where the virus was, where the risk was,” he said. “Then they made it very clear that these people would not and could not travel within the country, let alone internationally,” he added. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been lavish in his praise of China from early in the outbreak, praising President Xi Jinping’s “rare leadership”. David Heymann, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who led WHO’s response to the 2003 SARS outbreak, said that any U.S. funding cut would be a huge blow. “If the WHO loses its funding it cannot continue to do its work. It works on a shoe-string budget already,” Heymann said in London. “Of course it would be disastrous for the WHO to lose funding.”",true,Health News
701,2915,Florida researchers developing football helmets to reduce concussions.,"January 8, 2014",Researchers in Florida believe they have come up with a low-cost way to improve football helmets and better protect players against the glancing blows that experts say contribute to most concussions.,Barbara Liston,"Protective sports helmets on the market today are largely designed to absorb shock from direct linear hits, like head butts, which force the head straight back, says University of Florida (UF) engineering professor Ghatu Subhash. But Subhash’s new strategy makes use of fluid-filled pouches that, his tests show, also protect the brain from the rotational or shearing force of off-center hits on helmets. “The fluid-filled cells within the helmet respond, so no matter the angle of impact, the helmet automatically protects any part of the head,” said Subhash, who came up with the idea while working on improving helmets and body armor for the military. Subhash, along with his collaborators - UF neurosurgeon Ian Heger and UF radiologist Keith Peters - is set to unveil the safer helmet on Thursday. He will demonstrate its effectiveness on January 20 for venture capitalists, who could fund wider scale testing and manufacturing. Subhash said he hopes to have low-cost pouches suitable for retrofitting existing helmets available in stores within two years. The pouches also can be used in helmets for the military, firefighters and constructions workers, he said. A growing body of academic research shows the repeated hits to the head to which football players are subjected can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a condition linked to the loss of decision-making control, aggression and dementia. The National Football League agreed last year to pay more than $760 million to settle a lawsuit brought by more than 4,500 former players. Subhash said cushions and water- or air-filled pouches typically have been used to help protect against linear blows. But to blunt shearing or rotational forces, he adds pouches filled with non-Newtonian fluids, which he says increase resistance when stressed. Think kids’ Flubber or Silly Putty, which can flow or break depending on stress, or chilled caramel ice cream topping which is easily spoonable yet stays put in an overturned jar. Non-Newtonian fluids also are used in some modern automobile shock absorbers, Subhash said. Subhash said when one of his fluid-filled cells is struck, the fluid squeezes through a tube into a second cell, thus neutralizing the force. The fluid then returns to its original cell, making the pouches reusable. Concern over the long-term impact of blows to the head has created a market for expensive helmets that claim to protect players from concussions. “There are no helmets that will protect against concussions,” said Frederick Mueller, research director for the standard-setting body, National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment. “Helmet manufactures may say that, but none at the present time protect against concussion injuries,” he said. Mueller’s organization has warned about the limitations of the testing used in a popular 5-Star helmet rating system created by Virginia Tech, including the lack of consideration of rotational forces. “Many people believe that the rotational forces are more important than linear when you talk about concussions,” Mueller said.",true,Health News

NARAL has advocated for Democratic moderators to ask about abortion, including a campaign on Twitter #AskAboutAbortion. Before the New York debate, NARAL sent a letter to CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer urging him to ask about abortion. Renee Bracey Sherman, a board member at NARAL, wrote a column for Glamour posted the day of the New York debate that argued that even though they both support abortion, there are questions that should be asked about their positions: ""Will abortion be covered in Sanders’ Medicare-For-All plan? How will Clinton direct the Department of Justice to respond to the record number of attacks on providers? Will their administration step in to stop the prosecution of those who are self inducing their abortions? How will the candidates stop states from closing abortion clinics? Will their immigration policy ensure undocumented people are able to access abortion care? How will they ensure everyone is able to access safe, affordable abortion care in their community?"" There was a town hall, however, where the moderator brought up abortion, a spokesman for Clinton told us. In a Fox News town hall March 7, moderator Brett Baier asked Sanders and Clinton questions about abortion. Baier asked Sanders: ""Can you name a single circumstance at any point in a pregnancy in which you would be OK with abortion being illegal?"" Sanders replied: ""I happen to believe that it is wrong for the government to be telling a woman what to do with her own body."" He then posed a similar question to Clinton: ""Do you think a child should have any legal rights or protections before it's born? Or do you think there should not be any restrictions on any abortions at any stage in a pregnancy?"" Clinton replied that she supports abortion rights. ""I have been on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother,"" she said.

703,9193,The best treatment for laryngeal cancer? This approach helps decide,"February 13, 2017","The release focuses on recent research published in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery. The research assessed the effectiveness of a treatment technique for laryngeal cancer that exposed patients with advanced (stage 3 or 4) cancer to a one-time chemotherapy treatment that, theoretically, would allow physicians to determine whether patients were responding well to chemotherapy. The idea was that patients who responded well could be treated with chemotherapy and radiation, whereas patients who did not respond well would have surgery to remove the voice box immediately, rather than trying chemotherapy and radiation first. The goal was to improve the five-year survival rate of patients. The researchers reported that this technique — called “induction chemotherapy” — was effective, leading to 79 percent survival rates for patients with advanced laryngeal cancer — which is markedly better than the 66 percent survival rate for those patients who did not receive induction chemotherapy. The release does a nice job describing the historical context of these therapies, how available the techniques are and how the study was conducted, with one exception. The release doesn’t mention that this was a retrospective, observational study, not a clinical trial, which is an important limitation. Correlation does not equal causation. Nor does the release provide any costs associated with any approach. People don’t want to lose the power of speech. Whether it’s reading bedtime stories to one’s children or talking about your day with loved ones, speech is an important part of interpersonal communication. Our voices are part of who we are and how we connect with others. What’s more, being able to talk can be a key part of professional life for everyone from teachers and salespeople to reporters and, well, doctors. For that reason, many patients dealing with laryngeal cancer want to do whatever can be done to spare their larynx, or voice box, from surgery. If new techniques can help patients make more informed decisions about the trade-off between survival rate and laryngeal surgery, that’s important news for patients and medical personnel. The release does a fair job of addressing the new findings responsibly. It stresses that there are many options and no one-size-fits-all treatment.","Matt Shipman,Doug Campos-Outcalt, MD, MPA,Kathlyn Stone","This is the one area the release fails to address at all. Cost is simply not addressed. The release explains the benefits for patients with stage 3 and stage 4 laryngeal cancer: “Average disease specific survival at five years for the induction chemotherapy patients was 79 percent – equivalent to the results in patients with early stage disease, and significantly better than the 66 percent survival for patients who had chemo-radiation without the induction strategy.” However, there were some shortcomings here. According to the study, surgery achieved the best survival results. It may not be possible to conclude anything about the “chemo trial” group because the study was observational – taking a retrospective look at 10 years of patient charts – which does not prove cause and effect. In each of the 153 cases, patients and doctors chose which treatment type they preferred; 71 were given a test dose of chemotherapy and then had further treatment decided based on the response. The release doesn’t tell us how many were then treated with surgery due to lack of response and how many completed chemotherapy/radiation treatment. The release states: “Even that single [initial] dose of chemotherapy can be debilitating and toxic for some patients.” That’s enough to earn it a marginal satisfactory mark here. The release would have been better if it had noted that radiation, surgery and chemotherapy all carry serious side effect risks. The release does a good job of explaining the study design. It would have been even better if it had placed the work in the context of what is known from the literature about five-year survival rates for specific types of laryngeal cancer, which vary widely. It would also have been better to spell out the study limitations, the main one being its observational design No disease mongering here. Funding sources are clearly noted in the release and there do not appear to be relevant conflicts of interest. Our main take-away from the release is that there are many treatment alternatives and room for patient and physician joint decision-making. It’s clear that this approach to determining the best course of treatment could be implemented at any point — there are no new technologies or drugs involved. But the release does a particularly good job of addressing this, since it highlights a relevant challenge: “The induction approach can be done anywhere, but requires intense collaboration among surgeons, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists. All three must be involved to assess the patient and refer to the appropriate therapy.” Communication between all of the practitioners involved in the case of any given patient can be a significant challenge, and is well worth mentioning. The release makes clear what is novel about this approach and lays out the history and development of the approach over the past 10 years. That’s good context. We give this a satisfactory rating, but want to make two notes — one on something we particularly like to see, one on something that we don’t. First, kudos to the headline on the news release. It clearly conveys the relevance of the finding without overselling it. The headline doesn’t tell us that the technique picks the best course of treatment; instead, the headline tells us that the new technique helps patients and doctors make a decision about what course of action is best. That’s good to see. Lower down, the story refers to a survival rate as “unheard of.” What does that mean? People say and hear all kinds of things. Are they referring to clinical trial results? Longitudinal study findings? Hearsay? When possible, we discourage the use of this sort of vague language; it offers readers little insight, and does more to confuse a subject than to clarify it. The language in this instance was not sufficiently hyperbolic to warrant a “not satisfactory” rating, but it’s close.",true,laryngeal cancer
705,30273,MAPs (Minor Attracted Persons) created a pride flag,"July 14, 2018","A 1994 study, led by Carole Jenny of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, surveyed 269 cases of children who were sexually molested by adults. In 82 percent of cases, the alleged offender was a heterosexual partner of a close relative of the child, the researchers reported in the journal Pediatrics. In only two out of 269 cases, the offender was identified as being gay or lesbian.",Dan Evon,"A number of fear-mongering campaigns over the years have attempted to link pedophilia to the LGBTQ community, despite an utter lack of scientific proof of any such connection. In December 2017, for instance, internet trolls spread a false rumor that the letter “P,” representing “pedosexual,” was being added to the initialism LGBT (for “lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender”). An eerily similar rumor was spread via social media in June 2018 in the form of an image purportedly showing a “MAPs (Minor-Attracted Persons) Pride Flag” supposedly created for Gay Pride Month:  This picture does not represent a “MAPs Pride Flag.” Rather, the image was created as part of a troll experiment on Tumblr. When pictures of this “MAP flag” began circulating on Facebook, the posts typically included messages warning other social media users to be wary of anyone displaying this flag: This is a Minor Attracted Person (MAP) (polished term for pedophile) flag. If you happen to see this flag on any Social Media Profile or someone using the term MAP in their bio, please REPORT the Pedophile running that account. Do your bit. Websites such as the Daily Caller and “Attitude” picked up on this alleged “MAPs Pride Flag” and reported that pedophiles were “rebranding” themselves as “Minor Attracted Persons” in an attempt to be accepted by the LGBT community: Paedophiles are trying to gain acceptance to the LGBT community by rebranding themselves. In a bid to gain acceptance, they have rebranded themselves as MAPs or “Minor Attracted Persons” and have gone so far to even create a rainbow “Pride” flag for Gay Pride, but Twitter user, Communist Fish, posted a picture back in June to warn children to stay away. The group attempt to claim that paedophiles are misunderstood people and if they do not act upon their attraction to children, they shouldn’t be marginalised. Sites like The Prevention Project have started to post testimonials from paedophiles who are seeking help with their attraction, claiming everyone “needs support”. Pedophiles did not coin the term “minor attracted persons” (or MAPS) to rebrand themselves in 2018 in order to gain entry to the LGBT community. Organizations such as B4UAct have been using the term “minor attracted persons” for years to refer to “adults who experience feelings of preferential sexual attraction to children or adolescents under the age of consent.” The Prevention Project, an organization that helps minor-attracted persons find professional treatment, explicitly denied that the term “MAPs” was an attempt to “rebrand” pedophiles. Rather, they explained that this term was preferred as a broader reference that could accurately encompass hebephiles, pedophiles, and ephebephiles: The term minor is defined as anyone under the age of 18. Therefore, someone attracted to a 14 year old is actually called an ephebephile not a pedophile. Someone attracted to a 13 year old is called a hebephile. Pedophiles are attracted to 6-12 year old children; not teens. Hence why we accurately use the term “Minor Attracted Person” when we discuss providing treatment to men and women with attractions to various ages of minors. We are not trying to “soften the term” or “rebrand” pedophilia to fit in with certain groups. We treat individuals who are attracted to various ages of minors, thus it is accurate to use the term “minor attracted person.” We also found no evidence that this flag originated in earnest as a MAPs Pride Flag. We reached out to the “Prevention Project, who told us they had never heard of this pride flag: “We’re experts in treating MAPs who have zero desire to harm anyone but want support to deal with the stigma of being a pedophile, hebophile or ephebephile. MAPs encompass these 3 terms. None of the MAPs we know (we know a lot) have talked about this [flag].” This alleged “MAPs Pride Flag” appears to have originated on the Tumblr page “Don’t Mistake Our Geography” on 13 June 2018, where it was posted with a brief explanation about what the colors in the flag supposedly symbolized to NOMAPS (Non-Offending Minor Attracted Persons) and an acknowledgement that the “pride flag” had just been created out of whole cloth: The NOMAP community doesn’t really have a pride flag, so in honor of pride month I designed a NOMAP pride flag. The top two stripes are blue to represent NOMAPs attracted to young boys. The bottom two stripes are pink to represent NOMAPs attracted to young girls. The inner stripes are yellow to represent childhood and general attraction to minors, regardless of their gender. The middle stripe is white to represent our innocence and unwillingness to offend. Please feel free to use this flag and make icons out of it etc! Hope you enjoy At the time this Pride flag image was originally posted, the Tumblr page operated under a banner in support of MAPs and included a tagline claiming that the author was “possibly a MAP” and “definitely a supporter.” However, the title of this page was later changed to “Y’all need a therapist, not a community,” and the tagline was altered to read “Not an anti, not an ally, just a training psychologist with some fucking sense.” Here’s a look at how the page was changed. The top image shows the Tumblr page as it was in mid-June, while it was claiming to be a MAP ally; the bottom image shows the page at the time of this writing, after it was revealed that the flag was bogus:  Although we don’t know the motivations of this Tumblr user, it should be noted that the person claimed to be a CSA (child sexual assault) victim. Pedophiles are not rebranding themselves as MAPs to gain entry to the LGBT community, nor did they release an official “MAPs Pride Flag.” As we noted in our article about the homophobic and false rumor that a “P” for pedosexual was being added to the initialism LGBT, no link has been established between pedophilia and homosexuality: An especially pernicious myth is that most adults who sexually abuse children are gay. A number of researchers have looked at this question to determine if homosexuals are more likely to be pedophiles than heterosexuals, and the data indicate that’s not the case. For example, in a 1989 study led by Kurt Freund of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Canada, scientists showed pictures of children to adult gay and straight males, and measured sexual arousal. Homosexual men reacted no more strongly to pictures of male children than heterosexual men reacted to pictures of female children.",false,"Politics, homosexuality, lgbt, maps"
706,32600,The Department of Homeland Security is secretly moving and releasing crowds of undocumented people into the United States.,"June 20, 2016","It’s possible, even probable, that the unnamed sources in this Judicial Watch saw families being bused from one detention center to the next or sent to transportation hubs in order to join family members in the United States pending further immigration hearings. This has been standard policy and practice for years in the U.S. However, it’s also possible — and maybe probable — that given there are no names, dates, or facts given in the article, that none of this happened as described at all, and that the article is little more than empty conjecture.",Brooke Binkowski,"The international border that separates the United States in Mexico seems to grow exponentially in the public’s interest the closer the U.S. presidential elections loom. While it is often difficult to find actual information, misinformation about the region abounds  — often calculated to shock, enrage, or annoy would-be voters, such as an article that showed up on JudicialWatch.org on 3 June 2016: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is quietly transporting illegal immigrants from the Mexican border to Phoenix and releasing them without proper processing or issuing court appearance documents, Border Patrol sources tell Judicial Watch. The government classifies them as Other Than Mexican (OTM) and this week around 35 were transferred 116 miles north from Tucson to a Phoenix bus station where they went their separate way. Judicial Watch was present when one of the white vans carrying a group of OTMs arrived at the Phoenix Greyhound station on Buckeye Road. The OTMs are from Honduras, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala and Border Patrol officials say this week’s batch was in custody for a couple of days and ordered to call family members in the U.S. so they could purchase a bus ticket for their upcoming trip from Phoenix. Authorities didn’t bother checking the identity of the U.S. relatives or if they’re in the country legally, according to a Border Patrol official directly involved in the matter. American taxpayers pick up the fare for those who claim to have a “credible fear,” Border Patrol sources told JW. None of the OTMs were issued official court appearance documents, but were told to “promise” they’d show up for a hearing when notified, said federal agents with firsthand knowledge of the operation. The article was quickly picked up by other sites despite its lack of vetted information or named sources. It claimed that thanks to a lack of room in detention facilities, busloads of people in the U.S. illegally were getting put into buses and driven away to be released elsewhere in the country — and all on the taxpayer’s dime: Outraged Border Patrol agents and supervisors on the front lines say illegal immigrants are being released in droves because there’s no room to keep them in detention. “They’re telling us to put them on a bus and let them go,” said one law enforcement official in Arizona. “Just move those bodies across the country.” Officially, DHS denies this is occurring and in fact earlier this year U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske blasted Border Patrol union officials for denouncing this dangerous catch-and-release policy. The Department of Homeland Security is denying this because it isn’t happening  — at least, not as described. The article quoted above is conflating “illegal immigrants” with refugees and asylum seekers, who often show up on the southern border of the United States because that is the most accessible route from South and Central America, particularly from “Northern Triangle” countries (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador) that are plagued by violence and political and economic instability. Refugees and asylum seekers are subject to entirely different definitions and laws under the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and are considered a protected class: (42) The term “refugee” means: (A) any person who is outside any country of such person’s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, or (B) in such circumstances as the President after appropriate consultation (as defined in section 207(e) of this Act) may specify, any person who is within the country of such person’s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, within the country in which such person is habitually residing, and who is persecuted or who has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The term “refugee” does not include any person who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. For purposes of determinations under this Act, a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion. Many people show up asking entry into the U.S. on humanitarian visas, particularly women and children, the two most vulnerable groups in any unstable situation. In 2014, the number of families applying for asylum or refugee status through the United States’ southern border reached historic numbers, overwhelming shelters and detention centers while their applications were processed and creating uproars from one end of the country to the other. It’s possible to apply for asylum in the United States two ways: through the affirmative asylum process (if the party applying is already present in the country) or through the defensive asylum process (when you request asylum as a defense against removal from the United States). Refugee status is very similar, but asylum can be requested before entering the U.S. When asylum-seekers appear at a border of the United States, they are transported to a detention center pending their interview with an immigration judge to see whether they are fleeing what’s considered a credible threat. If they are denied, they’re deported or can appeal, in which case they remain in immigration detention until their case can be heard again. Increasing numbers of people requesting asylum or refugee status means immigration judges are overwhelmed — and that detention centers equipped to hold families are full to overflowing. (The use of detention centers is controversial and strongly discouraged in international law.) When minors are entering the United States without adult family members, the general policy is to release them to family members within the country pending their immigration hearings, or to keep them in the least restrictive environment possible if they must be detained. When children and families are moved from site to site, they are often processed together and bused from one place to the next. It’s also true that minors from countries other than Mexico and Canada have a different classification than Mexican and Canadian nationals: Children from Mexico and Canada can either choose to leave voluntarily or be sent home within 48 hours under repatriation agreements. Children from all other countries must be transferred to HHS within 72 hours for court review of their immigration claims. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) in HHS reunites the child with family or a friend, or in approximately 10 percent of the cases, places them in foster care. After being placed, every child is put into deportation proceedings. The children may then be granted permission to stay (for example, through family visas, special immigrant juvenile visas or asylum) or be removed from the United States. (Court review is required, under a 2008 trafficking law, for children from countries other than Mexico and Canada.) Sometimes, particularly when the bureaucratic controls over refugee status are overwhelmed, some people do slip through the cracks. However, they’re never released en masse on unsuspecting suburban populations.",false,"Crime, central america, immigration, immigration controversies"
707,23840,Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning.,"June 21, 2010",Snooki says Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning,Robert Farley,"In a video promo for the new season of MTV's Jersey Shore, Snooki gets all, like, political. ""I don't go tanning-tanning anymore because Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning,"" Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi says after her boyfriend is shown spray-tanning her face. ""And I feel like he did that intentionally for us."" ""McCain would have never put a 10 percent tax on tanning,"" she said, adding, ""because he's pale, so he'd probably want to be tan."" McCain entered the discourse via Twitter: ""Snooki, u r right, I would never tax your tanning bed! Pres Obama's tax/spend policy is quite The Situation. but I do rec wearing sunscreen!"" We should hope so. McCain has a history of battling skin cancer. But let's get to the facts. Did President Barack Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning? On March 23, 2010, Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka the health care bill) into law. And Chapter 49, SEC. 5000B makes this all very clear: ""There is hereby imposed on any indoor tanning service a tax equal to 10 percent of the amount paid for such service."" We were pretty sure Snooki was kidding about Obama passing that provision specifically to stymie the Jersey Shore crew. But it turns out that the president had mentioned her by name on May 2, 2010, and said she'd be exempt: ""This next provision is called the Jersey Shore-Up,"" Obama said. ""It reads: 'The following individuals shall be excluded from the indoor tanning tax within this bill: Snooki, J-WOWW, the Situation, and House Minority Leader John Boehner.'"" (""The Situation"" and ""JWOWW"" are other members of the Jersey Shore cast.) Alas, Obama's comment was made during the White House Correspondents Association Dinner. In other words, it was a joke. (Yes, it scares us too that Obama and McCain are so familiar with Jersey Shore.) If we really wanted to pick a fight with Snooki, we could take issue with her saying it was a tax on tanning. There's no fee on sunshine, just indoor tanning. Or that it's Obama's tax. There's no indication an indoor tanning tax was Obama's idea. It was proposed by Senate Democrats in December as an alternative to a proposed tax on cosmetic surgery. The cosmetic surgery lobby (funded by plastic surgeons) apparently held more sway than the indoor tanning lobby. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation projected the tax will raise $2.7 billion over 10 years to help offset the cost of expanding medical coverage. Legislators said they also hoped it might discourage teens from indoor tanning, as some studies suggest it is linked to higher risk of cancer. The bill was passed by Congress, but Obama signed it, so we think Snooki's assigning the tax to Obama is fair. One other small point. The indoor tanning tax goes into effect on July 1, 2010. So when Snooki made her comment, she still could've gotten her tan on sans Uncle Sam's extra reach. But we're assuming Snooki isn't so much worried about the money as the principle. We rate her comment friggin' .",true,"National, Health Care, Snooki, "

Eisen, now chair of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, referred to a set of federal regulations that lay out the ethical conduct of executive branch employees. (As Eisen noted, Trump, as president, is exempt.) These rules are overseen by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, or OGE, an executive branch agency whose 4,500 ethics officials serve as watchdogs over the executive branch to prevent (or resolve) conflicts of interest, with the aim of safeguarding governmental integrity. Eisen specifically pointed to a section of the rules that deal with executive branch employees misusing their government jobs. The section states that an executive branch employee ""shall not use his public office for the endorsement of any product or enterprise."" Because of that rule, the ethics office also has long considered it improper for an executive branch employee to condemn a company, said Walter Shaub, who led the OGE until his resignation in July 2017. ""You can't use your government position to endorse a company, and you can't trash a company to the advantage of a different company,"" said Shaub, who is now the senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center. It's unclear if Trump’s event is being held by the White House or the Trump/Pence campaign, and neither organization replied to our questions. (Eisen's tweet — and this analysis — deals with official government events. A separate set of laws, including the Hatch Act, would apply if White House staffers participated in a campaign event, sources said.) Absolutely, according to Shaub, who retweeted Eisen’s warning to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. ""Hey @PressSec & @RajShah45, Norm is right. If you or ANY WH staffers work on this or post it on the WH website, it will be a violation of the Standards of Conduct.

""It’s not even a close call,"" he said. ""Sending out tweets talking about how great Fox News is, which is a business, and now he’s going to give awards trashing CNN and others, which are businesses, is preferential treatment."" Richard Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said that while some ethics rules can be ambiguous, a Trump staffer's participation would be out of bounds. ""The endorsement of some news outlets and the condemnation of others crosses the line under the OGE regulations,"" he said. ""It’s hard to show where that line precisely is, but what I can tell you is it has been crossed in this instance."" Absent some kind of serious government study showing systemic failures by certain media organizations, there’s no compelling government interest that justifies the staging of fake news awards, he said. Painter said Trump’s tweets, as well as other administration actions affecting the media industry, raise First Amendment concerns. This makes it more likely an ethics official would find a staffer broke the rules by participating in Trump's fake news awards, he said. During his time in office, scores of Trump’s tweets have followed a familiar pattern: praise for Fox News and scorn for its competitors. On Twitter, Trump mentioned Fox News, its programs or its hosts in more than 70 tweets that describe the right-wing media outlet in positive, if not glowing, terms. Trump uses Twitter to promote Fox News reporting, highlight favorable coverage of him and his administration and lavish praise on the network while condemning their competitors. ""The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!"" Trump tweeted Feb. 15, 2017. The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great! Over the same period, Trump has mentioned Fox News' rivals more than 50 times. Aside from two tweets promoting his own interview on ABC News, these tweets have ranged from negative to scathing. ""The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!"" Trump tweeted Feb. 17, 2017. In addition to Trump's tweets, Painter said there’s other evidence the administration has used its power to play favorites in the media industry, raising First Amendment concerns that bolster the case that the fake news awards are out of bounds. He pointed to the Justice Department's antitrust suit against Time Warner, which has raised questions about whether this was done as retribution against CNN; Trump’s threat against NBC's license over reporting he disputed; and Trump’s repeated — and false — attacks on Amazon and its chairman Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post. Painter also noted Trump congratulated Rupert Murdoch, who co-chairs 21st Century Fox, over a deal to sell significant Fox assets to Disney, after Trump reportedly sought reassurance that Fox News wouldn’t change hands. ""There's some concrete evidence that they're playing favorites with the media organizations in official action, and penalizing those who do not give them the news coverage they like,"" Painter said. ""Couple that with the president's tweets, including several that suggest he wishes he were in a country without the First Amendment, and this is viewed as a part of a pattern of conduct."" Both Painter and Shaub noted the ethics rules also require loyalty to the rule of law and the constitution. ""In effect the president is trying to establish official news media, establish that Fox is good and CNN is bad,"" Painter said. ""That does loop back into what's a reasonable application of the OGE rule if what you're doing is treading really close to a First Amendment problem."" Eisen and Painter are chair and vice chair, respectively, of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which unsuccessfully sued Trump for violating a constitutional bar on presidents and federal officials accepting gifts and payments from foreign governments. Eisen said the White House staff risks violating federal ethics rules if they participate in Donald Trump’s ""fake news awards."" Two experts, who practiced government ethics at the highest levels, said participation by White House staffers would violate federal ethics rules. Trump, for the record, is exempt.

The drugs showed “clearly better” results, according to U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in a trial of four potential treatments being conducted during the second-largest Ebola outbreak in history, now entering its second year in DRC. The drugs improved survival rates from the disease more than two other treatments being tested - ZMapp, made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical, and Remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) - and those products will be now dropped, said Anthony Fauci, one of the researchers co-leading the trial. The agency said 49% of the patients on ZMapp and 53% on Remdesivir died in the study. In comparison, 29% of the patients on REGN-EB3 and 34% on mAb114 died. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director general of Congo’s Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale in DRC, who co-led the trial, said the results meant that “from now on, we will no longer say that Ebola is incurable.”  “These advances will help save thousands of lives,” he told reporters. Anthony Fauci, NIAID’s director, also said the results were “very good news” for the fight against Ebola. The agency said that of the patients who were brought into treatment centers with low levels of virus detected in their blood, 94% who got REGN-EB3 and 89% on mAb114 survived. In comparison, two-thirds of the patients who got Remdesivir and nearly three-quarters on ZMapp survived. Ebola has been spreading in eastern Congo since August 2018 in an outbreak that has now killed at least 1,800 people. Efforts to control it have been hampered by militia violence and some local resistance to outside help. A vast Ebola outbreak in West Africa from 2013 to 2016 became the world’s largest ever when it spread through Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and killed more than 11,300 people. The Congo treatment trial, which began in November last year, is being carried out by an international research group coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s emergencies program, said the trial’s positive findings were encouraging but would not be enough on their own to bring the epidemic to an end. “The news today is fantastic. It gives us a new tool in our toolbox against Ebola, but it will not in itself stop Ebola,” he told reporters. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, also hailed the success of the trial’s findings, saying they would “undoubtedly save lives”. “The more we learn about these two treatments ... the closer we can get to turning Ebola from a terrifying disease to one that is preventable and treatable,” he said in a statement. “We won’t ever get rid of Ebola but we should be able to stop these outbreaks from turning into major national and regional epidemics.”  Some 681 patients at four separate treatment centers in Congo have already been enrolled in the Congo treatment clinical trial, Fauci said. The study aims to enroll a total of 725. The decision to drop two of the trial drugs was based on data from almost 500 patients, he said, which showed that those who got REGN-EB3 or mAb114 “had a greater chance of survival compared to those participants in the other two arms”. The two promising drugs are made from Ebola antibodies - a protein produced by the immune system to defend against infection. Regeneron’s product is a cocktail of three Ebola antibodies, while mAb114 is a single antibody developed by scientists at NIAID.",true,Health News

You can read our story here. On 23 June 2018, an article appeared on a site called The Weekly Observer (no connection to the Hemingway, South Carolina newspaper of the same name) saying that Joe Jackson, the father of Janet, Jermaine, and the late Michael Jackson, had succumbed to cancer at the age of 89: Joe Jackson, the father of the famous family Jackson, lost the fight against cancer as he suffered from incurable illness and was in the final stage, many American media reported. The TMZ.com website, citing family sources, reported that 89-year-old Jackson suffered from cancer at the final stage. The Variety magazine supports a source that knows its status confirmed this information while DailyMail.com, based on family members and other unspecified sources, wrote that Joe Jackson suffered from cancer in the pancreas. Zerman Jackson, one of Joe Jackson‘s sons, confirmed on Twitter that his father died. Despite inspiring a rash of erroneous death notices and remembrances on Twitter and Facebook, however, the claim that Jackson had passed away was a fabrication. As of 25 June 2018, no legitimate media sources had reported that Jackson was dead. TMZ.com did report on 22 June that Jackson was hospitalized with untreatable “terminal cancer.” An article on DailyMail.com offered more details about the illness, saying Jackson is suffering from stage four pancreatic cancer. It quoted Jermaine Jackson, 63, as saying his father was “very, very frail” and didn’t have long to live (Jermaine later tweeted that he had confirmed details about Joe Jackson’s condition to the reporter.) False rumors of Jackson’s death had circulated before in May 2016 after he was hospitalized with a high fever. In that case he responded with a notice on his web site saying “I Am 100% Alive,” and that the rumors were “greatly exaggerated.” He has not yet posted a reaction to the more recent false reports.",false,"Junk News, celebrity death hoaxes, fake news, joe jackson"
715,12694,It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care.,"March 31, 2017","Yoho said ""It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care."" Yoho’s spokesman said that he didn’t mean to use the word ""worst."" His evidence focused on studies about Medicaid outcomes within the United States with no comparison to other countries. Yoho intended to argue that Medicaid under the ACA hasn’t improved health outcomes. Kaiser examined multiple studies and found Medicaid expansion improves access to care and self-reported health, but additional research is needed to determine effects on health outcomes. As far as Yoho’s original statement. ",Amy Sherman,"U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, is a frequent critic of the Affordable Care Act but opposed his party’s health care plan. The ACA passed under President Barack Obama included the expansion of Medicaid, a program that provides health coverage for about 74 million poor Americans. (Yoho’s state of Florida rejected the expansion.) Yoho, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, says the law has driven people to Medicaid, a program he described as a worldwide failure. ""With the Affordable Care Act, what’s happened is, all these people have been running to Medicaid, and it’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care,"" he said in a March 14 interview on PBS, about a week and a half before the Republicans canceled a vote on their health care plan. Yoho spokesman Brian Kaveney walked back the congressman’s statement somewhat when we asked for evidence that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world. ""Hindsight being 20/20, the congressman didn’t mean to use the word ‘worst,’ "" Kaveney said. ""The congressman was pointing out that since the implementation of ACA, health care trends have not improved."" Kaveney added: ""To say that Medicaid expansion under ACA has resulted in better health outcomes would be a very debatable point."" Experts we interviewed about Medicaid outcomes said they were unaware of any research comparing Medicaid outcomes with the rest of the industrialized world. Leighton Ku, an expert on health policy at George Washington University, said that Medicaid improves access to care for poor people, but research about outcomes comes with caveats. ""There is no question -- and there is a lot of research -- that Medicaid improves poor people's access to health care, in terms of seeing a doctor, getting medications, etc.,"" he told PolitiFact. ""The problem with comparing health outcomes is that Medicaid recipients start out sicker, both because they are poor, but also because people who are sick really need to get Medicaid to get access to care, while healthier poor people may go uninsured because they don't need much care."" Studies about Medicaid Yoho was referring to two articles in 2017 by Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute and a policy director for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Cass argued that Medicaid studies show that the program doesn’t improve public health. But there aren't studies comparing its health outcomes to other industrialized countries. ""Whether people on Medicaid have better or worse outcomes than people in other countries doesn’t tell you anything about the effectiveness of Medicaid,"" Cass told PolitiFact. ""The question is whether there are public programs that have as little effect on outcomes relative to the baseline of no-insurance in that country."" Let’s look at the studies that Cass cited, some of which we have reviewed before. Oregon study: Cass wrote that a 2013 study about Medicaid expansion in Oregon showed ""recipients gained no statistically significant improvement in physical health after two years."" The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment compared about 6,000 patients who got a slot in a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn’t. Over two years, the study found that while patients in the program initially reported feeling better, there was no real change in health indicators such as diabetes control, cholesterol or blood pressure. However, patients in the study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health. Harvard study: Harvard researchers compared the effects of Medicaid expansion programs in Arizona, Maine and New York with other states that made no change in the 2000s. ""Only one of the three achieved a statistically significant reduction in mortality,"" Cass wrote. One of the study’s authors, Ben Sommers, said when examining each state individually only the largest state -- New York -- was significant on its own. Sommers has since done additional research and found that deaths from causes most treatable with timely medical care — such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes — did go down in the other two states expanding Medicaid as well. (Sommers did part-time work for the Obama administration.) Study on life expectancy and income: Cass also cited a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that examined the relationship between life expectancy and income. The study was not about Medicaid, but found differences in life expectancy for low-income individuals is not significantly correlated with measures of the quantity and quality of medical care. ""Our study shows that behavioral conditions such as smoking and obesity are very important in mortality,"" study author Raj Chetty told PolitiFact. ""The study does not imply that Medicaid is not important, let alone that it has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world."" Cass cited one positive health impact from Medicaid: He wrote that it ""may have significant positive effects on pregnant women and young children."" Researchers at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation looked at the big picture for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Kaiser reviewed 108 studies about the expansion of Medicaid under the law. They found that most research shows that the expansion positively impacts access to care and improved self-reported health. More research was needed, however, to know the effects on health outcomes. Harold Pollack, a University of Chicago professor of social services administration, said that Medicaid, much like private insurance, is a weaker tool in improving health outcomes than  experts would like to see. But Medicaid critics sometimes omit context about the program for the poor. ""Many studies that compare Medicaid recipients to others find negative associations between Medicaid and health for the simple reason that Medicaid serves individuals facing the greatest social and health risks,"" he said. ""These cannot be interpreted as identifying a harmful causal role of Medicaid."" Our ruling Yoho said ""It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care."" Yoho’s spokesman said that he didn’t mean to use the word ""worst."" His evidence focused on studies about Medicaid outcomes within the United States with no comparison to other countries.

Yes, you can find individual cases to back up each of Grace's points, but Grace suggested pot drives people generally to commit violent acts, and there's no evidence of that. Behavioral science experts we consulted stressed using marijuana has consequences. But a hard turn toward violence, including shooting each other and killing families, isn’t one of the direct effects from using the drug for most people.",Katie Sanders,"An amusing Web video pits tough-talking former prosecutor and HLN host Nancy Grace against a combative adversary on the subject of pot: Nancy Grace. In one frame, Grace argues smoking marijuana makes users less prone to picking a fight or ""basically starting Mortal Kombat."" They’re more likely ""to lay on the sofa and eat,"" she said while discussing Trayvon Martin having marijuana in his system at the time of death. In the other frame, Grace is heated up about the debate du jour: legalized recreational pot in Colorado. In a recent show, Grace dismissed the arguments of a marijuana advocate who thinks the drug should be legalized and regulated like alcohol. She argued about whether the drug is ""highly addictive"" with Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Mason Tvert, who suggested Grace is against legalization because ""she does not like the people that use marijuana."" She disagreed. ""The reason I’m against legalization of pot is that I’ve seen too many felonies, and I don’t mean pot sales or growing pot,"" she said. ""I mean people on pot that shoot each other, that stab each other, strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families — wipe out a whole family."" Tvert went on to chastise her ""1930s"" tone, and the argument went on. For many, Grace’s comments about people using marijuana and committing violent acts raised eyebrows, so we decided to check it out. HLN publicists did not respond for comment. The consensus among drug and psychiatry experts: Marijuana alone does not propel one to commit acts of violence. Most users are not lighting up and heading over to Fight Club. They want to wind down, not amp up. And while there is evidence that people who commit crimes often smoke marijuana (in part because smoking marijuana is a crime in many places itself), there is little support to back up the idea that it drives people to commit crimes, especially violent ones like Grace described. ""Clearly the majority of users don’t become aggressive,"" said Dr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and chief of the Division of Substance & Alcohol Abuse at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. ""Definitely in terms of clinical work, violence is not the first thing that comes to mind when people are dealing with marijuana."" That said, marijuana is still a mind-altering drug, and it could have a different effect on people who are predisposed to aggression and anxiety, he said. It could induce fear or paranoia when people cannot process an environment, though some may withdraw instead of reacting aggressively. Other psychologists and psychiatrists essentially agreed with Salloun. ""Other than people driving under the influence, there’s no scientific basis for what she’s saying,"" said Matthew Johnson, associate professor in the psychiatry department at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The effect is often not as dramatic as driving under the influence of alcohol, Johnson said. Usually people who drive while high drive slower, and the impairment is usually noticed when the driver’s attention is divided, he said, akin to the effect of some prescription medications. People who come to treatment facilities are typically using multiple drugs, making it tough to suss out which substance was responsible for a violent act. Violence is not typically associated with the use of marijuana, unless the victim is a ""chocolate chip cookie,"" joked Dr. Scott Teitelbaum, professor and vice chairman of the University of Florida’s Department of Psychiatry and chief of the Division of Addiction Medicine. Levity aside, Teitelbaum stressed some people can still become addicted to the drug, and he worries about more young people using it with further legalization. A spokeswoman for the St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Drug Free America Foundation directed us to a slew of news clips documenting shootings related to marijuana theft, grow houses and co-ops. The clips also highlighted marijuana use of gunmen from some of the country’s most recent and notorious shooting sprees. ""In many cases of violence, such as with Benjamin Bishop, Jared Loughner, James Holmes and the Pentagon shooter, these gunmen actively were or previously had been marijuana users,"" said Calvina Fay, the foundation’s executive director, in a statement. She pointed to a 2012 study by researchers from Duke University, the University of Oregon, King’s College London and University of Otago in New Zealand that highlighted brain development in teens who smoke marijuana. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, relied on data for more than 1,000 people who were tracked from the time they were born to age 38. People who started using marijuana as teens and used it at least once a week showed the biggest loss in IQ points. People who picked up the drug as adults didn’t show the same loss in mental functioning. Johnson, the Johns Hopkins professor, says this research is controversial because it’s tough to eliminate marijuana use from all other factors that make people willing to engage in behavior that isn’t socially acceptable. ""But even if that were true, we’re talking about a small minority,"" he said. ""It’s not a question for the large majority of the public."" Gil Kerlikowske, the White House director of national drug-control policy, released an analysis in May that attempted to show a link between crime and marijuana use. It found that 80 percent of adult males arrested for crimes in Sacramento, Calif., in 2012 tested positive for at least one illegal drug. The most commonly detected drug was marijuana, which was found in 54 percent of those arrested. The analysis didn't say what percentage of the crimes were violent and did not conclude that marijuana was the reason people committed crimes. (A positive urine sample only indicates use in the past month.) FBI data for violent crimes with reported drug and alcohol involvement is not broken down by substance, so there is no telling which violent crimes as reported by law enforcement agencies are at least linked to marijuana use. A 2003 report by the National Bureau of Economic Research found ""surprisingly few"" studies have tried to nail down a direct link between marijuana use and crime. After reviewing related academic studies and crunching arrest and crime data, the NBER researchers determined people involved with violent crimes are also likely to use marijuana, but ""the marijuana use is not necessarily related to their decision to engage in crime."" Their report highlighted a 20-year-old study by the National Research Council that suggested longterm marijuana use may affect a person's nervous system so he or she becomes more violent. Still, the causal link ""remains in question,"" the NBER report said. The researchers did find a positive association between marijuana use and property-damage crimes, particularly among youth. Finally, on the subject of high-profile murderers who use the drug, Johnson said there is bound to be overlap between people accused of murder and those who use marijuana given how popular it is. But the same could be said for people who have blond hair and commit murders, he said. One is not a direct result of the other. Dr. Antoine Douaihy of the University of Pittsburgh College of Medicine said even though he thinks Grace is overreaching, there are concerns about the unknown social risks of legalizing marijuana in more states. Often, he said, people are passionate about the topic without noting nuances or differentiating among legalization, decriminalization and authorizing cannabis for medicinal purposes. Our ruling Grace said, people on pot ""shoot each other ... stab each other ... strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families."" Yes, you can find individual cases to back up each of Grace's points, but Grace suggested pot drives people generally to commit violent acts, and there's no evidence of that. Behavioral science experts we consulted stressed using marijuana has consequences.

COVID-19 is the potentially lethal respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. A health ministry spokesman did not respond to a request for comment, but Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Tuesday that the country as a whole had not run out of protective equipment. He encouraged health workers to point out where there were shortages so the government could move stocks around and said no one would be forced to work if they didn’t feel adequately protected. Many doctors are buying their own protective gear in a desperate bid to ward off infection. Officials in the worst-hit Gauteng province appealed over the weekend for public donations of ventilators and vital masks and gloves. The union wants the ministers of health and labour, among others, to establish rules on treatment in the absence of appropriate protective equipment. “The failure to provide guidelines to mitigate the risk to employees in the circumstances unjustifiably and without valid reason places employees at great risk and violates their right to work in a safe environment,” the affidavit said. The union expressed outrage last week that several of its members had contracted the coronavirus at a hospital in KwaZulu-Natal province. Mkhize said on Tuesday that around 48 staff members at the hospital had now tested positive and that provincial officials were discussing closing down parts of the facility. Unions exert great power in South Africa. NEHAWU’s quarter of a million members are part of a group of unions that are in a  alliance with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) party. “We don’t have an unlimited reserve of doctors and nurses, and we know the case numbers are going to rise,” Angelique Coetzee, chairwoman of the South African Medical Association, which represents some 16,000 doctors, told Reuters. A global scarcity of personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves, for nurses, doctors, porters and other health workers is a big obstacle to attempts to curb death tolls, elsewhere in Africa and on other continents.

Dominy and biologist Ryan Calsbeek, both from Dartmouth, in the journal Science. “What began as a pointed anti-nuclear fable has since evolved into a broader allegory for human folly and our reckless disregard for the natural environment.”  Godzilla earned its reputation as a bellwether of collective anxiety soon after Japanese director Ishiro Honda first depicted the dinosaur-like creature in his 1954 film ‘Gojira’ — a nickname derived from the Japanese words for gorilla and whale. In Honda’s film, a radioactive, 50-metre tall Godzilla lays waste to Tokyo after being  awakened from the deep by underwater nuclear tests. Released barely a decade after atom bombs obliterated Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the film was a tacit reflection of Japan’s shared wartime trauma. In King of the Monsters, directed by Michael Dougherty, an embittered former British army colonel, played by Charles Dance, believes modern civilization is on track to wipe out all life on the planet. The colonel and his paramilitary team go on a mission to release gargantuan mutant ‘Titans’ from their resting places to try to tip the scales back into Earth’s favor. No longer the enemy who once delighted in toppling Japanese skyscrapers, Godzilla is cast as an unlikely eco-warrior battling to defeat the Titan menace — led by the three-headed King Ghidorah — and save humanity from itself. Film critics say the devastating elemental forces unleashed by the Titans in the 35th Godzilla film hold up a mirror to real-world fears of wildfires, super-storms and floods caused by growing man-made instability in Earth’s atmosphere. “Dougherty’s film recalls America’s present-day anxieties over increasingly intense weather patterns tearing across the country from coast to coast,” culture writer Andy Crump observed in a review in The Week. Although post-apocalyptic climate scenarios have been a staple of the ‘cli-fi’ genre for years — notable examples include The Day After Tomorrow and Mad Max: Fury Road — Godzilla has returned against a uniquely febrile backdrop. With hundreds of thousands of teen climate activists marching in cities across the world, and Extinction Rebellion bringing parts of London to a standstill in April, a new awareness of the crisis is seeping into mainstream culture. While nobody pretends that a movie can directly deliver cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, fiction can serve as a vehicle to help communities face up to crises that might otherwise seem too overwhelming to contemplate. “We need to engage with the reality of climate change in order to deal with it,” said Caroline Hickman, a psychotherapist who lectures at the University of Bath in southwest England, and is a member of the Climate Psychology Alliance. “The monster gives us a metaphor, a narrative through which we can do that.”  While the new Godzilla film has been panned in some quarters, Zhiwa Woodbury, author of a book on the psychology of the climate emergency, sees King of the Monsters as Hollywood’s most profound ‘cli-fi’ contribution to date. By including a sequence where Godzilla is once more roused by an undersea nuclear blast, Woodbury says the film is asking audiences to heal the rupture in mankind’s relationship with the natural world that occurred at the dawn of the atomic age. “Godzilla is spot-on in asking us to face our inner demons,” Woodbury wrote on his EcoPsychology NOW! blog. “Only then can we hope to rise like a Phoenix from the ashes of the petrochemical age, and regenerate our world on a path of climate recovery.”",false,"National, Government Regulation, Regulation, Barack Obama, "
731,22014,"House Republicans required the use of Styrofoam cups in House cafeterias that are ""part of Koch Industries.","June 1, 2011",Rep. Moran says GOP requires use of cups in House cafeterias made by Koch Industries,Wes Hester,"At a recent Democrat-sponsored rally to end ""corporate dominance of our Democracy"" at George Mason University, Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, used Styrofoam to make a point. Lecturing on what he sees as the growing influence of corporations, Moran suggested a link between between the billionaire Koch brothers of Kansas -- the influential conservative owners of Koch Industries -- and a recent preference for Styrofoam in House of Representatives cafeterias. ""As soon as the Republicans took over the House of Representatives, they threw out all of the biodegradable utensils we were using in the cafeterias and they required us to buy Styrofoam cups and plates and so on that are manufactured by Dixie, and, in fact, this is part of Koch Industries,"" he said. Moran added: ""The CEO was one of the partners of Koch Industries that is now benefiting from what we have to buy because we’re basically a captive audience in the House of Representatives."" That sounds like a conspiracy theory worthy of an Oliver Stone movie. But a PolitiFact check is the best we can offer. We asked Moran’s press secretary where the congressman came up with his information. She didn’t get back to us. Moran’s initial statement begs two questions: 1) Did GOP leaders require the government to buy Styrofoam products from Dixie; and if so, 2) does Koch Industries benefit from that decision? Now for the answers. When Republicans took control of the House in January, House Administration Committee Chairman Dan Lungren, R-Calif., suspended the chamber’s composting program, part of the ""Green the Capitol"" initiative launched by former House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. The program -- which required use of biodegradable corn-based cups, dishes and utensils in the cafeteria -- was costing $475,000 a year to run and a review revealed that it had increased the House’s overall energy consumption, Lungren said. Democrats were quick to pounce on the decision as environmentally unfriendly, even though the move had been recommended by outgoing Administration Committee Chairman Robert A. Brady of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, in December. The decision did in fact lead to a move to Styrofoam. Beyond that piece of truth, however, Moran’s claim runs into serious problems. First, Republicans didn’t make the decision to go to Styrofoam, much less to a Koch-related company. Instead, Restaurant Associates, a company that manages the cafeterias, was given discretion to do what they wanted. ""We just said, `Look, you don’t have to use compostable -- it’s not working. It’s increasing our energy, it’s not reducing our carbon emissions, and it’s costing a half a million dollars a year,’"" said Salley Wood, spokeswoman for the House Administration Committee. ""Of course, they’re going to go to the most cost-effective"" products, she said. They went with WinCup, which makes Styrofoam products. And while Dixie is a brand under Georgia-Pacific, owned by Koch Industries, WinCup has no affiliation whatsoever with Dixie apart from the fact that its owner, George Wurtz, years ago served as executive vice president at Georgia-Pacific, which was acquired by Koch Industries in 2005, a year before he left. ""Restaurant Associates is not currently using Dixie products,"" said Dan Weiser, a spokesman for the House chief administrative officer. So let’s look back. Moran claims that upon taking the House, Republicans ""required"" a move to Styrofoam products made by Dixie, a brand under the Koch Industries umbrella. Problem is, he’s wrong about everything. The vendor, not House Republicans, decided to move to Styrofoam as a cost consideration after the composting program was discontinued for its ineffectiveness and high costs. And even that decision was based on a recommendation by Democrats. Next, the company the vendor chose, WinCup, is not at all related to Dixie or Koch Industries, and is in fact a competitor. The fact that the man who owns WinCup once worked for a company that was bought by Koch Industries is irrelevant. Moran must have been wearing a tin foil hat on the day he came up with this one. !",false,"Virginia, Jim Moran, "

It’s a unique datapoint as politicians and citizens alike argue over how and when to re-open. And one TV outlet says you’re being lied to about it. On the One America News Network, host Liz Wheeler described it this way in a May 8, 2020, clip labeled online as ""What the (mainstream media) was afraid to tell you"": ""There is no evidence to date that there was a surge of infections due to the April 7, 2020, election in Wisconsin. … But did the mainstream media report on this? No, no,"" she said. ""In fact, the mainstream media pretended there was a deadly surge in COVID cases thanks to Wisconsinites voting."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Wheeler is right about there being no evidence of a surge. We’ve repeatedly debunked claims that there was one. But her generalization about ""mainstream media"" claiming otherwise? That’s ridiculous. Let’s take a closer look at how this topic has been covered by prominent media outlets. For starters, let’s be clear that there was no election ""surge."" As of May 11, 2020, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services identified 71 people who tested positive for COVID-19 after voting or working the polls in the April 7 election, according to spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt. The important caveat here is that it’s impossible to say how many were infected at the polls since some reported other possible exposures. The 71 tally runs from April 9 to 21, when the two-week incubation period for the coronavirus would have ended. There were 1,864 positive tests in that span in Wisconsin, so the cases known to intersect with election activity accounted for less than 4% of that total. Now on to the ""mainstream media"" reports. Wheeler’s report cites no sources for the claim the media said there was a surge in cases, so we cast a wide net looking at news coverage ourselves. CNN — a favorite target for far-right claims of media bias — reported on April 22 about what was then 19 cases in people who voted or worked the polls. The third and fourth paragraphs of the story detail the caveat that those people had other exposures, so it’s impossible to say the election was the source. ABC News published a similar report April 21, prominently noting the same caveat in the second paragraph. The Associated Press, reporting on updated data April 29, said 50 people connected to the election had tested positive. It noted the origin caveat in the second paragraph. Like the CNN and ABC reports the week before, it contained no hyperbolic language calling this a surge or anything close to that. In-state sources were even more clear. An April 22 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story was headlined, ""Two weeks after election, COVID-19 cases have not spiked in Wisconsin but experts urge caution about conclusions."" A Wisconsin State Journal report on April 23 worked the ""can’t say for certain"" caveat into the lead sentence. It did the same for a May 8 story when the tally had grown to 67. And a fact-check published by both PolitiFact Wisconsin and USA TODAY rated False a claim from a little-known news outlet that there had been a ""surge"" in COVID-19 cases in Wisconsin after the election. Here’s what that fact check said about the sloppily-reported claim from SecondNexus.com: ""The data the article cited failed to factor in a drop in the number of tests administered. It wrongly treated an unusually low number of cases on April 13 as a baseline against which to compare the following days’ new cases. The increase cited was in fact connected to an increased number of tests in the following days."" Both the article and the tweet it was based on were removed after that fact-check published. We won’t bother to dive deeper into Wheeler’s ""pretended"" claim. That adds another layer of absurdity since it implies some kind of intentional coverup or falsehood, when there’s no proof the coverage was wrong in the first place. The One America News Network claimed in a video posted to Facebook that ""mainstream media pretended there was a deadly surge in COVID cases thanks to Wisconsinites voting."" We didn’t find a single traditional or ""mainstream"" news outlet that characterized the election-related cases as a surge or anything close to that — much less anything that would support this kind of sweeping generalization. The reports prominently noted the caveat that officials can’t say for certain that the election caused the cases we are aware of, and they had made no exaggerated claims about how large those numbers were. (And, to be clear, the 71 cases certainly don’t constitute a surge.) So Wheeler is flat wrong in both her claim about coverage and the related implication from the use of ""pretended"" that something was reported wrong intentionally. We rate this .",false,"Elections, Fake news, Wisconsin, Coronavirus, One America News, "
734,29390,Television viewers can drastically lower the TV ratings for Donald Trump's inauguration by changing the channel.,"January 10, 2017","As Nielsen’s data is largely drawn from “Nielsen families,” a non-Nielsen family member’s individual viewing (or lack thereof) of Donald Trump’s inauguration would have virtually no impact on the event’s overall television ratings.",Dan Evon,"A “call-to-action” message that urged television viewers to watch anything other than Donald Trump’s inauguration on 20 January 2017 in an attempt to lower the event’s TV ratings (and thus strike a blow to the President-elect’s ego) was widely circulated on Facebook: However, a boycott scheme similar to the described above would likely not be very effective regardless if whether viewers had their televisions turned on, off, or changed to something other than Inauguration Day news coverage. The largest stumbling block to this plan is the assumption that each individual’s personal viewership affects a given television program’s ratings. This simply isn’t the case — unless, of course, that individual is a member of a “Nielsen family.” The Nielsen Company gathers data to determine the ratings of television programs, and while the company employs a variety of methods to collect their data (especially in this relatively new age of Internet streaming), the most common method is via Nielsen families: Chosen at random through proven methodology, Nielsen’s U.S. TV families represent a cross-section of representative homes throughout the country. We measure viewing using our national and local people meters, which capture information about what’s being viewed and when, and in the major U.S. markets, specifically who and how many people are watching. We also have TV set meters in many local markets, and we collect more than two million paper diaries from audiences across the country each year during “sweeps” — specific periods during the months of February, May, July and November. To measure video content viewed on mobile devices, we have expanded our panels to incorporate census-style data from third parties in order to capture the breadth and depth of consumer usage. Nielsen households are randomly selected as a representative sample of the TV-viewing population of the United States: “It’s a very select few,” explains Jon Gibs, Nielsen’s senior vice president for analytics and insights. “The reason these people are picked is because they are representative of a broader population.” The company goes to great lengths to make sure that each household chosen to be among the 25,000 Nielsen households stands for a large number of other people. “We make sure that our TV households maintain what we’d consider sort of normal behavior,” and people are warned against changing their viewing habits just to make a particular show popular. Since Nielsen uses these selected families to determine television ratings, the viewing habits of most people (who are not members of a Nielsen family) go largely unrecorded. Vulture reporter Margaret Lyons addressed this issue in a 2015 Q&A: (Q): Is there an effective way to support my favorite shows? I rarely watch the traditional way anymore, what with DVR, streaming, iTunes, and a public library with a good DVD collection. So when networks are looking at numbers to decide the fate of a show, what do they take into consideration? Tweets? Emails? Purchases? App views? Hulu? Amount of GIFs on Tumblr? Do we now live in a world where Firefly could have been saved? Does my vote “count”? —Annie (A): The short answer is no. And the long answer is nooooooooo, your TV vote doesn’t count in any meaningful way unless you’re a Nielsen family, in which case you affect ratings. And ratings are what count. The various fan ephemera does not have a big or clear impact on keep/cancel decisions. As of August 2016, there were about 40,000 Nielsen households, representing a total of 118.4 million TV-viewing households, in the United States. Steve Krakauer added more detail about how Nielsen ratings were determined in a 2015 post on Autonomous: The households are evenly distributed by population throughout the United States, and are roughly meant to be representative of the population as a whole. They also rotate occasionally. But let’s get back to that number. Maybe 50,000 households seems like a lot to you, but to put it in perspective, there are approximately 100 million households with a TV in the United States. That means even at the high estimate of 50,000 households, the number represents .05% of the households. That would be less than 1/10 of 1%. The ratings that you see — for cable news, for broadcast primetime shows, etc — are then extrapolated out from these Nielsen households. So in this scenario, each household represents 2,000 other households in approximating what the country is watching. Although Nielsen isn’t the only company that compiles TV ratings, they are the company that has the most influence over the purchase of television advertisements: “For 66 years, New York-based Nielsen has calculated viewership numbers. And since Arbitron Inc. got out of the TV ratings business in 1993, Nielsen has been pretty much the only player. Nielsen numbers have been arguably the sole basis on which local and national TV ad rates are calculated, using a ubiquitous cost-per-point formula.” It should also be noted that the way consumers watch television, and the way that Nielsen collects is data, has changed in recent years. For instance, the company inked a deal with DISH Network in April 2016 to incorporate DISH’s set-top boxes into its data. However, this deal was primarily focused on enhancing Nielsen’s data from small, local markets: The Dish info is “the first nationwide dataset to be integrated with our panel data, reaching the perfect balance of deep viewing characteristics and the granularity of large datasets,” says Nielsen’s COO Steve Hasker. “As the global leader in audience measurement, this is another step in our efforts to integrate big data into our portfolio and our Total Audience efforts.” Set top box data is especially helpful in small markets where the sample sizes for Nielsen’s surveys often are too small to give advertisers a clear sense of what niches of viewers watch. So it’s not surprising that Nielsen will begin by blending the Dish data into reports for all 210 markets in its its Local TV Measurement service. The ratings company also will use the results in other products including Nielsen Scarborough, Nielsen Data Fusion, and Nielsen Media Custom Insights.",false,"Entertainment, donald trump, inauguration, tv ratings"
736,17241,Florida ranks first in the nation for access to free prekindergarten.,"March 20, 2014","GlaxoSmithKline said an experimental multiple myeloma treatment has shown a meaningful response in patients that have run out of three previous treatment options, in a boost for the British drugmaker’s cancer drug business.",Amy Sherman,"Two doses of belantamab mafodotin helped subdue the disease in adults who had received three prior treatments for multiple myeloma, a cancer of the white blood cells, GSK said on Friday. The company intends to seek market approval and submit data from the trial to regulatory bodies this year. GSK sold its approved oncology drugs to Novartis in 2014, but has staged a comeback in cancer treatment with a deal to buy U.S. firm Tesaro for $5.1 billion last year and an agreement in February to pay up to 3.7 billion euros ($4.09 billion) to Germany’s Merck KGaA for the rights to a next-generation immunotherapy. “We are on track to file belantamab mafodotin later this year and continue to investigate how it could help even more patients with this disease,” GSK’s Chief Scientific Officer Hal Barron said. The drug targets a protein linked to multiple myeloma known as BCMA. “This is yet another positive signal that GSK’s R&D engine is being turned around and should be well received by the market,” said Liberum analyst Graham Doyle. In another recent win in oncology, GSK’s Zejula - formerly Tesaro’s lead compound - was shown to slow progression of ovarian cancer. GSK shares were up 1% at 0923 GMT versus a 0.4% gain in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index. Details of the belantamab mafodotin trial, which tracked how patients fared over time and did not feature a comparison group without the novel treatment, would be presented at an as yet undisclosed medical conference, the company added. The interim result gives further credence to a class of molecules known as antibody drug conjugates (ADC) that belantamab mafodotin belongs to. The concept further builds on the established method of using antibodies that block or bind to foreign substances in the body. ADC, in turn, are antibodies with a cell toxin as a molecular add-on. That allows chemotherapeutic agents, which are harmful to all human cells, to be brought to cancer cells at much higher doses than in conventional chemotherapy. AstraZeneca agreed in March agreed to pay up to $6.9 billion to work with Daiichi Sankyo on an ADC against breast cancer, in a challenge to another ADC called Kadcyla, made by Roche. Multiple myeloma is the second most common form of blood cancer. While it can be treated, there is no available cure, GSK said. The condition is expected to claim the lives of 13,000 people in the U.S. in 2019, according to the American Cancer Society. The BCMA protein that is characteristic of multiple myeloma is also being used as a target in cell therapies developed by Johnson & Johnson, bluebird bio Inc, Celgene Corp.",true,"Children, Education, Florida, Rick Scott, "
737,35578,"Searching for any three-digit number followed by ""new cases"" on Google provides evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic was manufactured. ","July 23, 2020","Herein lies an even bigger hole in the conspiracy theory. Out of the dozens of social media posts we encountered from people spreading this rumor, we have not seen anyone correctly claim that the search results provided by Google were inaccurate. Our own searches resulted in genuine news articles from national and local media that cited credible sources.",Dan Evon,"In July 2020, a rumor started to circulate online that typing any three-digit number followed by the words “new cases” into Google would return news articles or other reports about COVID-19 in search results. This, according to proponents of this claim, showed that the coronavirus pandemic was nothing more than a conspiracy theory. In all honesty, we had trouble following the logic of this false rumor. Those spreading these “mind blowing” search results also appeared a little unsure of what it meant. Most of the posts we encountered did not lay out any specific claims or accusations. Rather, these messages contained vague statements about how the world was being “played.” As best we can tell, the idea is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (or, possibly, some shadowy group of elites, George Soros, or another frequently invoked boogeyman) were gaming search results in order to inundate the population with coronavirus content and convince everyone that this “hoax” was in fact a real problem. There are, of course, a number of problems with this theory. We have not typed each of the 900 three-digit numbers (100-999) into Google followed by “new cases,” but we did perform a few dozen searches in this manner and in every instance we did get results related to rising COVID-19 cases. For some numbers (typically on the higher range of the three-digit set), Google had to dig back weeks or months in order to find news articles related to the specific search term. Not really. Although some may see (or claim to see) these search results as “mind blowing,” this actually isn’t all that unusual considering the duration (approximately 8 months, as of this writing) and widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consider this: The first case of COVID-19 in the United States was reported in January 2020. Since then, the disease has spread to all 50 states. In the approximately 200 days between the early COVID-19 cases and this writing, state, local, territorial, academic, and commercial entities have reported case numbers to the CDC. Many cities have also held daily press briefings. In addition to multiple entities recording and reporting on these numbers, there have also been national and local news outlets publishing articles on a daily basis about this data. Let’s take a look at the math. If each of the 50 states issued daily reports about COVID-19 cases for 200 days, that would mean 10,000 reports could contain a three-digit number of COVID-19 cases. There are approximately 19,500 municipal governments in the United States. If every one of those governments reported a daily rise in cases over this 200 days, that’s an additional 3,900,000 reports that could contain a three-digit number of COVID-19 cases. If you factor in local and national newspapers and websites (we’ll use 13,000, the number of daily newspapers in circulation in 2014; the actual number is likely much higher due to an unknown number of online news websites), that’s an additional 2,600,000 reports about COVID-19. Even if you reduced the number of possible days from 200 to 120 (lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020), that’s still millions of daily reports that could possibly show a three-digit rise in case numbers. It should also be noted that Google can return search results from international organizations, cities, and news outlets. In other words, there are millions of articles and reports that Google can comb through in order to find a result for each of the 900 possible three-digit numbers.",false,"Politics, COVID-19, Editor's Picks"

The experience of the developed countries shows that nearly all deaths from cervical cancer could be eliminated with widespread screening and vaccination programs. Neither currently exist in Africa, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.",Jon Greenberg,"Vice President Joe Biden has called for a ""moonshot"" to cure cancer. The disease took his son in 2015, and now it has become his mission to eliminate some cancers and turn the rest into treatable, chronic diseases. Biden took his campaign to the Vatican where he said that ""nearly 50 percent of cancers are preventable."" ""Take cervical cancer --  530,000 new cases are diagnosed each year,"" Biden said. ""270,000 people die each year; 87 percent in developing countries. In Africa, it’s the second-most common cancer after breast cancer. It’s a travesty. But it’s fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines."" Biden’s comment about cervical cancer in Africa caught our attention. Is cervical cancer fully preventable with the right interventions? A fact-sheet on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website tells us that Biden is almost but not quite right. ""Every year in the U.S., more than 12,000 women get cervical cancer, and 4,000 die from it. 93 percent of cervical cancer deaths could be prevented through screening and HPV vaccination."" Now, that is for the United States with a system of doctors, clinics and hospitals that far surpasses anything found in any African nation. If it’s not fully preventable here, it’s difficult to see why the results in Africa would be better. Beth Meyerson, a researcher at the School of Public Health at Indiana University is in the middle of a study on cervical cancer strategies in Africa. Meyerson told us ""Sub-Saharan Africa would not be able to achieve 100 percent prevention."" Meghan Dubyak, a Biden spokeswoman, said the vice president was trying to make a slightly different point. ""The vice president was referring to the travesty of cervical cancer being preventable,"" Dubyak said. To be sure, cervical cancer is highly preventable. The journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, says ""cervical cancer is a relatively rare disease in countries that have instituted and maintained national screening programs."" In this light, Biden’s statement draws attention to Africa’s unfortunate distinction. As this World Health Organization map shows, it is a hotspot worldwide for cervical cancer. In every dark blue country, the rate of new cases is over 30.2 per 100,000 women per year. By comparison, the rate in the United States is about 8.1 per 100,000 women per year. Of the 20 nations with the highest incidence of cervical cancer, 16 are in Sub-Saharan Africa. (Some researchers note there are vast gaps in this cancer data and say the true prevalence ""remains largely unknown."") A 2015 report from the Sub-Saharan African Cervical Cancer Working Group, a body of physicians, epidemiologists and cancer researchers, described the key reasons behind the reach of the disease. Screening is sorely lacking. The group found a ""lack of widespread services, delays in receiving results, lack of the high-quality laboratories needed for cytology based screening and absence of adequate centres for the evaluation and treatment of identified patients."" Dealing with cervical cancer exposes the many cracks in the health care systems across the region. Richard Wamai, assistant professor of public health at Northeastern University, said the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa are ill equipped for this challenge. ""Detection will require expanding the health service system, which requires investments in infrastructure,"" Wamai said. ""That calls for prioritization which is difficult to do because of competing health demands. Cancer in general is, to me, the most worrying of all other diseases for the continent. There is very little preparation and in many cases policy makers are not yet awoken to this impending tsunami."" Public health experts also say vaccination programs are essential. Some strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to cervical cancer and some of those strains can be blocked by vaccines. But just as Sub-Saharan countries lack the infrastructure for screening, they also lack a system for vaccinating young women. Speaking at a January 2016 event in Washington, Deborah Birx, U.S. Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy, gave a bleak summary of the status of health care in Sub-Saharan Africa. ""There is no systematic health care for girls between the time they turn 5 and the time they get pregnant,"" Birx said. That age range would be key for any vaccination program. On top of that core challenge, Meyerson said the price tag for vaccines puts them out of reach. ""Many African countries find that the HPV vaccination cost is too high to have broad coverage,"" Meyerson said. Our ruling Biden said cervical cancer in Africa is ""fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines."" The experience of the developed countries shows that nearly all deaths from cervical cancer could be eliminated with widespread screening and vaccination programs. Neither currently exist in Africa, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. We rate the claim .",true,"Global News Service, Health Care, Foreign Policy, Public Health, Joe Biden, "

A  fake news report by the World News Daily Report claimed that   recently-released documents dating back to the early 1900s proved that   the Smithsonian had destroyed tens of thousands of giant human skeletons   in a “major historical cover up.”  The article claimed that the remains   were destroyed because “mainstream archeology can not admit to” their   existence. Despite the website’s  disclosure that its content is intended for “entertainment   purposes,” the story was quickly shared more than 60,000 times on   Facebook. The website publishes satirical articles and accompanying   photos in a way that makes them appear real. But readers who were duped by the story shouldn’t feel bad. A number of  websites and groups have formed around the theory that the   skeletal remains of giants have been found around the U.S. since the   early 1800s. The History Channel has even featured the show, “Search   for the Lost Giants,” on the subject. A speech delivered by Abe Lincoln during a visit to Niagara Falls in   1848 is often used to lend credibility to the giant skeleton theory. Speaking about the unique appeal of the Niagara Falls, Lincoln said:  “But still   	there is more. It calls up the indefinite past. When Columbus first   	sought this continent — when Christ suffered on the cross — when   	Moses led Israel through the Red-Sea — nay, even when Adam first   	came from the hand of his Maker — then as now, Niagara was roaring   	here. The eyes of that species of extinct giants, whose bones fill   	the mounds of America, have gazed on Niagara, as ours do.”  Lincoln appeared to embrace the idea that ancient giants had once walked the  United States. The view wasn’t all that uncommon among influential figures of  the time, either. The book “The  Natural and Aboriginal History of Tennessee,” written by attorney and  historian John Haywood in 1823, attempted to prove that native tribes of  Tennessee were descendants of giant ancient Hebrews. In his book, Haywood writes:  “In White County, a conical mound was lately opened, and in the centre of it was  found a skeleton eight feet in length … With this skeleton was found another  nearly of the same size, with the top of his head flat, and his eyes placed  apparently in the upper part of his forehead. The descendants of these giants, both in the old and new world, agree with each  other in bulk, as their ancestors did with each other, which proves a uniform  cause operating equally both in the old and new world. The decrease in bulk  seems to have kept pace everywhere with the increase of warm temperature, and  with the abbreviation of longevity. The giants of Hebron and Gath, and those of  Laconia and Italy, whose large skeletons to this day attest that there they  formerly dwelt, compared with those now found in West Tennessee, demonstrate  that a change of climate, or of some other cause, has worked a remarkable change  in the human system.”  Haywood was an influential and respected figure, which lends credibility to his  work. At the time of the book’s publication, Haywood  was a justice on the Tennessee Supreme Court, and a county in  Tennessee was named after him the same year it was published. However, Haywood’s  work was later  criticized for inaccuracies. It’s believed that Haywood interviewed  early pioneers and recounted undependable second-hand accounts of their  discoveries in his books. So, while conspiracy theories about the skeletons of giants in the U.S. have  persisted for hundreds of years, nobody has actually found one.

747,11550,Reverse your diabetes -- and you can stay diabetes-free long-term,"March 25, 2016","This release from Newcastle University describes a very small study that sought to control type 2 diabetes in patients through a reduced-calorie diet and a weight-management program. The results showed that 12 of the 30 participants saw a resumption of normal insulin production that continued for six months, supporting the release’s claim of “reversing” the disease. But what about the other 18 patients? A study this small can hardly suggest its finding are applicable to all type 2 diabetes patients which, in effect, it does. And benefits observed after only 6 months may not be maintained over the longer term. The release also omitted discussion of harms and alternatives, and didn’t give us a good picture of how the study was conducted. Rates of Type 2 diabetes have increased markedly in parallel with rates of obesity, especially in developed countries. It has long been recognized that diet, weight loss and exercise can improve the control of diabetes. Large studies investigating the impact of weight loss surgery have demonstrated that blood sugar results can return to normal after significant weight loss. It has also been shown that individuals who regain weight after surgery can then have blood sugars go up again and need to resume medications for diabetes. Patients and their families may excitedly assume that the approach described in this release is right for them and alter their normal regimen in the treatment of their disease. But adhering to the diet discussed in this release will be very difficult for most people and is not without risks. And despite the release’s suggestion of universal benefit, a “reversal” of diabetes did not occur in the majority of patients. Patients should understand that context when weighing whether to embark on such a diet.","Earle Holland,Steven J. Atlas, MD, MPH,Kathlyn Stone","The release makes no mention of cost and while the diet changes, including diet shakes and vegetables, may not exceed the cost of a regular diet, the individualized weight management program for a half-year could represent additional costs for people not in the study, something of which readers should be reminded. The headline on this release, along with the lede, states that diabetes can be reversed while the data provided only suggest that 12 of the 30 participants experienced a return of normal insulin production levels following adoption of a very low calorie diet. Given that this was such a small study, we fault the release for suggesting the results can be extrapolated to the universe of Type 2 diabetes patients. In cases like this, where the number of patients with diabetes is so large, semantics are important. At best, the release suggests that in this small study, only 40 percent of the participants experienced a remission in their disease for a period 6 months — which is not very long considering that most patients who lose weight will eventually regain it over the course of several years. Suggesting that the disease can be “reversed,” without qualifying that the result applies to a limited number of patients, is an exaggeration and far too great a conclusion for this study. There is no mention of any harms that might arise from this approach. There are risks that come with very low calorie dieting — which was done for 8 weeks according to the release. Potential harms of extreme dieting should have been mentioned including whether there were any health issues in the 30 patients over the six months study period. The most common side effect of very low calorie dieting is gallstones, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Minor, short-lasting side effects include fatigue, constipation, nausea and diarrhea. The Institute recommends that patients following a very low calorie diet that results in rapid weight loss should be monitored by a doctor. The study the release is based on is indeed intriguing and certainly supports the idea of a better, larger research effort to test whether its findings are confirmed. But the verbiage used to describe the study’s outcome far exceeds what should be garnered from this research. The release doesn’t paint a full picture of what happened in the study. For example, there is no explanation about the 18 patients in the study whose insulin production did not return to normal, something a thoughtful reader of the release might quickly wonder about. Throughout the release there is mention that the weight loss worked by removing fat from the pancreas, leading to improved release of insulin. One of our reviewers on this release, a clinician and associate professor at Harvard Medical school, thought that this should have been recognized as a hypothesis that is not well supported by a large body of literature. It is not that the pancreas is not producing insulin in Type 2 diabetes, rather it is not producing enough and the insulin being produced is being blocked, especially by the fat cells throughout the body. Losing weight decreases the amount of fat and improves insulin resistance — leading to improved sugars. The hypothesis proposed in this release also is inconsistent with a growing body of genetic studies pointing to the underlying mechanisms that are associated with the development of Type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is currently believed to be associated with a number of different genetic mechanisms, implying that the one mechanism implied in this release, even if true, may apply to only a fraction of patients with Type 2 diabetes. The release doesn’t engage in disease mongering, but neither does it give us much context about Type 2 diabetes incidence. Because the release included a very important caveat about obesity and diabetes prevalence, we’ll give them the benefit of the doubt. “Individuals vary in how much weight they can carry without it seeming to affect their metabolism – don’t forget that 70% of severely obese people do not have diabetes,” according to the release. The release does identify multiple funding sources and there is no suggestion of any conflict of interest. There are alternatives to this diet that have been shown to correct blood sugar results in large studies — specifically weight loss surgery. This should have been mentioned. Given that the approach of this study focuses on specific foods as key to maintaining weight, and that these foods are commonplace, one assumes that they are readily available in the marketplace. The study addresses novelty through this statement: “The research is part of a growing body of evidence showing that people with Type 2 diabetes who successfully lose weight can reverse their condition because fat is removed from their pancreas, returning insulin production to normal.” We think that’s not quite appropriate positioning of the results. While it’s true that there is considerable evidence from studies of weight loss surgery that diabetes values can be normalized with significant weight loss, this release is also suggesting that it has proven that all diabetes patients can reverse the disease through diet alterations, and that the benefits are due to a reduction in fat in the pancreas. These claims go too far based on the small study size and a demonstrated 40 percent success rate. We’re rating this category unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. First, the blatant claim that diabetes can be “reversed” rather than pushed into remission for 6 months based on results from 12 participants who represent less than half of those tested. Second, the lead investigator is first described as “world-renowned” while readers would be hard-pressed to recognize his name. The description of the funders touts its “world-class expertise,” a descriptor which, while it might be correct, offers readers little to help them understand this study.",false,"Academic medical center news release,diabetes,University news release,Weight loss"
748,15348,The murder rate in Atlanta is on the rise this year.,"July 22, 2015","A neighborhood association alerted Atlanta residents that the city’s homicide rate is up for the year and has even reached a 50 percent increase. At one point, the murder rate did spike that high, though with weekly fluctuations, the year-to-date rate is up about a quarter from this time last year. That puts Atlanta in line with other cities seeing an increase in their murder rates. There is little conclusion on what might be driving the rate, or even if different cities share the same causes. But a 24 percent increase is cause for notice.",April Hunt,"Crime is always the sort of news that attracts headlines. Now it’s also generating posts in online forums, where one neighborhood association alerted Atlanta residents that the city’s murder rate was spiking and had even reached a 50 percent increase from a year ago. PolitiFact Georgia couldn’t resist when an alert reader asked us to check it out. After all, the number of murders in several big cities is on the rise nationwide, after years of decline. That includes cities with populations close to those of Atlanta’s roughly 450,000 residents. For instance, through the first half of the year, Milwaukee (population 600,000) has seen a 105 percent surge in its homicide rate and the rate is up by 33 percent or more in Baltimore (about 620,000 residents) and St. Louis (about 320,000) And in Atlanta? According to the Atlanta Police Department website, the rate was up 16 percent in the first half of the year. Through July 11, the most recent date available, there have been 52 murders in the city. During the same time last year, there were 42 murders – a 24 percent increase. So while the increase is not as dramatic as suggested in the neighborhood forum or compared to similar cities, the rate is up. But the rates fluctuate wildly per week, which is how the police department reports all crimes. So it did appear that Atlanta had a serious surge of murders for the week ending May 23, or the 21st week of the year. Then, the homicide rate was up 54 percent at the time (40 murders at that point this year versus 26 last year). Then again, the city went without any murders for three weeks this year, between March 15 and April 2. And that spike in Week 21 was followed by no homicides in Week 22, the data show. In fact, the city had no murders at again for another multi-day run, between June 10 and June 20. ""These numbers are very fluid,"" said Atlanta Police Capt. Michael O’Connor, who serves as the department Homicide Commander. So while brass are concerned that the rate is up and in theory on pace to be above 100 annual murders for the first time in years, ""it’s very difficult to trend to know where you are going to finish the year."" Criminologists support that analysis – and lack of analysis that can be done. To some extent, after years of declining murder rates, an increase can be little more than a statistical blip to get closer to a median. But without minimizing the loss of 52 lives, there isn’t much statistical analysis that can be done with such a relatively low number, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor of criminology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. For instance, only two women have been reported murder victims in Atlanta this year. While that may suggest the city has a better handle on domestic violence murders, a single such death could skew the data to suggest the exact opposite. ""You don’t want to jump to a lot of conclusions,"" Kenney said. ""If homicides are up, you are not necessarily at greater risk because we don’t randomly select our murder victims."" That is, there are some people more at risk to be victims than others. Broadly speaking, that tends to be young men, especially men of color. Atlanta Police have just begun sifting through its first-half data to compare victims, perpetrators and scenarios to see just where the greatest risks lie, O’Connor said. Police do that constantly, targeting for instance a specific neighborhood or specific gang that may be making trouble. Putting a larger number of victims and suspect pool up for comparison should help analysts see if anything stands out that will help insert police sooner into the equation – and hopefully prevent some deaths, O’Connor said. It also will provide Atlanta Police Chief George Turner with some information to share with his counterparts at the Major Cities Chiefs Association on Gun Violence Summit, being held in Washington, D.C. next month. Such events are often heavy on anecdotes, Kenney said, but can provide the start of understanding crime trends. ""When you can see a general increase virtually everywhere, that suggests crime is up but doesn’t tell you anything about why or what to do about it,"" he said. ""Still, the police have to anticipate what they can so they can refocus their energies, and they seem to be doing that.""

749,32,Deadly eruption hits New Zealand volcano tourist town hard.,"December 15, 2019","Helicopter pilot Mark Law did not hesitate to fly out to New Zealand’s White Island volcano immediately after it erupted to carry survivors to hospital, but after a harrowing week he knows his town’s adventure tourism industry faces an uncertain future.",Charlotte Greenfield,"As the search continues for the final two missing bodies from Monday’s deadly eruption, Law knows it will be challenging for his business, Kahu Helicopters. Some of his seven staff, including three pilots, could lose their jobs. “We’re going to be greatly affected, we’re anticipating probably damn near shutting the doors. It’s going to be devastating, we’ve been operating that part of our business for years,” he said. Law is not alone worrying about his future in Whakatane, a picturesque town of 35,000 of the shore of the Bay of Plenty that is the main access point to the volcanic island. Anne Tolley, the local member of parliament, said the town was shattered by the disaster and its thoughts were with the victims, but hoped that tours would one day restart. “It is iconic and it is certainly is the centerpiece of the town’s tourism. We also have fantastic beaches and walks and the kiwi, but Whakaari, you will have seen all the signs, we are the gateway to Whakaari,” Tolley told Reuters, using the Māori name for the volcano. Daily tours had taken more than 10,000 visitors every year to privately owned island 50km (30 miles) off the coast. Tours to the island were part of Whakatane’s history, and operators had been gearing up for the peak Christmas holiday season before Monday’s disaster, Tolley said. “It’s very difficult coming at probably the busiest time of year for them. It will be devastating.”  On Monday, the 48-year-old Law had quickly organized three other pilots to fly out to the island, where they picked up 10 badly burned people and flew them back to Whakatane’s hospital. Law and his team tried to fly back to the island to recover the bodies of those they knew had died, but were “tremendously disappointed” to be stopped by police. After initially being sidelined from police operations, by mid-week Law was sharing his knowledge of the volcano’s terrain and environment with the military squad that on Friday retrieved six of the eight bodies left behind. On the weekend, the search continued for the remaining bodies. “At the end of the day people on the ground generally know and it is important… to weave into the plan the effort of the local people,” Law told Reuters. Shock had ripped through Whakatane at the eruption, with the local hospital overwhelmed as dozens of seriously injured people were delivered from the island. Whakatane’s tourism sector had been growing strongly with the unique marine volcano at its heart, but with the prospect that people may be reluctant to visit the island even if it is reopened, immediate prospects will be challenging. As the recovery mission on Friday played out, Boz Te Moana, 24, and Michael Mika, 28, waited to support their community gathered in the indigenous Māori marae, or meeting ground. The two, who had traveled from their homes further up the Whakatane River, hoped in time tours to the waters around the island would be allowed again but tourists should not step foot on it again, out of respect for the dead, they said. “I don’t know if the mamae or the hurt will ever change, but the environment, it’s up to the town itself to move forward from here in the most positive way,” said Te Moana, using the Māori word for pain.",true,Environment

In fact, just within the past two years, McCain has sponsored and helped enact several major provisions to help veterans. He also devotes a significant portion of his office staff to offer veterans on casework.",Linda Qiu,"Facing a continuing maelstrom over his remark that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is ""not a war hero,"" billionaire businessman and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump wants to shift the focus from McCain’s service record to his track record. McCain may talk a lot about supporting American troops, Trump insisted on ABC’s This Week, but he doesn’t walk the walk. ""I'm very disappointed in John McCain, because the vets are horribly treated in this country. I'm fighting for the vets. I've done a lot for the vets,"" Trump said on July 19. ""He's done nothing to help the vets. And I will tell you, they are living in hell."" He echoed the point that same day in an editorial published in USA Today. Trump wrote: ""Thanks to McCain and his Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, their legislation to cover up the VA scandal, in which 1,000+ veterans died waiting for medical care, made sure no one has been punished, charged, jailed, fined or held responsible. McCain has abandoned our veterans. I will fight for them."" Is Trump correct that that McCain -- a Vietnam prisoner of war and current chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee -- hasn’t helped his fellow veterans? The Trump campaign never got back to us, but McCain’s office did, and, not surprisingly, they begged to differ. They provided a wide variety of examples of things McCain has done for veterans during his nearly three-decade congressional career. Here are a few of the most recent ones: • Military families. In June 2015, McCain co-sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 to cover the travel costs for the family of troops killed in overseas missions. The amendment was adopted by the Senate by unanimous consent. • Veterans health. McCain introduced the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act in early 2015 to increase access to mental health support for veterans. It has become law. • Department of Veterans Affairs. In 2014, McCain -- along with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic presidential candidate -- led efforts to address the scandal over secret waiting lists at VA hospitals by pushing the The Veterans’ Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act all the way to enactment. In 2015, McCain co-sponsored a bill to increase accountability at the department. • Non-legislative support. McCain’s office employs five caseworkers solely dedicated to helping veterans who are running into problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs. A spokeswoman told us McCain’s office has handled more than 2,000 veterans-related cases in 2015 alone. We also reached out to veterans groups. Even those who have taken issue with McCain’s record on veterans disagreed with Trump that McCain has ""done nothing"" for vets. Decorated veteran Brandon Friedman, a former Obama administration official and vice chairman of the progressive VoteVets PAC, detailed McCain’s history of failing veterans in 2008, but rejected Trump’s characterization. "" ‘Nothing’ is a strong word,"" Friedman told us. ""He hasn't been great on veterans issues. That being said … the senator doesn't deserve that."" Groups that gave McCain failing grades during his 2008 White House bid agreed with Friedman. Though McCain voted with Disabled Veterans of America about 20 percent of the time in 2008, the group praised McCain in 2014 ""for putting partisan politics aside to quickly pass bipartisan legislation in response to the current VA health care crisis."" Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America also gave McCain a grade of D in 2010, but pointed to a specific example of McCain’s recent support. ""I have had the honor of working with Sen. McCain on key veterans legislation, including the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act,"" CEO Paul Rieckhoff wrote in the New York Daily News. Other groups also rushed to McCain’s defense. ""Donald Trump also revealed that he has no idea what he is talking about with regards to reforming and fixing the VA. If he did, he would have known that Senator McCain has been a leader in fighting to give veterans more health care choices and to hold the VA accountable for its failures,"" Concerned Veterans for America wrote in statement Navy Vice Adm. Norb Ryan, president of the Military Officers Association of America, said in a press release that McCain has a been a ""champion"" for troops and veterans, arguing that no one has visited American troops more than McCain. ""We can disagree with some of Sen. McCain’s positions at times, but we can never say he has abandoned the troops,"" Ryan wrote on July 20.

755,37739,Deaths unrelated to COVID-19 are routinely being attributed to the virus in order to make it seem worse than it is.,"July 17, 2020",‘State of Illinois Definition of a COVID-19 Death’,  Arturo Garcia  ,"In July 2020, social media users continued spinning a remark by a top health official in Illinois to claim that death tolls attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic have been inflated around the United States — and to attempt to sow doubt around the actual dangers posed by the virus.The idea that public health experts are purportedly inflating the death toll in order to frighten the populace has been a persistent claim from those denying the severity of the global pandemic:Many have latched on to Illinois as an example of how this might be playing out. For example, a YouTube channel posted a clip of remarks made by Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the state Department of Public Health, during an April 19 2020 briefing held by Gov. J.B. Pritzker.Ezike announced at the time that 30,357 cases had been confirmed across the state, with 1,290 deaths. She also fielded a question posed to Pritzker asking whether the death of a sixteen-year-old boy in Cook County attributed to the disease that month was the first instance of the virus killing someone in that age group. Ezike responded:I don’t have that information at my disposal at this time. We have had people of all age groups die. I just want to be clear in terms of the definition of people dying of COVID. The definition is very simplistic. It means, at the time of death it was a COVID-positive diagnosis. That means that if you were in hospice and had already been given a few weeks to live and then you were also were found to have COVID, that would be counted as a COVID death. Technically, even if you died of clear alternate cause but you still had COVID at the time it is still listed as a COVID death. Everyone who’s listed as a COVID death doesn’t mean that that was the cause of the death but they had COVID at the time of their death. I hope that’s helpful.As WAND-TV reported the following month, local officials used Ezike’s statement to fuel their claim that the state death toll of 3,000 people attributed to COVID-19 had been inflated:On May 1, WAND News reached out to Ray Koonce, a member of the Christian County board. He recently sued the Governor over the extended stay-at-home order. When asked if he believes Dr. Ezike, he frankly responded “No I do not.”Representative Darren Bailey also sued the Governor. He told WAND News the governor is not being factual.“You could be driving home and be in an auto accident and die from that,” Bailey said. “And if you had COVID-19 in your system, that death gets labeled as COVID.”As Scientific American reported, accusations that death statistics related to COVID-19 are being “inflated” fail to account for signs that they might actually be undercounted, because states and jurisdictions do not have a uniform reporting for death certificates. In Chicago — the largest city in Illinois — medical examiners are involved in making that determination for every case involving the virus.But Ezike specifically refuted the argument that unrelated deaths are attributed to the virus in an interview with nonprofit news organization Block Club Chicago published in May 2020:“As we learn more about the disease, there may have been less typical presentations of COVID-19 that were not appropriately attributed to COVID because there wasn’t a test done because the suspicion was not there,” Ezike said. “There [are] also some additional deaths [of people] who happened to be COVID-positive but the COVID infection had nothing to do with the death.”For example, a death might be reported to the state and the death certificate might mention coronavirus — but when officials do a further review and see the person died from a shooting or car crash, they exclude that person from the state’s COVID-19 death toll, Ezike said.In a separate interview with WMAQ-TV, Ezike provided more context for her initial remarks, saying that the effects of COVID-19 on a patient made it harder to gauge how much of a factor it could be on their death.“It’s very hard to separate the respiratory illness from some of these other manifestations that could also be linked to COVID, so there is a reason to put them together,” Ezike told the station. “Even if someone had heart disease, global data has established that [COVID-19 can cause] more serious complications, and we’ve seen that for heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.”Jim Allmon, coroner for Sangamon County, corroborated her argument.“If that person passes away from pneumonia because they had obtained this virus, then that virus directly contributed to their death and should be placed as a contributing factor on their death certificate, and that is the only reason why it should be,” Allmon told WICS-TV.At the time of publication on July 17 2020, the state health department’s website listed 7,272 deaths connected to the disease and 159,334 total confirmed cases.Comments",false,"Disinformation, Fact Checks"

This fact directly links Obama to all 150,000 deaths around the world!"" A different post makes a similar point: ""Well well well, in 2015 Obama gave the Chinese lab in Wuhan 3.7M grant to study the corona virus what a coincidence."" The first post builds on the conspiracy theory that the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China created the virus. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There’s nothing correct in this post, although President Donald Trump does play a supporting role in spreading some of the inaccurate information at the heart of the claim. Here’s where the post either misleads or flat out gets things wrong. Early on in the crisis, the idea took hold that the virology lab in Wuhan engineered the virus. We looked at that claim in detail before and found that the genetic sequence of the virus shows no signs of genetic engineering. A research team at Scripps Research compared the virus to viruses that had hit humans, such as the one behind the SARS outbreak, and viruses that are found in animals. All the evidence pointed to a natural source. ""We do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,"" the researchers wrote. There are unresolved concerns that protective lapses at the lab may have allowed a virus collected from nature to escape, and to be clear, that is an unproven allegation, and Chinese officials deny it. But that is different from the virus being intentionally manufactured by human hands. The correct amount sent to the Wuhan virology lab is $598,500, and that was spread over five years, according to the American research group running the project. Here’s what we know about the lab, that work and the U.S. funding. In 2014, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease backed a project by the EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that aims to protect the people, land and animals in areas where viruses can jump from one species to another, as coronaviruses are known to do. The alliance has projects across 30 countries, including many in Asia, such as Thailand, Vietnam and China. The 2014 project focused on bats in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest from Wuhan, on the border with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. In 2018, alliance researchers reported they had found a virus in bats very similar to SARS. ""If we know what viruses are out there in wildlife, and which people are getting infected, we have a chance to stop pandemics dead in their tracks,"" the group’s president Peter Daszak said in a press release at the time. The group contracted the virology lab in Wuhan to conduct the genetic analyses of the viruses that were being collected in the field. The lab was selected after it was approved by the U.S. State Department and NIH. The National Institutes of Health website shows a total award of about $3.4 million over six years to EcoHealth Alliance. The group’s spokesman Robert Kessler told us that, of that, the Wuhan lab received just under $600,000. That’s about 85% less than the Facebook post asserted. That NIH spending included about $265,000 for the lab under the Trump administration. In 2019, NIH renewed the grant to EcoHealth Alliance for another five years. That decision came on Trump’s watch and he said ""we will end that grant very quickly."" There is a virology lab in Wuhan, and it did get money from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. But the post exaggerates what Trump said about that. In an April 17 White House coronavirus briefing, a reporter from the conservative website Newsmax asked Trump about the grant. Here’s the exchange: Reporter: ""(There’s a) report that the NIH, under the Obama administration, in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the U.S. give a grant like that to China?"" Trump: ""The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million? I’ve been hearing about that. And we’ve instructed that if any grants are going to that area — we’re looking at it, literally, about an hour ago, and also early in the morning. We will end that grant very quickly. ""But it was granted quite a while ago. They were granted a substantial amount of money. We’re going to look at it and take a look. But I understand it was a number of years ago, right? ""When did you hear — when did you hear it was — the grant was made?"" Reporter: ""2015."" Trump: ""2015? Who was president then? I wonder."" Trump didn’t announce anything. He responded to the reporter’s question about the grant and said he’d heard about certain reports and was looking into it. A Facebook post said Trump announced that a lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus ""was created"" received $3.8 million under the Obama administration. A reader would see this claim and assume millions of U.S. tax dollars were used to create the virus that leads to COVID-19. That isn’t the case. Trump didn’t make this announcement. He was responding to a reporter’s question. The best evidence so far says the virus was not created in a lab. The money that went to the lab was about 85% less than what the post said.

Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican who is one of the lead co-sponsors of the bill. On Sept. 20, 2017 -- 10 days before a deadline to pass the measure with a simple majority -- there was this exchange between Johnson and Chuck Todd, host of MSNBC’s ""MTP Daily"" talk show: Todd: ""So, you contend that this bill will protect those folks with pre-existing conditions -- period."" Johnson: ""Every bit as well as Obamacare did. And it’s also going to protect the individuals that can’t afford Obamacare right now."" The protections are a major point of contention. The Affordable Care Act makes it illegal for insurers to deny coverage to people who have pre-existing health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes or cancer, or charge them higher rates. But under the Johnson-sponsored plan, waivers that would give states new flexibility erode protections for pre-existing conditions. ""The only way people (with pre-existing conditions) are protected is if every state in the nation looks at this and says, ‘We’re not going to do that,’"" said Karen Pollitz, a health reform and private insurance expert at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. ""This lets states take away your protections.""

That’s for the GOP senators co-sponsoring the measure: Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Dean Heller of Nevada and Johnson. Under Senate rules, the bill could be approved with 51 votes (50 senators plus a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence) if it is adopted by Sept. 30, 2017. After that, Republicans, who hold 52 seats, would need 60 votes, which seems an impossibility. (On Sept. 22, 2017, with eight days left before the deadline, Arizona’s John McCain said he would join two other Senate Republicans who have indicated they would not vote for the bill, potentially dooming its chances.) The bill and pre-existing conditions got heavy attention after late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel, whose infant son was born with a congenital heart disease, attacked it on his show the night before Johnson’s interview. (Johnson has also noted in defending the bill that his adult daughter was born with a pre-existing condition.) How it treats pre-existing conditions The bill keeps the Affordable Care Act prohibition on insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. But states could obtain waivers that would enable them to opt out of other ACA provisions that protect those people. The upshot: States could allow insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions more than they charge healthy people; and the insurers could offer policies that offer less than the ""essential benefits"" that are now mandated. PolitiFact National rated Mostly  a claim by President Donald Trump that the bill includes ""coverage of pre-existing conditions,"" finding that: If a state merely says it ""intends to maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions,"" then it can allow insurance companies to charge sick people more than healthy ones. The federal government could withhold money granted to a state under a waiver if the state doesn’t do as it promised, but the words ""adequate"" and ""affordable"" are open to interpretation. Policies would not have to provide the same level of coverage now mandated under Obamacare. Estimates say about 34 states would see net funding cuts under the bill. It costs money to cover people with known health conditions, and most states would have less of it. Johnson's claim goes further than Trump’s, saying the bill’s pre-existing protections are as good as Obamacare’s. But in reviewing the GOP bill, the political news website Axios arrived at similar findings: The funding cuts ""could pressure states to waive protections for sick people as a way to keep premium increases in check. Older, sicker people in every state could end up paying more as states try to make up for a funding shortfall."" States could get a waiver to let insurers charge sick people more than healthy people. A waiver would exempt insurers from the current requirement to provide ""essential health benefits,"" including prescription drugs -- so, people who need expensive drugs might have to pay out of pocket. And Pollitz told us that states could also allow insurance companies to: Charge lower premiums to people while they’re healthy, but then raise the rates at renewal time if, for example, they get cancer. Charge higher premiums based on a person’s location or occupation, practices that are outlawed under Obamacare. Information from the bill’s sponsors say it would protect people with pre-existing conditions, but doesn’t provide details. Patrick McIlheran, a Johnson spokesman, told us the bill gives states the flexibility to try ""new approaches to keeping insurance for those with pre-existing conditions affordable."" Before we close, it’s worth noting: Writing about the bill in the conservative National Review, Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, made one reference to pre-existing conditions, saying: On the positive side, supporters of the legislation correctly point out that it would give the states far more flexibility with the funds they receive, and would allow them to waive many of Obamacare’s more onerous regulations, including the mandate to buy coverage, mandated benefits and pre-existing-condition coverage requirements. Those are the regulations most responsible for driving up premiums and destabilizing insurance markets. Our rating Johnson said the GOP health bill he is co-sponsoring will protect people with pre-existing conditions ""every bit as well as Obamacare did."" The bill would keep the Affordable Care Act’s prohibition on denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions. But states could obtain waivers that would allow insurers -- unlike under Obamacare -- to charge people with pre-existing conditions premiums and provide them lesser benefits.

762,16261,"Scott Brown Says Jeanne Shaheen ""voted to pave the way for a new national energy tax.","October 24, 2014","Brown said Shaheen ""voted to pave the way for a new national energy tax."" That’s misleading. The two votes she took did mirror those of some lawmakers who favor a carbon tax, but that’s not the same thing as saying she voted to ""pave the way for a new national energy tax."" These weren’t procedural votes to commence a debate on, or tee up a final vote on, an actual carbon-tax bill. We don't see how either vote would have brought a carbon tax any closer to fruition.",Louis Jacobson,"In an Oct. 21, 2014, debate in Concord, N.H., Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and her Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, tangled over energy policy. At one point, Brown said Shaheen ""voted to pave the way for a new national energy tax."" We thought we’d take a closer look. This claim echoed, but did not precisely match, one made in a June press release by Brown’s campaign manager, Colin Reed -- that ""one year ago, Sen. Shaheen voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax."" This referred to the debate surrounding a ""carbon tax"" -- another term for taxes on oil, gas and coal usage. The logic behind the tax is that by making natural resources costlier for individuals and businesses to use, a carbon tax would encourage the use of alternative energy sources that have a smaller environmental impact. Most economists agree that a carbon tax would be effective, but the issue hasn’t gained much political traction. Brown campaign staffer Elizabeth Guyton pointed us to Shaheen’s vote on an amendment to a 2013 budget resolution put forth by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who has expressed support for implementing a carbon tax. The amendment stipulated that revenue generated by any future carbon tax must be given back to the public in some form. Shaheen voted in favor of the amendment. However, nothing in that amendment would have actually enacted a carbon tax. Rather, the amendment offered a rough framework for how money generated from such a tax, if one were ever enacted, would be put to use. ""I think that ultimately a fee on carbon pollution is inevitable, and the purpose of that amendment was to begin a discussion on that and begin the discussion about when that happens, what the best way to use the proceeds of the fee are,"" Whitehouse told reporters in 2013. ""So from that point of view, I didn’t view it as binding anybody on a carbon fee, but I did view it as an assessment of the best way of using carbon fee proceeds."" Although Shaheen was one of 41 ""yea"" votes (all of them coming from Democrats or Democratic-caucusing Independents), the vote wasn’t directly in support of a carbon tax. It would have been accurate to say Shaheen voted to ""pave the way"" for a carbon tax if she had cast a vote to -- for instance -- begin Senate debate on an actual carbon tax. But no carbon tax was waiting for a vote. The amendment she voted for wouldn’t have brought a carbon tax any closer to fruition. (And don’t forget that the measure didn’t even pass, so it’s not as if it paved the way for a tax that’s now in place.) A second piece of evidence offered by Brown’s campaign concerns an amendment proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. Blunt has emerged as a persistent carbon tax opponent in the Senate. In 2013, Blunt proposed an amendment that would have increased the threshold for passing a carbon tax framework within a budget resolution to 60 votes. Shaheen voted against this amendment, even as some of her Democratic colleagues from energy producing states voted for it. Still, it’s an exaggeration to say that Shaheen ""paved the way"" for a carbon tax when no proposal was going anywhere in the Senate. Shripal Shah, a spokesman from Shaheen’s Senate office, told us in June that Shaheen has never supported a carbon tax. Shah said Shaheen supports ""market-driven solutions"" to address pollution, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This statement seems to fall in line with the position Shaheen took when she first campaigned for the Senate in 2008. During a roundtable discussion at Seacoast Energy Alternatives in Somersworth, New Hampshire, Shaheen said she would prefer a cap-and-trade program over a carbon tax because it’s ""easier to sell to the population"" and ""puts the onus"" on the polluters. When it comes to the legislative record, Shaheen’s efforts to influence energy policy since taking office have been focused largely on boosting energy efficiency. Shaheen partnered with Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, to craft an energy efficiency bill that would launch a federal training program for energy-efficient building design and operation and establish a loan program for energy improvements to homes and small businesses, among other initiatives. The bill has twice died in the Senate. The most recent effort failed on May 12, 2014, when supporters failed to reach the 60 votes necessary to close debate on the bill and proceed to a final vote. Our ruling Brown said Shaheen ""voted to pave the way for a new national energy tax."" That’s misleading. The two votes she took did mirror those of some lawmakers who favor a carbon tax, but that’s not the same thing as saying she voted to ""pave the way for a new national energy tax.""

765,26483,"Facebook post Says the Asian, Hong Kong, swine and bird flus each “killed more people than coronavirus.”","April 14, 2020","Most of the numbers listed in the post are wrong. Regardless, it’s too soon to compare the number of COVID-19 deaths to deaths from longer-running pandemics.",Tom Kertscher,"A Facebook user suspecting a conspiracy suggests that despite global shutdowns to stem COVID-19 spread , this virus isn’t as deadly as four other historic outbreaks. ""In 1957, Asian flu killed 1 million people. In 1968, Hong Kong flu killed 1 to 4 million people. Swine flu caused 18,000 deaths, bird flu caused 75,000 deaths,"" the April 6, 2020, post says. ""All these viruses killed more people than coronavirus and yet they've never, ever shut anything down. So, what are the government not telling the public? Or, am I the only one confused by this?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As for the number of deaths, the numbers in the Facebook post are correct with respect to one outbreak. All of the other numbers are largely inaccurate. More importantly, it is too early to say what the final death toll will be for COVID-19. The pandemic is still raging and hasn’t run nearly as long as the other four outbreaks. ""The coronavirus pandemic has just begun,"" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. ""The numbers for the influenza pandemics are their complete impact over a full season and therefore not comparable to the numbers that have accrued thus far for the coronavirus pandemic."" We’ll cite the outbreaks as they are referred to by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This new influenza A, known as the Asian flu, was first reported in Singapore in February 1957, Hong Kong in April 1957 and in coastal cities in the United States in summer 1957, according to the CDC. Total estimated deaths: 1.1 million, roughly what the Facebook post claims, including 116,000 in the United States. What the post calls the ""Hong Kong flu"" was an influenza A that is believed to have originated in Hong Kong and was first noted in the United States in September 1968, according to the CDC. Total estimated deaths, according to the CDC: 1 million, including 100,000 in the United States. The post claimed the figure was 1 million to 4 million, a range Britannica.com also uses. The encyclopedia doesn’t cite a source for that range. Other sources, including GlobalSecurity.org, refer to 1 million deaths or in the range of 750,000 to 1 million deaths (Medscape medical website, Nieman Foundation for Journalism). The H1N1 influenza virus was discovered in the United States in the spring of 2009 and spread around the world. The World Health Organization declared an end to the pandemic in August 2010, according to the CDC. It was originally referred to as ""swine flu"" because many genes in the virus were similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America. Total estimated deaths: 151,700 to 575,400, far more than the 18,000 claimed in the post. An estimated 12,469 deaths occurred from April 2009 to April 2010 in the United States. What the post refers to as ""bird flu"" was not a pandemic and is an outlier in this context. Says the CDC: Avian influenza A outbreaks occur in poultry from time to time, and some of those outbreaks have been associated with illness and death in people in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and the Near East. ""While very rare, some avian influenza A viruses have also caused illness in people in North America."" The post claims 75,000 deaths from bird flu. But only 455 human deaths from avian influenza A (H5N1) were reported to the World Health Organization from 2003 to Jan. 20, 2020. None of the deaths were in the United States. The coronavirus surfaced in China in late December. According to the World Health Organization, there were 67,594 deaths, including 8,358 in the United States, as of April 6, 2020, the date of the Facebook post. There were 1,210,956 confirmed cases globally as of that date, which creates a case fatality rate of 5.6%. That’s up from a 3.4% rate cited by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director-general, at a news conference on the coronavirus on March 3, 2020. So far, it’s dramatically higher than the case fatality rates for the three pandemics listed in the Facebook post, all of which were in a range of 0.5% or less, according to the New England Journal of Medicine and Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and director of the Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University. But the rate can vary considerably during an outbreak, the World Health Organization told us. At this relatively early stage, estimating the case fatality rate is difficult for several reasons, according to an article The Lancet, a British medical journal: The virus and its clinical course are new, and we still have little information about them. Health care capacity and capability factors, including the availability of health-care workers, resources, facilities, and preparedness, affect outcomes. An unknown number of COVID-19 cases are uncounted, including people with the virus who don’t have symptoms, or people who are misdiagnosed. A Facebook post that questions the lethality of COVID-19 cites specific figures in claiming that the Asian, Hong Kong, swine and bird flus each ""killed more people than coronavirus."" The post is correct on the number of people killed only for the Asian flu. What the post calls the Asian, Hong Kong and swine flus each killed more people worldwide than COVID-19 has so far. But raw-number comparisons are meaningless, given that those pandemics each ran well over a year, and the COVID-19 outbreak is only four months old.

766,2713,"As China builds biotech sector, cash floods U.S. startups.","September 24, 2018","For three whirlwind days in June, U.S. scientist Zhi Hong went shopping at the Boston Bio Conference to find drugs to fill the pipeline of his two-week-old drug company.","Robin Respaut, Julie  Zhu","Crammed in tight, four-person booths executives use for private conversations, the former GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK.L) executive pitched dozens of U.S. biotech companies to partner with his start-up, Brii Biosciences. Months earlier, Hong had raised $260 million - much of it from Chinese and Asian investors - with a strategy to bring U.S. biotechnology drugs to China, the world’s second-largest prescription drug market and home to a rapidly growing biotech sector. Brii is now discussing partnerships with about a dozen drugmakers, which it aims to help by conducting clinical trials in China, applying for governmental approval and eventually negotiating reimbursement in a bid to capitalize on China’s stated plan to become the next global player in biopharma. “I didn’t see this coming,” Hong told Reuters. “They said, ‘If you start a company, you won’t have any problem raising money.’ I didn’t quite believe that at the beginning. But as we went through the process, it was incredible.”  Brii is one of many biotech startups riding a wave of money from Asia that so far this year has poured $4.2 billion into private U.S.-based biotech companies. That is over 43 percent of the total amount of venture funding invested in the biotech sector, according to PitchBook, up from just 11 percent in 2016. These investors range from China’s 6 Dimensions Capital and Hillhouse Capital Group to Hong Kong-based Blue Pool Capital, the investment arm of Alibaba’s executives. They are in search of better returns across the Pacific after China’s recent homegrown biotech push has driven sky-high valuations. “There are companies in China that haven’t even started clinical trials, and they have received term sheets for $400 million,” said Nisa Leung, managing partner and leader of healthcare sector at China-based Qiming Venture Partners, referring to the agreements that describe the terms of an investment. “I think that’s crazy.”  China’s biotech craze stems in part from a government plan launched a few years ago as part of the Made In China 2025 campaign. The goal is to promote biotech as a strategic emerging industry, spawning rapid development and investment into the burgeoning sector. A rule change at the Hong Kong stock exchange this spring is also providing an added incentive for investors. Biotechs without revenue or profit from around the world are now able to list on the exchange  – which provides a faster way for investors to cash out. Among the winners are Menlo Park, California’s GRAIL Inc, an early-stage cancer detection company that in May raised $300 million in a Series C round led by Chinese healthcare fund Ally Bridge Group. Immuno-oncology company TCR2 Therapeutics of Cambridge, Massachusetts, received $125 million in March in a Series B round co-led by Pacific-focused investor 6 Dimensions. In the United States, the influx of cash from China has inflated the size of biotech funding rounds and quickening the pace that companies can raise money. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2CG36Gb)  Companies that rely on licensing deals to develop innovative drugs in China - like Brii or Shanghai-based Zai Lab - are more often paying a premium. The interest from China has driven the upfront payments for licensing agreements for U.S. drugmakers to over $30 million currently from $1 million or $5 million three years ago, according to Leung. Other headwinds for Chinese biotech investment persist - ranging from the nagging threat of the Trump administration broadening restrictions on Chinese investment to the lackluster stock performance to date of the first Hong Kong biotech IPO under the new listing regime, Ascletis Pharma (1672.HK). Still many investors interviewed by Reuters do not expect China’s biotech hunger to end overnight. “It makes a lot of sense (for Chinese funds) to look at U.S. biotech firms especially as many Chinese biotechs still lag behind their U.S. peers in terms of the quality and the pipeline of products,” said Jonathan Wang, senior managing director and co-founder of the Asia fund at OrbiMed Advisors, a healthcare investment firm that continues to invest in young biotechs in both China and the United States. For some biotech companies, money from China has breathed new life into experimental drugs or devices that lost priority inside company pipelines for various reasons. That was the thinking behind scientist Bing Yao’s move to strike out on his own, just as Asia investor interest in biotech was taking off. Yao first had the idea to leave his position as the head of the respiratory, inflammation and autoimmunity disease unit at AstraZeneca MedImmune in March 2017. The pharmaceutical company was pruning its drug development to focus on priority areas like cancer, so he proposed spinning off some programs to a new start-up that he would create to develop the drugs. One year later, Yao launched Viela Bio with AstraZeneca’s blessing and six of the pharmaceutical company’s experimental drugs. The furthest along is a medicine for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, a rare disease affecting the optic nerve and spinal cord of around five in 100,000 people. Yao raised $250 million from a consortium of investors led by China-focused funds, including Boyu Capital, 6 Dimensions and Hillhouse. AstraZeneca remains the largest minority shareholder. Yao said he received interest from more investors than he wanted to manage, so he selected the firms that “came earlier and faster.”  “A few years ago, it would have been harder to raise large sums like this,” said Yao, who spent over 20 years focusing on immunology at companies like Amgen and Genentech before AstraZeneca. But it may not be as easy for companies going forward. Changes in Washington and the challenges of breaking into the Chinese healthcare sector are emerging on investor radars. A new law passed in August expanded the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign investments for potential national security concerns. The broader scope prioritizes the protection of emerging technologies, including genetic information. Even those with funding could find the China market difficult to navigate. Launching new medicines in China is still relatively untested, and conducting clinical trials, getting government approval and selling medicines in China’s segregated healthcare marketplace present formidable hurdles. “It’s a significant job,” said Moncef Slaoui, former head of global research and development and vaccines chairman at GSK and a Brii strategic advisor. “But this is a moment where there is an opportunity,” he said, because moves by the Chinese government, such as modernizing its version of the FDA, will have long-lasting impacts. At Brii, the strategy calls for working with AliHealth, the healthcare arm of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), to find potential patients for its drugs. Another deal with WuXi AppTec Co Ltd (603259.SS) gives Brii access to WuXi’s extensive research and development capabilities in China. Brii’s first U.S. biotech partnership is with San Francisco-based Vir Biotechnology, an infectious disease-focused startup headed by former Biogen CEO George Scangos. The deal grants Brii the rights to develop some of Vir’s future drugs in China. ARCH Venture Partners’ Robert Nelsen backed both companies. “Other companies try to become global,” said Hong. “We’re doing the reverse. We are dedicated 100 percent to the Chinese market.”",true,Health News

Such conflicts — few and far between — haven’t had to do with the government wanting boys to shower with girls.",W. Gardner Selby,"Sen. Ted Cruz recently veered from discussing Syria to suggesting our government wants schoolboys to shower with girls. The Republican presidential candidate commented after interviewer Steven Crowder mentioned ""genetically proper pronouns."" ""Look,"" Cruz said, ""these guys are so nutty that the federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls."" The Texan went on: ""Now listen: I’m the father of two daughters, and the idea that the federal government is coming in saying that boys, with all the god-given equipment of boys, can be in the shower room with junior high girls – this is lunacy. And I bet you there are a whole lot of parents – particularly parents of daughters – that are not eager to have the federal government saying, ‘Guess what? Your daughter has to shower with a boy, if he wants to be in there,’ "" Cruz said. A video of the conversation was posted online Nov. 19, 2015. We hadn’t heard about a push for coed showers by the government under President Barack Obama and also didn’t hear back from Cruz’s campaign about how he concluded the government is trying to let boys shower with girls. But a Nov. 22, 2015, news story in The Advocate said Cruz ""appeared to be alluding to the administration’s recent support of two separate transgender students who have sued their school districts after administrators refused to let the students use the restrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity."" Our read: Just one of the mentioned situations involves a student seeking access to locker rooms, though news stories indicate there have been other recent instances of transgender individuals seeking unfettered access to high school locker rooms. What’s a transgender person? For starters, it’s not factually accurate to say that letting transgender students into locker rooms amounts to boys being permitted to shower with girls. A transgender individual is a person whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality. Broadly, this can mean a person born a boy identifies as a girl or vice versa. A transgender also may receive hormone treatments and undertake sex reassignment surgery. Pat Griffin, a professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, advocates for including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students in college and interscholastic athletics. Griffin wrote in September 2015: ""It is important for policy-makers to understand that transgender girls (who were assigned a male gender at birth) are not boys. Their consistent and affirmed gender identity as girls is as deep-seated as the gender identity of non-transgender girls."" After we posted this fact check, readers suggested we'd failed to capture the ongoing debate over transgender rights; we followed up by writing this story. ""Student A"" in Illinois The Advocate story led us to check into the case of an Illinois transgender girl barred by her school district from changing clothes for gym class and other activities with girls. The girl, represented by the ACLU of Illinois, filed a complaint in 2013 charging sex discrimination in violation of federal law. On Nov. 2, 2015, the Office of Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education wrote the superintendent of the school district in Palatine, Ill., northwest of Chicago, saying the district’s restriction violates Title IX, the federal bar on sex discrimination in any education program or activity. The ACLU of Illinois declared the federal holding had national significance. ""The decision places school districts all across the nation on notice that Title IX requires making such facilities available for students who are transgender,"" the group said. ""It is the first such decision issued by the department, building on legal briefs and policy statements of the federal government interpreting federal laws prohibiting discrimination."" The office’s letter, signed by regional director Adele Rapport of Chicago, says ""Student A"" was born male and from a young age identified as female, transitioning in middle school ""to living full-time as a young woman"" and, among steps evidently not including sex reassignment surgery, taking ""an ongoing course of hormone therapy."" Also, the letter says, the district has given the student ""unlimited access to all girls’ restrooms in the school"" and ""allows her to participate in girls’ athletics."" According to the letter, the student, required to take a daily gym class, sought ""an opportunity to change clothes privately within the girls’ locker rooms, in an area such as a restroom stall."" The district answered that it would not be ""practicable"" to do so in the school’s six girls locker rooms ""because there were too few stalls and too many students,"" the office wrote. The letter further says the student told the office in October 2015 she’d use privacy curtains in the locker rooms if the school made them available. Talks involving the district and office did not lead to a resolution, the letter says. School district stresses private changing rooms The Palatine-based Township High School District 211 said in a Nov. 2, 2015, press release it disagreed with the department’s ruling and beyond continuing settlement negotiations, it was prepared to ""engage in all avenues of due process to determine whether our position of  honoring the rights of all the students is within the law."" The district’s release also said: ""The students in our schools are teenagers, not adults, and one's gender is not the same as one's anatomy. Boys and girls are in separate locker rooms – where there are open changing areas and open shower facilities – for a reason."" A Nov. 3, 2015, Chicago Tribune news story said the district had 30 days to reach an agreement with authorities or risk having its federal educational funding suspended or terminated and the matter also could be referred to the Department of Justice. And on Dec. 3, 2015, after Cruz made his claim, the government announced a settlement with the district agreeing to give the student access to school locker rooms ""based on the student's request to change in private changing stations"" in the rooms. Other conflicts A Nov. 2, 2015, New York Times news story on the Illinois dispute said: ""The rights of transgender students have become the focus of disputes in school districts in many states, leading to divergent approaches regarding which sports teams they can play on, bathrooms they can use and pronouns they are addressed by. In separate cases, two California school districts agreed to lift restrictions on transgender locker room and restroom access after federal officials intervened. Students at one Missouri high school protested a decision by the district to let a transgender girl use female locker rooms and restrooms."" In the Missouri instance, the Times reported Sept. 2, 2015, transgender Lila Perry, 17, used girls’ restrooms and locker rooms until a local protest led her to drop her physical education class. Professor’s take We called Griffin, the professor emeritus, who told us it’s her view that boys showering with girls is an inaccurate characterization of the government saying transgender students should, by law, have full access to school facilities including locker rooms. Griffin also called the education department’s ruling in Illinois ""the developing precedent"" nationally. Cruz’s statement, Griffin said, amounts to ""fearmongering"" and ""reflects a complete ignorance"" of transgender students, especially overlooking the fact that a transgender girl is not a boy so ""it’s not a boy in the girls’ locker room."" In contrast, Griffin said, the focus of most U.S. school officials has been on ensuring every student has a right to privacy in a locker room or restroom. Griffin, asked about state policies on transgender student-athletes, pointed us to a breakdown on Transathlete.com, which compiles policies and research regarding transgender inclusion in sports. According to the website, Texas ranks among about a dozen states with no policy ensuring transgender participation. The site touts Massachusetts’ policy, which says, in part: ""Where there are sex-segregated classes or athletic activities, including intramural and interscholastic athletics, all students must be allowed to participate in a manner consistent with their gender identity."" We also reached out to the federal education department, which did not comment on Cruz’s claim but pointed us to a Nov. 2, 2015, statement by Catherine Lhamon, an assistant secretary in the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, saying: ""All students deserve the opportunity to participate equally in school programs and activities – this is a basic civil right. Unfortunately, Township High School District 211 is not following the law because the district continues to deny a female student the right to use the girls’ locker room. The district can provide access to this student while also respecting all students’ privacy."" Our ruling Cruz said the ""federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls."" Cruz’s vision of schoolboys everywhere showering with girls grossly distorts the issue. The fact is the Obama administration has sided with transgender students seeking access to school facilities including locker rooms, holding that anything less would violate federal anti-discrimination requirements. Such conflicts — few and far between — haven’t had to do with the government wanting boys to shower with girls.

769,9453,"In a First, Gene Therapy Halts a Fatal Brain Disease","October 10, 2017","This story is one of two that we are reviewing (the other is from the Associated Press) that focuses on a recent paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine. At issue is a novel gene therapy used to limit or eliminate symptoms related to the disease adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). The New York Times story does a good job of describing everything that led up to the study, does a fair job of describing the study itself (and its results), and highlights the potential price tag of this treatment. However, the story doesn’t make clear how far this treatment is removed from widespread clinical use or the outstanding questions that remain about the treatment — such as the fact that we don’t know if the benefits are temporary. Left untreated, ALD often leads to death within 1-10 years of diagnosis. And there are precious few treatment options available. What’s more, the primary treatment, bone marrow transplantation, relies on the availability of a donor — and poses significant health risks of its own. All this makes new treatment options incredibly important for ALD patients and their loved ones. However, the fact that we are talking about the life and well-being of patients — usually children — also makes it incredibly important to place the work in context. Limitations, availability and unanswered questions are always key points worth making, and especially so when many parents are eager for information about something that may affect the health and well-being of their children.","Matt Shipman,Virginia A.

Here’s how they address the issue: “The results of the new study also give rise to a concern that is becoming a regular feature of gene therapy work and other new biotech therapies: How much will this treatment cost? Bluebird Bio is not saying…[but one scientist involved in the study] expects the price to be similar to the hundreds of thousands of dollars it costs for a bone-marrow transplant.” The story describes the outcomes for all 17 patients who were enrolled in the study, 15 of whom did not have symptoms of ALD after two years. Potential adverse effects were not adequately addressed. The story did do a good job of highlighting concerns about gene therapies in general, pointing to problems that have cropped up in previous, unrelated gene therapy trials. And it mentioned that bone marrow transplants have risks. However, it didn’t address potential harms associated with this study in particular. According to a supplement of the journal article, side effects ranged from fever and seizures to gastroenteritis. The side effects listed in the supplement also included those for one patient (2018), whose ALD symptoms worsened significantly after treatment began. It’s not clear what effect, if any, the treatment had on the relevant patient. The story does an adequate job of describing the study, but it’s missing at least one key point: Namely, the story doesn’t make clear that the study can’t prove ALD is “cured” in these patients — a longer follow-up time is needed to determine what the long-term impact of the gene therapy treatment will be. We also don’t know whether there will be significant adverse effects from the therapy (even if it is curative) in the long run. No disease mongering here. The story includes input from multiple independent sources, which is good. The story also notes that the relevant study was funded (in part) by Bluebird Bio — a company that hopes to market the relevant gene therapy. However, the story does not note that the principal investigator for the study, David Williams, has a conflict of interest. According to an appendix of the journal article, Bluebird Bio also funds other projects by Williams. The company has also licensed one of Williams’ patents. That doesn’t necessarily mean that anything in the study is shady, but conflicts of interest should be acknowledged. The story did a good job of describing other treatment options — including bone marrow and cord blood transplants — as well as the associated risks. The story doesn’t make clear that this treatment is, at the very least, years away from clinical use. The story notes only that Bluebird Bio is “in hopes of marketing gene therapy for ALD.” This line, found more than halfway through a 1,300 word story, isn’t sufficient. This is an area where the Associated Press story fared better, noting that the FDA “requires gene therapy participants to be monitored for 15 years, so these patients will continue to be studied.” The AP story also notes that Bluebird Bio “plans to seek approval of the therapy in the U.S. and Europe.” The AP was stronger on this criterion. This is a strong point for the story, which provides a fairly detailed background on how this treatment technique developed over time, how the treatment works and what sets it apart from other treatment options. The story goes well beyond a news release.",true,"ALD,gene therapy,Lorenzo's oil"
771,2433,Scientists who took chemistry into cyberspace win Nobel Prize.,"October 9, 2013",Three U.S. scientists won the Nobel chemistry prize on Wednesday for pioneering work on computer programs that simulate complex chemical processes and have revolutionized research in areas from drugs to solar energy.,"Mia Shanley, Sven Nordenstam","The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, awarding the prize of 8 million crowns ($1.25 million) to Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt and Arieh Warshel, said their work had effectively taken chemistry into cyberspace. Long gone were the days of modeling reactions using plastic balls and sticks. “Today the computer is just as important a tool for chemists as the test tube,” the academy said in a statement. “Computer models mirroring real life have become crucial for most advances made in chemistry today.”  Chemical reactions occur at lightning speed as electrons jump between atomic nuclei, making it virtually impossible to map every separate step in chemical processes involving large molecules like proteins. Powerful computer models, first developed by the three scientists in the 1970s, offer a new window onto such reactions and have become a mainstay for researchers in thousands of academic and industrial laboratories around the world. In drug design, for example, scientists can now use computers to calculate how an experimental medicine will react with a particular target protein in the body by working out the interplay of atoms. “The field of computational modeling has revolutionized how we design new medicines by allowing us to accurately predict the behavior of proteins,” said Dominic Tildesley, president-elect of Britain’s Royal Society of Chemistry. Today, all pharmaceutical companies use computational chemistry to screen experimental compounds for potential as medicines before further testing them on animals or people. The ability to model chemical reactions has also grown as computers have become more powerful, while progress in biotechnology has produced ever more complex large molecules for use in treating diseases like cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. “It has revolutionized chemistry,” Kersti Hermansson, professor in organic chemistry at Uppsala University, said of the computer modeling. “When you solve equations on the computer, you obtain information that is at such detail it is almost impossible to get it from any other method.”  “You can really follow like a movie, in time and in space. This is fantastic detail...”  Karplus, a U.S. and Austrian citizen, carries out research at the University of Strasbourg and Harvard University. Levitt, a U.S. and British citizen, is at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Warshel, a U.S. and Israeli citizen, is a professor at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. The approach has applications in industrial processes, such as materials science, the design of solar cells or catalysts used in cars. For the former, programs can be used to mimic the process of photosynthesis by which green leaves absorb sunlight and produce oxygen. It was not an easy scientific journey, however. Warshel said he had been convinced of the case for using computers to simulate chemical reactions since 1975 but did not know if he would live to see it adopted. “I always knew it was the right direction, but I had infinite difficulties and setbacks in the research. None of my papers were ever published without being rejected first,” he told Reuters. Karplus said his early work using computers was initially met coldly by many of his scientific colleagues in the ‘70s. “My chemistry colleagues thought it was a waste of time,” he told reporters at Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, adding that the next generation of scientists should be courageous and “not believe their colleagues necessarily if they say they can’t do something.”  Karplus’s family brought him to the United States in 1938 after the Nazi annexation of Austria. Austrian President Heinz Fischer said on Wednesday the Nobel Committee’s decision to award the prize to Karplus “is gratifying and at the same time an occasion to reflect on Austria’s responsibility.”  A unique insight of the trio’s work was to use computer simulations to combine quantum mechanics, which explains the making and breaking of chemical bonds, with classical Newtonian mechanics, which captures the movement of proteins. Ultimately, the ability to computerize such complex chemical processes might make it possible to simulate a complete living organism at the molecular level - something Levitt has described as one of his dreams. “I am a computer geek,” Levitt told Reuters. Back in the 1960s there were no personal computers, he said, so the only way for scientists to get their hands on a computer was to find ways to use it in their work. “That’s not to say that I became a computational chemist in order to play with computers, but a large part of any creative activity is to feel that you’re playing.”  “I think if everybody did everything with passion, the world would be a better place,” he said. Chemistry was the third of this year’s Nobel prizes. The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the will of businessman and dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel.",true,Science News
772,1667,Battle ropes become popular go-to fitness tools in U.S. gyms.,"May 25, 2015","Battle ropes, the thick and heavy ropes that look as if they could tether a ship to shore, have become go-to fitness tools in gyms for people seeking a tough workout that is also engaging and fun.",Dorene Intenicola,"Whipping, slamming, dragging and drumming the long, anchored ropes have long been used in training for sports like football, but fitness experts said they have now gone mainstream in gyms as an efficient workout routine. “It’s a little like running with the upper body,” said Jonathan Ross, spokesperson for the American Council on Exercise. “It’s not just using different muscles but training muscles in different ways.”  The Washington, D.C. area-based trainer and author of the book “Abs Revealed,” said a ropes workout engages the mind as well as the body with what he calls the grace of the wave. “The ropes show you how you’re moving,” he explained. “You see the physical manifestation of the body movement as you watch the ropes. If you do them well, your body is moving well.”  Posture and coordination are inherent elements of the workout, Ross said. Battle rope workouts also pack a calorie-burning cardio punch. A study published in the April 2015 Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research showed that a 10-minute bout of rope training resulted in high heart rates and enough energy expenditure to increase cardio respiratory fitness. Crunch, the national chain of fitness centers, has built a group fitness class around battle ropes. “It’s great core training. The abs, back, and glutes (muscles of the buttocks) are all engaged,” said Donna Cyrus, senior vice president of programming at Crunch. “Obviously there’s toning to the upper body and it burns a lot of calories.”  Rope classes typically include a warm-up segment followed by teams competing to see who can keep the wave, or movement of the rope, going the longest time. Ross said battle ropes, which come in various diameters and lengths, require shoulder mobility and stability, so people dealing with shoulder issues should use them with caution. “The longer the rope, the more challenging because you have to generate more force,” he said. “You want to see that move travel all the way down to that anchor point.”  Another mistake, he added, is pulling the ropes too tight. “You can’t make a wave if the rope is tight,” he said.",true,Health News
773,17291,We have invested record funding in protecting our environment.,"March 6, 2014","During his State of the State speech Scott said, ""We have invested record funding in protecting our environment."" After the speech, a Scott spokesman said he was referring to money directed toward springs restoration. Scott’s statement during the speech likely left  listeners with the impression that his investment in the environment in general is a record, and that would be misleading. Sorting out the total investment in environmental protection under Scott compared to predecessors is complicated because funding comes from state and federal sources and multiple state programs relate to the environment. However, under one way to compare funding - - the total for the Department of Environmental Protection -- Scott falls far short of Bush’s record. And Scott doesn’t beat Crist’s record, either. Scott tried to take his spending recommendation for one particular environmental project -- springs restoration -- and portray that as an overall record, and that’s not the case.",Amy Sherman,"So we know Gov. Rick Scott likes to portray himself as the jobs-promoter-in-chief but what about tree-hugger-in-chief? During his fourth State of the state speech March 4, Scott began by reeling off a list of recent accomplishments. ""A lot has happened since I spoke to you last year. I can talk about how our unemployment rate is now down to 6.3 percent. How our crime rate is at a 42-year low. How we have invested record funding in protecting our environment....."" Some of those numbers sounded familiar to us. But we hadn’t heard Scott’s claim that during his tenure we have invested record funding to protect the environment, so we decided to fact-check that claim. Funding to restore springs We asked Scott’s spokesman to provide us with documentation to support his claim that during his tenure Florida had invested record funding on environmental protection. Spokesman John Tupps told PolitiFact Florida in an email that Scott was referring to his proposed budget that includes a ""record $55 million"" to protect and restore springs -- ""building upon last year’s investment of more than $37 million."" Funding for springs is only a subset of funding for environmental protection, but we’ll look at the status of springs funding first. As of early March, the Legislature hadn’t voted on the amount for springs protection. It’s possible the Legislature will set an even higher amount: A coalition of Senate committee chairs drafted a bill to raise $400 million for springs from documentary stamp taxes on real estate transactions. The state has more than 1,000 freshwater springs, and many are suffering from nitrate pollution that fuels the growth of toxic algae blooms. Geologists have found an increase in saltiness in a few freshwater springs, which could signal future problems with the state's drinking supply, the Tampa Bay Times reported. In 2013, the state asked water management districts for a list of projects essential to springs restoration and received a list of about $122 million. The Legislature set aside $10 million, but the total climbed to $37 million, once other sources including local government money was included. ""If the Legislature passes Gov. Scott’s $55 million springs recommendation it will be a record level of spending for Florida’s springs,"" Eric Draper, Executive Director Audubon Florida, told PolitiFact Florida. Annual DEP funding Though Scott’s spokesman said he was referring to money proposed for springs protection, his claim was more broadly about the environment, so we asked the Department of Environmental Protection, called DEP, for the bottom-line budget total for each year during Scott’s tenure. We found similar figures back to 2004, during the tenure of his predecessors, Govs. Charlie Crist Jeb Bush. Here is the bottom line total each year: 2004-05: $2.1 billion 2005-06: $2 billion 2006-07: $2.9 billion 2007-08: $2.4 billion 2008-09: $2 billion 2009-10: $1.3 billion 2010-11: $1.4 billion 2011-12: $1.8 billion 2012-13: $1.4 billion 2013-14: $1.3 billion These numbers come with some caveats: they are appropriation numbers, not actual expenditures, and they combine state and federal dollars. In several of those years, the numbers included debt service payments of more than $400 million. It’s no surprise that the dollar amounts were higher in flush financial times under Bush and part of Crist’s term and then plummeted along with the economy in the second half of Crist’s tenure and Scott’s tenure. We have seen the same pattern for other state spending priorities. Spokespersons for DEP and Scott also cited other environmental projects Scott has supported -- including an $880 million water quality plan to provide clean water to the Everglades. Facing the prospect of court-ordered cleanup, in 2012 the state reached a settlement with the federal government to end a long-standing dispute about Everglades cleanup. All of the $880 million won’t be spent this year; it is a 13-year agreement. For this year, Scott proposed $130 million for Everglades, which includes part of that $880 million, as well as other state and water management district sources. ""Scott has skillfully negotiated the Everglades deal with EPA, which gives him a talking point of boosting environmental programs in Florida,"" said Jerry Phillips, a DEP attorney in the 1990s who is now an environmental watchdog. ""But the reality is that Bush and Crist had been negotiating with EPA for years as well, on issues such as the Everglades."" Environmental cuts The total DEP budget doesn’t tell the full story because other agencies also do work that relates to protecting the environment. We interviewed several environmentalists who pointed to Scott’s lack of investment in protecting the environment. We will cite some of their examples: • In 2011 Scott and the Legislature abolished the Department of Community Affairs, which for decades reviewed development plans in cities and counties. • In 2011, Scott and lawmakers forced state water management districts to slash property tax collections. The South Florida Water Management District’s total budget dropped from about $1 billion in 2011 to $622 million in 2014. Water management districts handle planning for water resources and wetlands protection, among other environmental issues. • In December 2012, DEP laid off 58 employees. • The number of enforcement cases handled by DEP has dropped dramatically, from 2,289 in 2010 (Crist’s final year) to 799 in 2012, the Tampa Bay Times reported. As of the end of May, only 145 new cases had been filed. • For many years the Legislature invested $300 million a year in Florida Forever, a program to buy land with money from a tax on real estate transactions. During the economic downturn, the Legislature pulled back. In 2010, Crist’s final year, the program received $15 million. In 2011, Scott proposed zeroing out Florida Forever (it ultimately got $744,000), and then in 2012 he signed a budget that included about $8 million. In 2013, lawmakers approved $20 million and directed the state to sell off $50 million worth of land to generate additional dollars. In March, DEP scrapped the program without selling an acre. Scott has proposed $70 million for next year -- that includes $40 million from the sale of non-conservation lands. Frank Jackalone, Sierra Club’s Senior Organizing Manager in Florida, said Scott’s claim is ""disconcerting"" because of the various cuts. ""You have to take all that into account when you run budget numbers,"" he said. ""It sounds to me like Scott’s people are coming up with their own selective set of budget figures. ... He doesn’t have environmental creds as far as I am concerned."" Our ruling During his State of the State speech Scott said, ""We have invested record funding in protecting our environment.""

As you can see, it’s a party atmosphere and everyone is just enjoying the spectacle,” said Rosalind Von Wendt from Los Angeles. More than 1,500 people gathered at the observatory near the city’s famous Hollywood sign to watch the eclipse. However, not everyone got to watch the cosmic show, with lunar eclipse parties canceled elsewhere due to a flash freeze across the central and northeastern United States. Icy roadways rather than cloudy skies were blamed by astronomers for spoiling the festivities. In Los Angeles, where the weather was markedly warmer and skies cleared just in time, skywatchers were treated to a full spectacle of the Earth casting its shadow over the moon’s face. “Oh it was fantastic, it was great,” said Brad Mortensen, from Philadelphia, Pa. “This was a great location. The observatory is always fun to visit so tonight when we heard about this we decided to come up.”  The moon did not vanish entirely during the total eclipse but, at its height, the entire lunar surface was bathed in a reddish-orange glow that gives rise to the “blood moon” description. The reddish color is due to rays of sunlight passing through Earth’s dusty, polluted atmosphere as the moon falls into our planet’s shadow. The shorter, more pliable blue wavelengths of light are scattered outside the Earth’s shadow and the longer, less bendable red wavelengths are refracted toward the moon. Adding to the visual effect is the fact that the eclipse occurred at a time when the moon reached a point in its orbit putting it close to Earth, an alignment called a supermoon. It has also earned the name “wolf moon” because it appears in January, when wolves would howl in hunger outside villages early in U.S. history, according to The Farmers Almanac. Sunday’s eclipse reached its maximum effect over Los Angeles shortly after 9 p.m. Pacific time (0500 GMT Monday), but not everyone on the West Coast had a clear view. It rained in San Francisco and San Diego had cloudy skies. Astronomy buffs were urged to watch the eclipse livestreamed online at sites such as AstronomersWithoutBorders.org. It seemed days earlier that cloudy skies would be the biggest threat to the cosmic fun, but it turned out a wet, wide-ranging snowstorm followed by a deep freeze on Sunday made driving and outdoor activities too hazardous. Eclipse parties were canceled from Indiana’s Lemon Lake County Park to New Jersey’s Rowan University. “It’s not the snow or cloudy skies but, rather, the extreme cold and what we fear may be hazardous travel conditions,” said Pennsylvania’s Carbon County Environmental Center, which scrapped its party in Summit Hill, Pennsylvania, 54 miles (86 km) northwest of Allentown. The eclipse was otherwise visible to the naked eye by anyone in the United States where skies were clear. That included Atlanta, Ga., where only the determined went outside in freezing temperatures to watch. Unlike a solar eclipse, which requires eye protection to enjoy the view safely, no extra measures need to be taken for hazard-free lunar eclipse watching. The next chance for Americans to see a total lunar eclipse is 2022. The best viewing of the one-hour total eclipse was from North and South America, with as many as 2.8 billion people able to see it from the Western Hemisphere, Europe, West Africa and northernmost Russia.",true,Science News

An infographic from KIRO-TV in Seattle offers some clarity. According to the graphic, which was published March 18 on Facebook, the coronavirus can live for ""up to 3 hours in the air, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard up to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But in this case, the latest research backs it up — so keep washing your hands and disinfecting your home. The graphic cites an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17. Researchers tested how long the coronavirus, formally called SARS-CoV-2, lived on five different surfaces: aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard. ""SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours),"" the authors wrote. ""SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard."" Aside from air, the worst surface for the virus is copper; researchers could only detect viable virus particles there for up to four hours. On cardboard, they could not detect any after 24 hours. The coronavirus lives the longest on plastic and stainless steel — up to three days. It’s worth noting that the article is not a peer-reviewed study, and researchers tested the lifespan of SARS-CoV-2 in a lab setting. But their findings reflect what others have found about the potential longevity of the coronavirus outside the body. How Long Coronavirus Stays Active on Surfaces⁠ ⁠ A new unpublished, un-peer reviewed analysis has received some attention in recent days for its findings that the #COVID19 virus can remain viable in the air for up to 3 hours, on copper for up to 4 hours, on cardboard up to 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel up to 2 to 3 days. ⁠ ⁠ To date, there have been no published studies specifically looking at the novel #Coronavirus but there was research published this past February in The Journal of Hospital Infection which analyzed several dozen previously published papers on human coronaviruses. While it did not include #COVID_19, it may provide a better idea of how long this pathogen can survive outside of the body. ⁠ ⁠ The authors concluded that if this new coronavirus resembles other human coronaviruses, such as its ""cousins"" that cause #SARS and #MERS, it can stay on surfaces — such as metal, glass or plastic — for as long as nine days. ⁠ ⁠ This is in comparison to flu viruses which can last on surfaces for only about 48 hours.⁠ ⁠ But there are some important caveats to consider. Some #coronavirus don't remain active for as long at temperatures higher than 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius). ⁠ ⁠ The authors also found that coronaviruses can be effectively wiped away by common household disinfectants. ⁠ ⁠ For now that is the best information we have.⁠ ⁠ To follow the continually updated coronavirus dashboard, tap the link in our bio and bookmark the page.⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ A post shared by  Medscape (@medscape) on Mar 17, 2020 at 2:29am PDT An article published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in March reviewed what other scientists have found about how long human coronaviruses can survive on different surfaces. The authors found that viruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which are both similar to COVID-19, could live for a couple of days on steel, plastic, wood, paper and glass surfaces. What about money, which many Americans handle every day? The World Health Organization advises people to wash their hands with soap and water after handling banknotes, coins and credit cards. The Journal of Hospital Infection article says human coronaviruses could live on paper for anywhere between one to five days. The U.S. Dollar is made up of 75% cotton and 25% linen, as opposed to wood pulp, which is the base for most paper. Still, you’re probably safer handling coins. The New England Journal of Medicine article found that COVID-19 can only survive for up to four hours on copper, which is what quarters, nickels and dimes are primarily made of. Ironically, pennies are made primarily of zinc, although they have a copper exterior. Based on the information available, KIRO-TV’s infographic is accurate.

But the vast charging network needed to sustain their vision is patchy, and it’s not clear who’ll pay for it.",Adriel Bettelheim,"The central German city of Ruesselsheim, home to carmaker Opel, wants to build 1,300 electric car charging points by 2020, plans that would make it a frontrunner on the continent. It has advantages enjoyed by few in Europe, including a powerful local car industry player and wealthy national economy. In Germany itself the city has an edge, having won a government grant of 12.8 million euros ($14.4 million) to fund the rollout. Yet, even here, red tape, shortages of qualified staff and the requisite hardware are likely to delay the installation by around two years, local officials told Reuters. The project will also need more money, said the officials who are running up against the complexity of civil engineering, potential power grid overloads and unwieldy payment processes, illustrating some of the difficulties facing cities and nations across Europe. “We are not doing this for profit,” said Marianne Floersheimer, Ruesselsheim council’s mobility chief. “But we cannot afford to top up the government money.”  The number of electric cars on German roads grew fivefold between 2015 and 2018, and have risen strongly across Europe. However the growth in electric cars is outpacing the charging infrastructure. The ratio of electric cars to each charging point in Europe deteriorated to 7.0 from 6.1 in the same period, consultants AlixPartners found, although Europe is still better equipped than the United States at 19.7 per car, and China’s 7.6. Some analysts say a lag in infrastructure could drag on sales as customers hold off until electric becomes a convenient option. Any logjam could prove a problem for carmakers which, faced with emissions penalties, are pumping tens of billions of euros into electric technology in an industry-wide charge. German champion Volkswagen, for example, aims for electric vehicles to account for about a quarter of its sales by 2025. Obstacles to electrification could also strain the European Union’s plan to become “carbon neutral” by 2050 to combat climate change. A quarter of climate-harming emissions come from transport and, within that, most from passenger cars. However some campaigners, including Transport & Environment, a group that promotes clean transport, say good progress is being made in rolling out charging points in many countries of western and northern Europe, although central and eastern Europe are further behind. They say limited infrastructure is not having a significant effect on Europe’s electric car sales, which still represent a fraction of the vehicle market, and the ratio of cars to points is within the EU recommendation of 10. Given most charging will be done at home, they add, a lack of off-street parking in some areas could deter drivers from switching to electric. Like other German cities, Ruesselsheim is under pressure to roll out charging stations as environmental activists have started suing those municipalities that fail to comply with EU-wide rules for nitrogen dioxide emissions. With just 67,000 people, it has only a few charging points at the moment, some way behind the likes of wealthy and populous Hamburg on about 880 and Berlin with some 780. It is however aiming to provide one charging point per 72 people, the highest level in Europe, with the help of carmaker Opel, which will build around half of the points, plus the technical know-how of the local RheinMain University. Opel is owned by France’s PSA Group. Ruesselsheim’s electric plan won one of the highest grants under the German transport ministry’s clean air program. But local officials described some of the complications in implementation. The installation of every charging point needs to be agreed with authorities such as those in charge of water, monument protection and civil engineering, for example. Charging equipment makers, meanwhile, have long lead times. “We are chasing the same charging points, employees and supply technology as all the other cities,” said city spokesman Asswin Zabel. Hooking up inner-city charging points on low voltage lines will be relatively easy although some local people may object, said Matthias Schweitzer, head of technology at the local utility, Stadtwerke Ruesselsheim. But laying 2 km of medium voltage lines and ordering new transformer substations could take up to nine months, he said. The university aims to accompany the rollout with storage facilities to absorb green power and offer supply on demand. But it must measure whether inverters, which turn alternating current power from the grid into direct current used by car batteries, cause too much stress on the network. “We must ensure there is no overload,” Schweitzer added. Yet more snags await: There is still a hodge-podge of charging and paying processes across the country as vendors are not in sync with each other, meaning Ruesselsheimers may encounter payment difficulties on longer journeys. “There is no obligation to provide free roaming. People have to carry around far too many different customer cards,” said Hanns Koenig of research firm Aurora, which has studied commercial car charging opportunities. Germany is doing relatively well in Europe in terms of public charging points, with 17,400 countrywide, according to data from energy industry association BDEW. That would roughly equate to a point for every five of its 83,000 electric cars, about 1 percent of the vehicles on its roads. To keep up with sales, BDEW says thousands more public charging points are needed in coming years, as well as hundreds of thousands of private points at homes and workplaces. However funding could be a central problem in Germany, as well as in Europe and beyond, particularly along motorways which do not fall under any particular municipality. Carmakers are largely pouring much of their money into the development of electric vehicles, while energy providers hesitate to take on responsibility for the rollout as long as car sales remain too low to provide a profitable customer base. In Germany, many of the roughly 1,500 local utility players simply cannot shoulder huge infrastructure costs, especially while commercial success is not assured. The situation could become a vicious circle, some industry experts say, since without a large number of charging stations, customers may be reluctant to make the leap to electric. “Today it is still largely unclear who will make the necessary investment in the charging infrastructure in cities, housing and along the motorways in the short term, and how these can refinance themselves in the medium and long term,” said Jens Haas, managing director automotive at AlixPartners. “This results in lasting scepticism among German car customers and, in turn, hesitant buying.”",true,"National, Civil Rights, Terrorism, Bob Barr, "

Their existence was only recently discovered and has fascinated scientists worldwide. Evidence was first uncovered in 2008 in a cave in Siberia, and today it includes only three teeth, a pinky bone and a lower jaw, said Hebrew University genetics professor Liran Carmel. It sounds like science fiction, but Carmel said that was enough to create a depiction of a full Denisovan skeleton. “This is the first time that we provide a detailed anatomical reconstruction showing us what these humans looked like,” he said. It turns out, Carmel said, “we are all very similar.”   His team developed a technology to decipher the ancient DNA and, more importantly, its gene activity. Gene activity, for example, differentiates between a frog and tadpole, even though their DNA is identical, Carmel said. DNA could indicate the Denisovan’s dark skin, eyes and hair, Carmel said, but by mapping gene activity patterns, they could infer how the species stood out anatomically from modern humans or Neanderthals. They identified 56 traits, most in the skull, that differed. This helped them produce a rendering - claiming 85% accuracy - of a Denisovan skeleton that at first glance looks like it could be from a modern human, though differences are obvious on closer inspection. There were similarities to Neanderthals - a sloping forehead, long face and large pelvis - but the Denisovans were also unique in their very wide skull and large dental arch. The skeletal reconstruction, along with an artist’s rendering of the 13-year-old girl’s head and face, were published in the journal Cell. The team repeated the process as a test with Neanderthals and chimpanzees, whose anatomies are known, and found the reconstruction to be 85% accurate. The discovery of more Denisovan DNA would further improve the rendering. Some far-flung modern Asian populations possess small but significant amounts of DNA derived from Denisovans, suggesting they had a broad geographical presence. Research suggests that Denisovan DNA may have contributed to modern Tibetans’ ability to live in high altitudes and the Inuits’ ability to withstand freezing temperatures.",true,Science News
785,9122,Anti-gravity treadmills get patients running again after knee surgery,"July 11, 2017","Researchers in the UK presented a single case study of a 39-year-old runner who had surgery on her knee followed by physical therapy using a special treadmill. The release claimed the “anti-gravity” treadmill, which reduces the pressure of weight on the knee, helped this patient reduce fears about re-injury and increase their confidence in their ability to run again. The release did not provide any data to support that claim. The release would have been stronger had it included a mention of the cost and availability of anti-gravity treadmills. They’re very expensive pieces of equipment but are becoming more widely available through rehabilitation clinics. Knee pain is a very common condition and often keeps people from activities, including exercise, that are known to promote overall health. This news release about a single patient’s recovery from surgery overstates the benefit of the “anti-gravity” treadmill by implying that because this patient recovered better after using the machine, that others might, too. Studying a single patient, without comparison to a control group, cannot prove this treadmill improves outcomes. As we’ve said in a recent blog post, case studies should not be used as proof of health outcomes.","Sally James,Christopher Labos, MD,Kathlyn Stone","The release makes no mention of costs of the “space age” treadmill device. We found at least one anti-gravity treadmill has been around since 2005. The machines sell for between $24,500 and $70,000. Most people who would want to use them would be referred to a rehabilitation clinic where it may cost about $80 to run on one for 55 minutes. The release does not offer any units of measurement to describe the benefits. The descriptions of benefits also lean pretty heavily on abstractions that are tricky to measure. In the following example, the benefits are “a great environment for healing” and “belief” that a patient can make a successful return. “Not only does the tailored anti-gravity treadmill programme provide a great environment for healing, it also helps the person restore their belief that they can make a successful return to the sport they love.” In another example, the researcher is paraphrased as saying the machine could be helping to “reduce fears about re-injury and increase self-belief.” Basically they are saying that the runner re-gained some confidence in running. This cannot be extended to generalizations about health outcomes. The release does not mention any potential harms. As we outlined in benefits above, this release is written about a single case study of a single patient. The reader does not have enough information about the evidence to judge the quality. The release does not explain how the study measured the patient’s attitude or knee recovery. We’re only told that the therapy last 8 weeks. We did look at the published study which explained the measurements. But they aren’t included in the release. There was no disease mongering. The release doesn’t say if the author received funding to complete the case study. It also doesn’t give readers any information about potential conflicts of interest, or the absence of any, between the study authors and anti-gravity treadmill manufacturers. The release doesn’t mention any alternatives to the treadmill for people needing rehabilitation after knee surgery. The release is about a study of a single patient who pursued a single rehab journey following surgery. Besides that limitation, the news release also missed an opportunity to mention that there are non-surgical approaches to treating cartilage damage in the knee. The release does not tell us whether the device is available anywhere outside of the specific physical therapy facility profiled in the case study. The release doesn’t tell us how this case study yields anything new beyond the previous research completed on anti-gravity treadmills used in rehabilitation.

The victims ranged in age from 6 to 93 years old, Bill Harris, coroner for storm-ravaged Lee County, told a morning news conference. “Just keep these families in your prayers,” Harris said. Most of the deceased were found in close proximity to their homes. The four children were age 6, 8, 9 and 10, officials said. County Sheriff Jay Jones said on Tuesday that search crews had narrowed their scope down to “the most affected areas” after scouring much of the county on Monday. He said he hoped the search and rescue effort would become a recovery effort by the end of the day. U.S. President Donald Trump said he will visit the areas of Alabama that were devastated by the tornadoes on Friday. “It’s been a tragic situation,” Trump said at the White House before a ceremony on military veteran suicides. “But a lot of good work is being done. I’m in constant touch with the governor and also the governor of Georgia.”  The tornadoes, stirred up by a late-winter “supercell” thunderstorm, toppled mobile homes and uprooted massive trees on Sunday with 170 mile-per-hour (274 km-per hour) winds. Forecasters ranked the worst of the outbreak at step four of the six-step Enhanced Fujita scale of tornado strength. The Beauregard community in the twister’s path might have had as few as eight or nine minutes to seek shelter from the time the warning was issued, National Weather Service chief meteorologist Chris Darden said. In addition to 23 confirmed deaths, more than 50 people were reported injured, authorities said, making this the deadliest tornado outbreak since a massive tornado struck Moore, Oklahoma, in May 2013, killing 24 people and injuring 375 others.",true,Environment
791,2409,New York City Council votes to add e-cigarettes to smoking ban.,"December 20, 2013","The New York City Council voted to add electronic cigarettes to the city’s strict smoking ban on Thursday, in what could be the latest of many anti-tobacco measures put in place by outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg.",Curtis Skinner,"Bloomberg’s detractors have derided him for trying to impose a “nanny state” in America’s largest city, pointing to his bans on smoking, trans fats and the attempt to limit the sale of large sugary drinks. Public health advocates have applauded those same efforts. Only weeks after New York became the first major city to raise the legal age for buying tobacco to 21, the City Council voted 43-8 to add electronic cigarettes to the city’s Smoke-Free Air Act. If the mayor signs the bill, which he is expected to do, smoking e-cigarettes - or “vaping” - would be prohibited at public and private venues such as beaches, parks, restaurants and office buildings after 120 days. City Council speaker, Christine Quinn, who sponsored the bill, said at a press conference on Thursday that the public use of e-cigarettes threatens to undermine enforcement of anti-smoking laws because their appearance is similar to traditional cigarettes and could “re-normalize smoking in public places.”  E-cigarettes are slim, reusable metal tubes that contain nicotine-laced liquid in a variety of exotic flavors such as bubble gum and bacon. As a “smoker” puffs on the device, the nicotine is heated and releases a vapor that, unlike cigarette smoke, contains no tar, which is known to cause cancer and other diseases. Critics of the law contend that such a ban would do more harm than good. Richard Carmona, a former U.S. Surgeon General and a current board member at NJOY, one of America’s largest electronic cigarette manufacturers, sent a letter to the council recently to urge rejection of the bill. “I’m extremely concerned that a well-intentioned but scientifically unsupported effort like the current proposal to include electronic cigarettes in New York’s current smoking ban, could constitute a giant step backward in the effort to defeat tobacco smoking,” Carmona wrote. The debate over risks versus benefits of e-cigarettes is far from settled, but a study published recently in the British medical journal, The Lancet, said they are as effective as nicotine patches for smokers trying to kick the habit. Three states - Utah, North Dakota and New Jersey - have already passed legislation banning e-cigarettes wherever smoking is prohibited.",true,Health News
793,33381,A photograph shows an STD-related infection known as 'blue waffle disease.',"April 1, 2013","One common variation on the blue waffle myth is that it is an STI that passes exclusively from females to males and can be caused by improper hygiene. Perhaps this seems somewhat indicative of our society’s tendency to blame, objectify, and vilify women.",David Mikkelson,"In April 2013, New Jersey city councilperson Kathy McBride became the object of some derision when, according to the Trentonian, she reported at a city council meeting that she had received an “alarming call” from a constituent who wanted to know “what was the City of Trenton doing about an epidemic that’s called the Blue Waffle Disease?” McBride was mocked for taking the issue seriously and not recognizing that she had apparently been taken in by an April Fool’s prank. References to “Blue Waffle Disease” hit the Internet around March 2010 when an image (disturbing image warning) of scabbed, blue-tinted labia was circulated along with the claim that the image pictured a type of vaginal infection resulting from a sexually transmitted disease (a condition which was supposedly common enough that it had been identified and given the slang name “blue waffle disease”): There is a rumor going around about a new STD called “Blue Waffle.” “A ‘waffle’ is a slang term for a vagina. A ‘blue waffle’ is a slang term for a severe vaginal infection. It’s basically a slang term for an extremely nasty or severe vaginal infection/STD on the vagina. The infection could cause lesions on the outside of the vagina, as well as bruising, which causes it to look blue in color.” Much discussion ensured about whether the photograph was real or a digital manipulation, and, if the former, whether it really pictured an infection (rather than, say, bruising resulting from rape or some other form of trauma). Whatever the origins of the photo, “blue waffle disease” is a bit of fiction and not a known symptom or result of any type of STD-related infection. As reported in the Women’s Health Foundation blog, Dr. Amy Whitaker, an Assistant Professor of Obstetrics/Gynecology at the University of Chicago Hospital, said of the widely circulated “blue waffles” image that: There is no disease known as “blue waffle disease,” in the medical world. There is no disease that causes a blue appearance on the external genitalia. I had never heard of this until you wrote to our section and asked about it. The common belief among medical professionals with whom I have spoken or e-mailed about this is that it is a hoax; the picture and “fake” disease used to lure people into some web site. The picture itself is disturbing. It is possible that a bluish appearance to external genitalia could be from bruising, which could result from force, most likely from a sexual assault. I can’t say, obviously, if that is the case here, but bruising certainly wouldn’t be bright blue. No STDS cause external bruising. Additionally, there appears to be one or two lesions, which could be an STD of some sort (for example, a herpes lesion), although it is certainly not clear from the picture. It even appears that there might be some sort of laceration on her right labia, a “cut” of sorts, but again it’s unclear. That could also be from force, or it could be an STD that presents with a lesion on the vulva. On the other hand, the entire thing could be ‘photoshopped,’ and nothing in it represents anything ‘real.’ In any case, this is not the typical appearance of any STD or any condition of the vagina or vulva. Columbia University’s Go Ask Alice! Health column also notes that “blue waffle disease” is a hoax: “Blue waffle,” or “blue waffle disease,” is many things, but real is not one of them. It is an urban legend, a myth, a tall tale, a rumor, a hoax, etc. about a fictional sexually transmitted infection (STI). If you do an image search, you’ll find (fake) pictures of blue waffle on the Internet. The blue refers to one of the alleged symptoms, and waffle is slang for vagina. Other supposed symptoms of blue waffle vary depending on the source and so does how it’s spread, all of the details changing over time like a giant game of telephone. One reason the blue waffle myth may have spread so quickly is because of the fear and confusion surrounding STIs and sexual health. Symptoms associated with the imaginary blue waffle are reminiscent to symptoms of existing conditions or STIs. For example, a red or irritated vagina or vulva, smelly discharge, and itching or burning could all be signs of bacterial vaginosis (or vaginitis). Sores and lesions? Now it sounds more like herpes. Why blue? Perhaps this can be explained by the darker color of the clitoris and inner lips when increased blood flow due to arousal occurs in some women. Or perhaps a darker bluish color could be caused by a yeast infection or chronic irritation of the vulva, known as Lichen simplex.",false,"Risqué Business, blue waffle disease, Medical Myths, sexually transmitted disease"
795,9167,Allergan Reports Topline Phase II Data Supporting Advancement of BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) for the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD),"April 11, 2017","This news release from Allergan reports results of a phase II clinical trial of botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) as a treatment for major depressive disorder. The study compared effectiveness of two different dosages of botox with placebo in women for up to 24 weeks of treatment. The release states that the 30-unit dose was superior to the placebo at three and nine weeks, but not at six weeks. The 50-unit dose was not superior to placebo. The heading claims that the results support advancement of botox into larger phase lll trials, but further into the release we learn there was no statistically significant difference between treatment and placebo at the predetermined goal of six weeks. Additionally, the lower dose arm of the study outperformed the higher dose. As written, the heading and some introductory material are misleading. With mental health concerns more and more in the spotlight of health policy in the United States, an effective treatment for depression would be important news. Current treatments for depression help about two-thirds of those with significant depression symptoms. A treatment with a different mechanism of action such as botox to help some treatment resistant patients would be a welcome addition to the therapeutic toolbox. However, this news release obscures the study results. Botox has already been promoted for “off label” use to treat depression for some time. HealthNewsReview.org has previously explored the marketing of botox for depression and other conditions.","Ann Miller, PhD,Susan Molchan, MD, MA,Kathlyn Stone","No mention is made of the cost of botox. GoodRx lists one 100-unit vial of botox selling for around $615 on average in the United States. We really don’t have a good idea from the release of the degree of benefit. Some numbers provided trend towards statistical significance, but there is a big difference between statistical significance and clinical significance. How much of a change in these rating scales makes a difference to the way a patient is really feeling such that it makes a difference in their lives? Also the fact that one dose of the drug seemed to provide effects and the other higher dose didn’t calls into question the whole idea of why botox may work for depression. The theory is that by paralyzing certain muscles in the face, botox affects emotions often reflected in those muscles. So shouldn’t some benefit be present or comparable at the higher doses? No mention is made of possible negative side effects. According to MayoClinic.com, possible side effects include “pain, swelling or bruising at the injection site, headache or flu-like symptoms, droopy eyelid or cockeyed eyebrows, crooked smile or drooling, eye dryness or excessive tearing.” In rare cases, the effect of botulinum toxin can spread to other parts of the body and cause botulism-like signs and symptoms. Information is provided about the study design (a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single treatment study), the number of study volunteers (258 adult women), the proportion of people in each arm of the study, and the length of the trial. But the release seems to go to pretty significant lengths to conceal the fact that the primary outcome was negative. It introduces the results with the sentence: “The BOTOX® 30 U dose demonstrated numerically superior efficacy in MADRS total score compared to placebo.” However, the release itself indicates that is not true. At the predetermined endpoint of six weeks, there was no statistically significant difference between either dose of botox and the placebo groups. We also have concerns about the headline which announces that the results support advancement of botox for treatment of major depressive disorder. That’s a stretch. Other outside experts have called these results mixed at best, unimpressive at worst. The release does not engage in disease mongering, but nor does it provide us with any context about major depressive disorder or describe how botox works to reduce depression symptoms. It is clearly stated that the study was funded by Allergan, the same company that produces botox. The article makes no comparison between botox and current treatments for depression so we’re left wondering: what does botox bring to the table? How does its benefits compare with medication? Does botox have fewer side effects? Does it cost less than other therapies? Readers are given no context within which to interpret the news. No statement is made about the availability of botox, but readers can reasonably assume that it will continue to be widely available. Allergan is not the first to test the effectiveness of single doses of botox to treat depression. Other researchers have conducted small, placebo-controlled studies with encouraging results, and a mention of the previous research should have been included in the release. The release doesn’t rely on sensational language.",false,"Allergan,Botox,major depressive disorder"

Each of the stories in some way attributed its information to the South West News Service, which describes itself as a ""UK- and US-based news and media content agency with a proud 40-year history."" These stories and other posts with the same claim were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) With fewer than 300 reported cases and zero deaths, Vietnam has been highlighted for its response to COVID-19, which included strict quarantining and intensive testing. Much of the country has reopened, with children returning to school May 4. While Vietnam has grappled with real issues related to animal welfare, experts we spoke to say they haven’t found widespread evidence that black cats are being killed and turned into a paste to treat COVID-19. The news service that generated the story said it has removed the article from circulation amid concerns about its credibility. Here’s what we know. On April 17, The Sun, a tabloid in the United Kingdom and Ireland, published a story that reported on an investigation by an animal rights group called Four Paws. According to the story, the group said it examined dining app data and found that dog and cat meat sales were surging through dining app delivery services in Cambodia and Vietnam. The story surmised that ""doctors in the region are encouraging many to eat dog and cat meat, claiming its properties help fight off viruses."" A week later, on April 23 and 24, stories credited to the South West News Service were published elsewhere that had a similar storyline, but took the claim further to suggest black cats are being singled out, turned into paste and consumed as medicine. Pictures credited to South West News Service accompanied some versions of the online stories. But the captions were vague and the images hard to verify. They included, for example, a photo of a baby drinking from a bottle that appears to contain a black substance. ""This distressing image shows a baby reportedly being fed the black cat concoction,"" the caption said. The stories’ only source appeared to be the head of another charity, No to Dog Meat, based in London. We reached out to that group for evidence. They sent us to their YouTube account which includes four videos uploaded in April and May that claim in captions or titles to show cat mistreatment in Vietnam but which included no verifiable information about exactly where or when they were taken. Asked about the black cat claim, Cat Besch, founder and director of Hanoi-based Vietnam Animal Aid & Rescue, told PolitiFact she has seen ""zero evidence in Vietnam so far that this is true."" Nam Nguyen, an editor in Vietnam with the government-run Vietnam News Agency, told PolitiFact ""the rumor has been around these weeks and originated from one post in Thailand social media, but as far as I know, Vietnamese are not so superstitious like other nations in southeast Asia to practice those ancient rites."" He said the post has been deleted. Phuong Tham, director of Human Society International in Vietnam, told PolitiFact that black cats are being killed there ""by people with lack of knowledge, believing that black cats' bones can treat asthma in children, while others kill them for superstitious beliefs,"" but ""we have seen no evidence that black cats in Vietnam are being killed for COVID-19 treatment."" Tham and Dr. Todd Pollack, Harvard University medical professor and country director in Hanoi of the Partnership for Health Advancement in Vietnam, said it is significant that they had not seen the claim reported by news organizations in Vietnam. VN Express, a newspaper in Vietnam, reported that on May 6, police in Nghe An province seized 630 kilograms of dog, cat carcasses and entrails of other animals from a passenger bus. The driver said the meat was being taken to Hanoi for consumption, according to the report. But the report contains no suggestion the meat was being used for treatment of coronavirus. When we reached out to South West News Service about the source of the information, the agency told PolitiFact that ""shortly after publication, we identified a number of issues with this story and pulled it from our service. We received new information which led us to doubt the widespread nature of the claims the charity had made on this issue.""

801,22073,"Next year, ""you will be mandated by federal law to get rid of your existing light bulbs.","May 20, 2011",Conservative group claims new law would require people to throw away existing light bulbs and replace with more efficient ones,Robert Farley,"A fundraising letter making the rounds from a conservative political action committee draws a political line in the sand over light bulbs. The letter, circulated by AmeriPAC, a political action committee that largely supports conservative Republican candidates, claims President Barack Obama is ""banning"" incandescent light bulbs in favor of compact fluorescent lighting. It includes a lengthy letter purported to be written by Ron Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund. ""A silly little light bulb is merely a small piece of the larger puzzle of global socialism that he feels is his agenda to enslave the American people -- and to choke Americans from a free enterprise system!"" the letter states. The letter seeks contributions and support for S.B. 395, the Better Use of Light Bulbs (BULB) Act, sponsored by Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., which seeks to repeal the light bulb efficiency standards included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. We're writing about several claims in the letter, but here, we wanted to set the record straight on one of its worst inaccuracies. ""Next year your light bulbs will be obsolete,"" the letter reads. ""You will be mandated by federal law to get rid of your existing light bulbs."" A few paragraphs later, the letter hits on the same idea, stating, ""Next year you will be required to trade in -- whoops...throw away...your trusty incandescent light bulbs so you will supposedly be 'environmentally-safe' with much more expensive Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs)."" Sec. 321 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 spells out the new standards for light bulbs, essentially requiring them to be 25 percent more efficient. The idea is that, over time, more efficient light bulbs will replace older, less efficient ones. But there is nothing in the bill that requires you to get rid of the light bulbs you've got. Rather, the bill sets standards for new light bulbs ""manufactured or imported"" to the United States. Just to be sure, we asked Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, who said, ""The standards apply to bulbs being imported or manufactured after the standards go into effect."" Not only can people keep using their existing bulbs, she said, stores can continue to sell the old ones -- even after the new standards are in place -- until they are sold out. ""There are no energy police coming to your home to make you remove your light bulbs,"" scoffed Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. We asked Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund, who is purported to have penned the letter, about the claim. Initially, Arnold told us ""that's probably not a very good way to put that. I could have been more careful with that."" Then he said he didn't recall including such a phrase in his letter at all. When we sent him a copy of the letter we received, he said it was ""an earlier version that was sent out by AmeriPAC, which had no reason to believe it was wrong in any part."" Arnold attached another version of the letter, the one he said CDFE sent out, and it words the claim a little more carefully: ""Democrats in Congress have mandated that you must give up using traditional light bulbs all because environmentalists believed that traditional light bulbs caused global warming."" But we're fact-checking the earlier version from AmeriPAC because it was widely circulated and spread even further via chain e-mail. The claim that next year, ""you will be mandated by federal law to get rid of your existing light bulbs,"" has no basis in fact. It amounts to a manufactured, baseless charge.",false,"National, Energy, Regulation, Chain email, "
803,8972,"Innovative triple pill significantly lowers blood pressure, study finds","August 15, 2018","This news release does a nice job of explaining the basic design of a study investigating whether a once-daily “triple pill” (that combines 3 different blood pressure-lowering medications) is more effective in lowering blood pressure than doctors’ usual approach. But there’s plenty of room for improvement here including: presenting the findings in a more meaningful context for patients, including the substantial adverse outcomes noted by the researchers, and using much more toned down language for results that are neither novel or all that significant. Notably, there is a significant financial conflict of interest involving the authors. This should have been made clear to readers. The global importance of poorly controlled high blood pressure is well-stated by the authors in the introduction to their study published in JAMA (paraphrased): High blood pressure is the leading cause of mortality and cardiovascular disease globally with most of the disease burden occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The availability and affordability of medications is a critical issue. About one-third of individuals with high blood pressure in these settings receive treatment. Only about half of patients treated in high-income countries and about 1-in-4 patients in low- and middle-income countries achieve blood pressure control. A fixed low-dose combination therapy with inexpensive blood pressure-lowering drugs has the potential to address several barriers to improve blood pressure control worldwide. Indeed, there’s significant need for a simple-to-take, effective, and affordable medication to address this issue. If successful, the benefits to patients, and the profits for developers, would be massive.","Michael Joyce, MD,Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Kathlyn Stone","The cost of the three-in-one pill is not mentioned. Two similar pills already on the market (Tribenzor and Exforge HCT). They’re also once-daily pills combining an angiotensin II receptor blocker + calcium channel blocker + thiazide diuretic. They both have a retail price of approximately $10 a pill, or $300 per month [Source: Drugs.com]. The target blood pressure (BP) for this study was below 140/90 (or below 130/80 in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease). The news release states that: “70% (of subjects) reached blood pressure targets with the ‘Triple Pill’, compared to just over half receiving normal care.” (Normal or usual care is defined in the release as “their doctor’s choice of blood pressure lowering medication.”) It should have been made more clear this was measured after 6 months in the study. And as a result, the effect on cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction of the combination is unknown. One of the goals of the approach using reduced dosage is to reduce the likelihood of side effects, but the side  effects reported in the study were not mentioned in the news release, and include: Overall, 419 adverse events in 255 patients (about 38% for the triple pill and 35% for usual care) Of note, both groups experienced similar rates of musculoskeletal pain (roughly 7%), but the triple pill group had much more dizziness and fainting (5.2% vs. 2.8%) as well. It should have been mentioned that combination antihypertensive (blood pressure lowering) medications are well known to have dozens of “major” drug interactions, and can also cause swelling and metabolic disturbances. We were glad to see that the basic study design was included: 700 patients randomized to either receive the triple pill or usual care, with an average patient age of 56 years old, and a mean baseline blood pressure of 154/90. This qualifies as “mild” hypertension. But it should have been made clear that while reduced blood pressure is a goal it is a surrogate goal. The real target of blood pressure reduction is reduced cardiovascular (CV) event rates. As we learned from previous research (ALLHAT trial), drugs that reduce blood pressure equally are not all created equally with regard to CV risk reduction. A finding that should have been included in the news release is that — after 6 months of treatment — the triple pill group achieved a mean BP = 125/76 vs. the usual care a mean BP = 134/81. That’s clinically relevant for two reasons. First, it clearly shows the difference in systolic blood pressure achieved by the triple pill group compared to the usual care group is only 9 mm of mercury. Not very clinically significant at the individual level, and arguably a modest achievement at the population level. Finally, it would have been useful to note, as the authors noted in the study, that since the research was conducted in Sri Lanka, with its unique health system and culture, the results may not be generalized to Western, industrialized countries. There is no disease-mongering here and a target blood pressure of <140/90 would be considered appropriate by many medical societies. It provides some context in terms of goals to reduce high blood pressure globally. Although this is mentioned … The study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia … what’s not mentioned is that the two lead authors quoted in the news release both receive a salary from George Health Enterprises (GHE is the product commercialization arm of The George Institute for Global Health). According to disclosures cited in the published study: George Health Enterprises has received investment funds to develop fixed-dose combination products containing aspirin, statin, and blood pressure-lowering drugs and has submitted a patent for the treatment of hypertension The news release calls the pill “innovative” and says it “could transform the way blood pressure is treated around the world” … but it fails to mention that combination blood pressure-lowering medications have been around for decades. And, as mentioned above, there are some once-daily “triple pills” already on the market. It’s implied (but not made very clear for readers) that the pill is in trials and, therefore, not commercially available. Despite the fact that other combination blood pressure-lowering medications are available (but not mentioned), the headline and first paragraph of this news release suggest novelty. That’s potentially misleading for readers. An editorial accompanying the study put this research in context in terms of what has been learned previously: The TRIUMPH investigators have demonstrated the effects of a promising intervention in a triple half-dose combination therapy, which logically extends findings from prior research to improve BP control among patients with mild to moderate hypertension. This study contributes to the existing literature demonstrating the essential role of fixed-dose combination therapy as a viable strategy for BP control on a global scale. This framing is premature, not supported by the study, and therefore unjustified: Could transform the way high blood pressure is treated around the world … expected the findings will change guidelines globally … a major advance.",false,"George Institute for Global Health,High blood pressure"

""And when it comes to COVID-19, after months of doing nothing, other than predicting the virus would disappear, or maybe if you drank bleach you may be okay, Trump has simply given up,"" said Biden, who delivered his remarks at a metalworks factory near his hometown of Scranton on Thursday. Trump spoke about the role he thought disinfectants could play in tackling an infection caused by the virus during a now infamous April 23 briefing. But he didn’t say people should drink bleach. His comments came after William Bryan, the undersecretary for science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, presented a study that found sun exposure and cleaning agents like bleach can kill the virus when it lingers on surfaces. Trump remarked on the effectiveness of those methods and wondered if they could help address infections in the human body. Here are his full comments: ""A question that probably some of you are thinking of if you’re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposedly we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. (To Bryan) And I think you said you’re going to test that, too. Sounds interesting, right?"" He continued. ""And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that, so that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we’ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That’s pretty powerful."" Later, Trump clarified his comments after a reporter asked Bryan whether disinfectants could actually be injected into COVID-19 patients. ""It wouldn’t be through injections, almost a cleaning and sterilization of an area. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t work, but it certainly has a big effect if it’s on a stationary object."" Trump did not explicitly recommend ingesting a disinfectant like bleach. Nevertheless, his remarks led some companies and state agencies to issue warnings about ingesting disinfectants.

At that time, internet users were circulating a bit of text tying Moderna to infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Hungarian-born financier George Soros, and American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, figures who previously had all been the subjects of various baseless conspiracy theories. The text linking Moderna with all of these public figures and implying they were involved in some nebulous but nefarious plot appeared to have been a completely tongue-in-cheek spoof of groundless conspiracy theories, but many readers who skimmed it at least wondered if it might have at least some substance to it:  The vaccine that is coming… As many of you heard Moderna is in stage 3 of their vaccine testing.

Moderna was a pharmaceutical company that started in Germany under the name IG Farben. IG Farben is infamous for it’s mass production of Zyklon-B, the primary gas used to kill millions during the Holocaust.

These are the symptoms for the common cold, but they don’t rule out Covid-19. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose. Some Covid-19 patients do get pneumonia, and one of the symptoms is a dry cough. A runny nose doesn’t rule out Covid-19. The new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun. There’s no evidence for this. There’s evidence that similar viruses transmit less well in the heat, but many countries with reported Covid-19 cases are experiencing temperatures higher than this. If someone with the new coronavirus sneezes, it travels about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. Environmental factors impact how far droplets from a sneeze can travel, but it is likely to be several metres. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap. It’s not yet known exactly how long the virus survives on surfaces. It can survive for 6-12 hours on fabric and will be killed by normal laundry detergent . There’s no evidence the virus can survive in clothing and be transmitted this way. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice. There’s no evidence that the temperature of liquids consumed can protect you from viruses. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes.

There’s no evidence this will prevent or cure the virus. Covid-19 starts with a sore throat lasting 3-4 days. It then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and the lungs, causing pneumonia, which takes about 5 or 6 days. With pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty breathing. The nasal congestion makes you feel like you’re drowning. This is a roughly accurate description of the most common symptoms, although not everyone with Covid-19 gets pneumonia.

Although allegations has been leveled by critics that their presence encourages migrants to make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing and Italian authorities have at least twice investigated accusations of illegal activities, no concrete proof has appeared. Organizations like Frontex and the United Nations stress that the non-governmental organizations’ role in saving lives is crucial.",Bethania Palma,"In mid-July 2017, a group of young adults from Europe and North America chartered a boat and set out on a mission (named “Defend Europe”) in which their stated goal was to block migrants making the dangerous sea crossing from Libya to Italy into Europe. Their plan involved blocking rescue ships operated by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working to prevent those migrants from drowning. Defend Europe’s pretext is their claim that the charities are profiting off illicit human smuggling or trafficking, which has become endemic in the migratory route. For example, Martin Sellner, a representative from the group, told Reuters at the Sicilian port city of Catania on 21 July 2017: There is a difference between saving lives and smuggling people to Europe. What they are doing in fact is making millions of dollars for human trafficking rings. We have found absolutely no evidence to suggest the NGOs involved in search and rescue in the Mediterranean are enriching themselves with smuggling, although this is a popular conspiracy theory among anti-immigrant groups angry at the high number of people making the journey into Europe. Defend Europe did not respond to questions we sent them asking for proof of their accusation, but they appear to be conflating the fact that while smugglers are involved in putting people on dangerous vessels and sending them out to sea, NGOs are rescuing migrants from these conditions, not profiting from them. Although the NGOs have been accused of creating a “pull”, or at least a link in transit for stranded migrants headed to Europe, they have not ever been officially accused of criminal smuggling or trafficking. There are eight NGOs operating rescue ships on the Mediterranean, including Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders, known best by the French acronym MSF); SOS Méditerranée (France); Save the Children; Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) (Malta); Proactiva Open Arms (Spain); and the German groups Sea-Watch, Sea-Eye and Jugend Rettet. Izabella Cooper, spokeswoman for the European Union border management agency Frontex, told us in an e-mailed statement: I would like to make it very clear that Frontex has never accused the NGOs of collusion. Saving lives is an international obligation for all those who operate at sea. The smugglers operating in Libya are taking advantage of this. Frontex has noted an important change in the way the smugglers operating in Libya run their dirty business since 2014: (1) The Search and rescue area has changed in the past: while in 2011 the boats were arriving all the way to Lampedusa, in 2014 the SAR area was half way between Italy and Libya, in 2016 and 2017 SAR area moved to the limit of the Libyan territorial waters. (2) The number of people travelling on board of the dinghies has increased: While in 2014 smugglers put on average 90 persons on board of a 10-meter-long dinghies, in 2016 and in 2017 we see as many as 170 travelling on boats of the same size. (3) The quality of the materials from which the boats are made has dramatically worsened in the past 2 years — the rubber is thinner and the boats made of one chamber now (used to be thicker and made of multiple chambers). (4) While in 2014 the quantity of fuel was sufficient for the boats to make longer journeys, now the fuel is only sufficient for the boats to leave the Libyan territorial waters. The same is valid for the drinking water and food. (5) Furthermore, recently we have also noticed that the smugglers remove the engines from the boats when they see a rescue boat nearby leaving the boat full of people adrift and in danger, in order to re-use the engine for another trip. The Italian coast guard on 2 August 2017 seized the Iuventa, a ship operated by the German NGO Jugend Rettet, on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration, and accused the crew of having contact with smugglers. However, Italian authorities stopped short of saying the NGO had colluded with smugglers for financial benefit, saying they believe the motivation was “exclusively humanitarian”. A previous investigation concluded in May 2017 by Catania’s chief prosecutor Carmelo Zuccaro also found no evidence that the humanitarian groups were or are receiving illicit money from smugglers. The Defend Europe group, which is part of the white nationalist “Identitarian” movement, crowdfunded nearly USD$200,000 by way of notorious Internet troll Chuck C. Johnson’s web site WeSearchr to hire a Mongolian-flagged boat called the C-Star to carry out their mission — although it’s unclear what they are doing. According to media reports, they had been detained at least twice, once by authorities at the Suez Canal and again in Cyprus, where they lost five Sri Lankan members of the ship’s crew who disembarked and then immediately applied for asylum. Meanwhile, Enzo Bianco, mayor of Catania, has asked authorities to block the ship from docking in that city’s port because he feared their presence would further inflame an already tense situation. Defend Europe did not respond to our questions, which included a query about their current location and where they planned to travel, but posted videos in several European languages of themselves aboard the boat on 3 August 2017. Of all the routes that migrants cross globally, the Mediterranean via Libya is by far the deadliest. Yet hundreds of thousands are making that journey to Europe and are expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. They come from a mixture of mainly Middle Eastern and African countries for a variety of reasons, according to a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees report; some flee violence or conflict from war-torn places like Syria to seek asylum, while others are looking for better economic prospects. Others still are victims of human trafficking or environmental crises that drive them from their home regions. The instability and general lawlessness in Libya that currently prevails creates fertile ground for human smugglers, who pack people onto increasingly dangerous vessels. As many as 950 people are believed to have died in 2015 when one such vessel capsized. NGOs took on a high profile role in pulling people to safety after the Italian navy shuttered a short-lived but successful rescue operation known as “Mare Nostrum” (“Our Sea” in Latin) that ran from October 2013 to October 2014, but was cut due to lack of support from other European Union countries. Mare Nostrum was initially launched in response to public outcry over a shipwreck that killed more than 300 people near the Italian island of Lampedusa in 2013. When that program ended, aid agency MSF — a 45-year-old NGO that brings doctors and medical personnel to crisis areas — took up the mission along with Frontex, which provided search and rescue resources (but at a fraction of the budget of Mare Nostrum). Other aid groups also joined in. MSF spokeswoman Sandra Murillo told us: MSF currently has two boats actively searching for boats in distress in international waters north of Libya: MV Aquarius run in in partnership with SOS MEDITERRANEE, and Prudence. MSF medical teams onboard treat violence-related injuries linked to detention, torture and other ill-treatment, including sexual violence, that people experienced in Libya. Medics treat skin diseases, dehydration, hypothermia, scabies and serious injuries such as chemical burns caused by fuel mixing with sea water in the boats. Pregnant women are cared for by midwives onboard and several babies have been born safely at sea. Lifesaving emergency care is also provided in emergency rooms on the boats or through medical evacuations, when needed. In the first six months of 2017, NGOs have completed 35 percent of the total of rescue operations in the Central Mediterranean. MSF alone has rescued and brought to safety more than 16,000 people. As of the end of July, just over 100,000 people have arrived on European shores in 2017, 94,802 of them in Italy. In the same timeframe, 2,385 people died while making the journey, according to the International Organization for Migrants. In the most recent reported tragedy, a boat carrying two women and five children capsized off the Turkish coast, killing all aboard.",false,"Uncategorized, alt-right, defend europe, europe"
809,9222,Immunotherapy shows promise in preventing leukemia relapse,"December 13, 2016","This release about a small trial of immunotherapy applied to a dozen leukemia patients who are at unusually high risk of relapse leaps to premature interpretations and inflates the meaning of the results far beyond the limited guidance for future research that this sort of study can offer. It inappropriately elevates the importance of relapse rates, implying that they predict vital outcomes, such as survival or quality life improvements, which this trial did not measure. Even as it puffs up the potential benefits, the release neglects to note either the short-term harms reported by researchers in their scientific conference abstract or the potential life-threatening harms that immunotherapy may expose patients to. The release doesn’t provide context for how these trial results relate to  existing or other experimental treatments, and it makes makes only an oblique reference to the personal financial stakes of a lead researcher. It does not make any reference to cost, even though recently-approved immunotherapy treatments suggest the price tag could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. On the positive side, the release does a good job of explaining why adjuvant treatment to enhance the immune system after bone marrow transplant may be necessary in certain leukemia patients. Relapse rates may reveal important clues to how long patients may live or how they will feel, but then again they may not. Any surmised connection between this sort of intermediate endpoint and the things that really mean something to patients must be tested. Until survival or quality of life trials are performed, news releases should not imply that an intermediate endpoint result, such as relapse rate, predicts better or longer life for patients.","Andrew Holtz, MPH,Susan Wei, PhD,Kathlyn Stone","Although this research in still in early stages, the release could have noted that immunotherapy can be very expensive. Some courses of treatment cost $100,000, while others need to be given continually at a cost that can exceed $10,000/month. The release reports that all 12 participants in the trial (those who received the T-cell therapy after a transplant) remained in remission during a median follow-up period of more than two years, while more than a quarter of transplant-only patients relapsed within 10 months. Although that seems like clear quantification of benefits, there are many examples of cancer treatments that have produced higher remission rates, but ultimately failed to help patients live longer or better. To be clear, we have no problem with the release reporting on the surrogate outcome, which may be the only measure available to estimate the treatment’s effects in these patients. However, we believe that the release should have cautioned that the remission rates do not necessarily predict survival or even quality of life…and that these factors, the ones that really matter to patients, will be measured only in future experiments. Not only does the release omit side effects or other potential harms from this type of treatment, it emphasizes the harms of conventional treatment, thus presenting an unbalanced comparison. The conference abstract summarizing the research noted that adverse events included short-term flu-like symptoms that are common to certain types of immunotherapy, as well as temporary reductions in white blood cell counts. In addition to failing to mention these reported harms, the release did not alert readers to potential life-threatening risks of immunotherapy which sometimes do not become apparent until the therapies have been given to many people over many years. Of note: a similar experimental immunotherapy trial by the same company (with acute lymphoblastic leukemia rather than AML patients) was halted after some patients died, according to this conference recap. The growing awareness of potential hazards of immunotherapy was recently highlighted in this post on HealthNewsReview.org. The release should have mentioned that the absence of life-threatening complications in this small trial does not prove the treatment is safe. The release reports that the trial involved only 12 patients and that the comparison group was made up of “similar” patients. But it does not explain that this comparison is not as clear-cut as a trial that randomizes patients to different treatments. Also, there is no mention of the amount or type of study that remains to be done. The release notes that the trial involved only acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients considered at high risk of relapse. It gives readers a sense that these patients are not typical of patients with AML. The release would have been better if it had provided some sense of the proportion of AML patients who fit the description of those in this trial. The release reports that funding came from the National Institutes of Health and from Juno Therapeutics. It says that one of the researchers is “a scientific co-founder” of Juno Therapeutics. So we will give the release a passing grade on this criterion. However, readers have to have sharp eyes to intuit that this disclosure means that the researcher owns part of the company and so stands to profit from any treatments that result from this work. Without any information on the extent of the type of leukemia relapse risk that is the target of this research or any evidence that a reduction in relapse rates ultimately gives patients longer or better quality life, there is no way to make an informed comparison with existing treatments. Nevertheless, the release makes unsupported assertions that this treatment appears to be superior to conventional treatment. The release also leaves out any mention of similar experimental therapies. The release reports that this is the first test of this particular treatment, so it is clear that it is just at the beginning of the research process. The release does not discuss similar experiments, including one that was outlined in the conference abstract, so readers cannot get a sense of how this experiment fits into a broad view of efforts to improve treatment of AML. The release doesn’t rely on sensationalism to describe the findings. However, researchers are quoted as saying the experimental treatment “might actually be helping patients who have a high risk of relapsing to not relapse down the line.” Then again, the reverse may be true and it might not be. While leukemia relapse is unwelcome, it cannot be known from this trial whether lower relapse rates mean longer or better lives for patients. Highlighting this sort of intermediate (or surrogate) endpoint distracts attention from the things that really matter to patients: the length and quality of their lives.",false,"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,leukemia,T-cell therapy"
810,27489,Mexican troops provided aid to U.S. residents in the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.,"September 5, 2016","The Mexican government takes this opportunity to express its full solidarity with the people and government of the United States as a result of the damages caused by Hurricane Harvey in Texas, and expresses that it has offered to provide help and cooperation to the US government in order to deal with the impact of this natural disaster — as good neighbors should always do in trying times.",Kim LaCapria,"In early September 2016, the confluence of Hurricane Hermine and a viral comment made by a televised Donald Trump supporter (about how taco trucks would be appearing on every corner in the U.S. should Trump lose the presidential election) revived interest in Mexico’s September 2005 response to Hurricane Katrina:   On 30 August 2016, the Facebook page for Mic. published a video reporting that Mexico’s purported response to Hurricane Katrina was “an encouraging moment which counteracts” the notion the country is “constantly in need,” adding that when Mexico sends its people across our border “history shows they’ve sent their best and bravest”:  Hurricane Katrina marked the costliest natural disaster in American history and the third most deadly, claiming at least 1,800 lives after the failure of levees caused catastrophic flooding in some of New Orleans’ most populous areas. Katrina was both newsworthy and culturally significant, inspiring multiple television documentaries and programs as well as rumors that continue to circulate years after the fact. The latter circumstance was likely due to the chaos that ensued after Katrina, as myriad accounts surfaced well after the floodwaters receded and the news media had moved on to other stories. Mic.‘s assertion that Mexico sent troops across the American border to assist what was by most accounts a stilted federal response to the tragedy was news to many social media users when it cropped up again in August 2016. Mexico’s response to Hurricane Katrina was well-documented at the time, but rarely included in retrospectives and long-form accounts of the storm and its aftermath, leading many social media users to question whether the claim was truly accurate. In July 2015, the Associated Press published archival footage of Mexican soldiers providing aid in Biloxi:  In a scene that would have given Donald Trump heart palpitations, 200 flag-waving Mexican troops breached the U.S. border outside Laredo, Tex., 10 years ago and advanced unopposed up Interstate 35 to San Antonio. It was the first time a Mexican army had marched on San Antonio since 1836 when Gen. Santa Ana massacred besieged Texas independence fighters at the Alamo. This time, however, the Mexican soldiers were on a relief mission to feed tens of thousands of homeless and hungry Americans displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Setting up camp at a former Air Force base outside San Antonio, they distributed potable water, medical supplies and 7,000 hot meals a day for the next three weeks. If this doesn’t sound like the Mexico you’ve been hearing about lately — the one that has been ripping America off, the one that sends rapists and criminals across the border — you might want to consider this little-known gesture of humanity from our abused southern neighbor as you think about Katrina 10 years later. I was serving as the No. 2 at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City in August 2005 when Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast. The storm’s track posed no danger to Mexico, and we followed events like most expatriate Americans — aghast, but at a distance. But not Mexicans. They were watching the same scenes of floating corpses and botched relief efforts in New Orleans. My chief contact at Mexico’s Foreign Ministry called to say the Mexican army had two field kitchens that could feed storm victims who had made their way to Texas, he said, and the navy had two ships that could help with cleanup efforts in New Orleans. To put this in context, the United States likes to think of itself as the country that does the helping, as we had done when Mexico City was struck by a devastating earthquake in 1985. But few had contemplated the possibility that Mexico would be coming to help us … The 45-vehicle convoy crossed the border at Laredo at dawn on Sept. 8 and arrived in San Antonio later that day. The only glitch was that the USDA would not allow the Mexicans to serve the beef they had brought because they couldn’t prove it had been produced in a mad-cow-free facility. Undeterred — and un-insulted — the Mexicans bought their beef locally. By the time their mission in San Antonio ended Sept. 25, the Mexicans had served 170,000 meals, helped distribute more than 184,000 tons of supplies and conducted more than 500 medical consultations. Disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, or the spectacle of U.S. presidential politics, often force to the surface the true character of the players. The Mexicans proved they were neighbors we can count on. A few traces of the years-old news story remained online as of 2017: A Mexican army convoy rolled into the United States with food, water and medicine for Hurricane Katrina victims, the first Mexican military operation on U.S. soil in 90 years. Part of an aid package that includes ships and rescue teams, the convoy of 45 olive-green vehicles and some 200 troops went over the Rio Grande into Texas from the city of Nuevo Laredo, witnesses said … The Mexican army trucks, filled with of thousands of ready-to-eat meals, drinking water and medical equipment, were searched like regular vehicles as they crossed the border early on Thursday headed for San Antonio, Texas customs officials said. Although Mexico’s response to Katrina was often overlooked in historical accounts of the disaster, the accounts are completely true. Mexican troops crossed the border in a 45-vehicle convoy on 8 September 2005, providing material and physical aid to several areas of the Gulf Coast devastated by Katrina; the Mexican army offered hundreds of thousands of meals and tons of supplies to those in need and performed hundreds of medical consultations during a time when the United States was struggling to provide aid to its own citizens in devastated areas.

811,38277," Warnings about Powassan Virus, a virus transmitted by ticks that can be deadly or cause permanent neurological symptoms, circulated as summer of 2017 began. ","June 1, 2017",Warnings About Tick-Transmitted Powassan Virus,  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"Powassan Virus is a real and potentially deadly transmitted virus that has affected about 75 people in the Northeast and Great Lakes region of America over a 10-year period, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports. As the number of cases reported over a 10-year period indicate, Powassan Virus has been fairly uncommon. Warnings about an increased risk for the virus were based solely on increases in the number of ticks in the Northeast, and in an uptick in the number of confirmed cases of the virus in deer. Warnings about Powassan Virus, or POW, spread across social media after CNN reported in May 2017 that the number of white-footed ticks in Maine in recent years had sparked some concerns about the virus, which is deadly in about 10% of reported cases. Dr. Jennifer Lyons, chief of the Division of Neurological Infections and Inflammatory Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, warned that an increase in Powassan Cases among deer could mean the same is imminent for humans: Scientists also believe Powassan is on the rise based on studies that have identified an increasing number of infections in deer. “So it does seem that there are more and more deer that they’re finding that have been infected with this virus,” Lyons said. “So we should expect it to increase in human disease incidence over the next few years.” By June 1st, Maine public health officials had confirmed two new cases of Powassan Virus, further fueling concerns that it could be spreading. The Maine Medical Research Institute also issued a report that found Powassan Virus was prevalent in the southern portion of the state. There aren’t any known vaccines or treatments for Powassan Virus. Symptoms usually emerge anywhere from a week to a month after being bitten by an infected tick. Some people might not experience any symptoms. Others might experience headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, loss of coordination, speech difficulties and seizures, CDC reports. About half of people with Powassan Virus have permanent neurological symptoms like memory loss, recurring headaches and muscle wasting. About 10% of Powassan Virus cases are fatal. To help avoid contracting POW, CDC suggests avoiding exposure to natural tick habitats, using over-the-counter repellants when you are in these areas, and removing ticks before they have a chance to bite.

813,15240,The U.S. has now spent more on reconstructing Afghanistan than was spent on the Marshall Plan and the reconstruction of Europe.,"August 20, 2015","Wuerker said that the United States has spent more for Afghanistan reconstruction than it did to rebuild Europe under the Marshall Plan. While the math behind the claim adds up, it's important to know that the reconstruction programs are not identical. The Marshall Plan spent no funds on military projects, while about 60 percent of Afghanistan aid was spent on security. The Marshall Plan was entirely focused on economic investments, while the spending in Afghanistan has been weighted much more toward establishing a secure space in which economic growth can occur. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",Jon Greenberg,"The days of a massive American military presence in Afghanistan are over. Afghan forces might benefit from about 10,000 U.S. trainers and advisers, but otherwise, the country’s security is in their hands. Yet after more than a dozen years of American engagement, the situation is fragile in the extreme. Talks between the government of President Ashraf Ghani and the Taliban are on hold with no date to restart. Military casualties are up 50 percent from last year. Nearly 5,000 civilians have died so far in 2015. In this context, Politico cartoonist Matt Wuerker offered his take on the results of billions of American taxpayer dollars invested in rebuilding the country. In an Aug. 4, 2015, cartoon, a bewildered Uncle Sam stands on top of a pipeline of aid to Afghanistan riven with cracks that spell the word ""corruption."" Superimposed is a box that says, ""The U.S. has now spent more on reconstructing Afghanistan than was spent on the Marshall Plan and the reconstruction of Europe."" A reader asked us to verify that comparison. In terms of inflation-adjusted dollars, the statement holds up. But, as we’ll explain, it falls short on two points. The primary source of the claim Wuerker pointed us to one of many news reports during 2014. In June that year, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction released one of its regular updates for Congress. In a short section, it compared the two programs. ""Adjusted for inflation, U.S. appropriations for the reconstruction of Afghanistan exceed the funds committed to the Marshall Plan, the U.S. aid program that delivered billions of dollars between 1948 and 1952 to help 16 European countries recover in the aftermath of World War II,"" the report said. The Inspector General analysts wrote that in inflation-adjusted dollars, the United States had spent $103 billion on the Marshall Plan and $109 billion on Afghanistan. The investment of American dollars is a fair yardstick, but experts noted others. Two very different programs While both efforts aimed to rebuild war-torn nations, the most striking difference is the Marshall Plan spent no money on the European armed forces. In contrast, about 60 percent of the aid spent on Afghanistan went towards arming and training the military and police. In fact, the Inspector General’s report makes note of that distinction. By its tally, building the Afghan security forces absorbed nearly $62 billion of the total. (To clarify, the total for Afghanistan excludes the cost of American military operations.) The Marshall Plan unfolded long ago, so a short summary is in order for those who might not know it well. The Truman administration and Congress created the Marshall Plan to stabilize the economies of Western Europe. In the early part, the program delivered hard goods such as food, animal feed, fertilizer and fuel. Later, direct aid shifted to providing raw materials and production equipment. Aid also came in the form of grants and loans. In the dollars of the time, spending reached $10.3 billion. About half was invested in power plants, roads, railroads and agriculture. Another portion went towards debt relief. There were loan guarantees to spur American firms to invest in Europe. Charles Maier, a Harvard historian, is a leading authority on post-World War II Europe. Maier told us that making comparisons across a span of more than 50 years is ""notoriously tricky."" The circumstances on the ground in Europe in the later 1940s and Afghanistan today are fundamentally different, Maier said. ""The European countries — outside Greece — were really functioning administrative systems,"" Maier said. ""Few of those societal infrastructures have been operative in Afghanistan. Also, when the aid was being provided, there was no fighting in the recipient countries, except for the civil war in Greece, 1946-49."" Maier also emphasized that while the inflation-adjusted dollars might put the Afghanistan price tag above that of the Marshall Plan, when compared to the size of the American economy at the time, the Marshall Plan represented a much heftier commitment than U.S. aid to Afghanistan. U.S. GDP then and now During the years of the Marshall Plan, the size of the U.S. economy was in the neighborhood of $310 billion (in dollars at that time). So, with total spending of $10.3 billion on European reconstruction, the Marshall Plan represented about 4.3 percent of average GDP. Maier then contrasted that with the Afghanistan spending between 2002 and 2014. During those years, the economy averaged about $14.3 trillion. The money spent on Afghanistan represented about 0.75 percent of average GDP. ""That's about one-twentieth of the Marshall Plan burden,"" Maier said. ""This seems a much more rational way of thinking about the burden the U.S. was bearing."" Seen through the lens of the strain on the American economy, the Marshall Plan required more effort than rebuilding Afghanistan. Our ruling Wuerker said that the United States has spent more for Afghanistan reconstruction than it did to rebuild Europe under the Marshall Plan. While the math behind the claim adds up, it's important to know that the reconstruction programs are not identical. The Marshall Plan spent no funds on military projects, while about 60 percent of Afghanistan aid was spent on security.

It has gone around the world several times and I have heard back from folks who know me all over the place. The purpose of the Eagle Eyes program is to familiarize military and civilian folks with the eight observable steps leading up to a terrorist event and to encourage them to call the phone numbers I provided to the FBI, Fresno Police or Air Force OSI if they see something that doesn’t look right. That way the appropriate agencies can intervene and stop an attack from taking place. Our program has been very effective and has been cited as the best in the Air Guard for two years in a row.

Rick Scott.","October 14, 2013",A mailpiece attempts to connect Foster’s rejected proposal for a fire readiness fee with Scott. This is junk mail.,Katie Sanders,"To political operatives, campaign mailers are often considered the most effective way to target voters, particularly in local elections. To fact-checkers, they’re often home to glaring distortions. Today’s example: A flier in the St. Petersburg mayor race that links incumbent Bill Foster, a $10 million fire fee and Republican Gov. Rick Scott. A headline on the mailer reads, ""Bill Foster's $10 million Rick Scott-inspired fire fee."" ""Foster’s $10 million fire fee would have charged you for services you already pay for. Sound familiar?"" the text continues. ""Instead of taking leadership by cutting fluff out of the budget, Bill Foster took a page out of Rick Scott’s Tallahassee playbook and tried to charge us millions of dollars in ‘fees’ that taxed you for services the government should have already been providing -- $10 million of them!"" The flier comes from Fact Check Florida, an electioneering communication organization, or ECO, that supports liberal candidates and is run by Jacksonville resident Matthew Martz. As an ECO, Fact Check Florida (nice name, by the way) can pay for ads that attack candidates, but it cannot expressly advocate for a candidate’s defeat or election. It can tell you why it thinks Foster is a bad guy but can’t tell you to vote for Foster’s opponent, Rick Kriseman. About the fire fee Yes, Foster pitched a fire readiness assessment, or ""fire fee"" in 2012 as a way to plug the city’s budget gap after another year of disappearing property tax revenues. But the idea was not ""inspired"" by Scott in any way. ""It was funny because it was from Fact Check Florida,"" Foster told us, ""and there was nothing factual about it."" In Foster’s first two years in office, the city made up for lost property tax revenues (a result of declining home values) by reducing positions and program spending. Foster criticized a potential fire fee as a ""backdoor tax increase"" in those years. But in 2012, he suggested that instead of more cuts, the City Council approve a new fire readiness fee that would total $9 million a year, which was about the amount needed to close its gap for 2013. The latest version of the proposal called for property owners to pay $50 a year per parcel and $.21 per $1,000 of its appraised structural value annually, according to Tampa Bay Times archives. Some council members criticized the fire fee as disproportionately punishing low-income residents by asking them to pay the same amount as wealthier residents. The council rejected the idea and instead raised the city’s property tax rate for the first time in two decades. Foster recently tried to distance himself from the fire fee that he was linked to so closely in news coverage. With Kriseman using it as an example of failed leadership, Foster told the Tampa Bay Times that he did not come up with the proposal, pointing to records that showed council members asked the idea to be considered at a workshop eight months before they ultimately rejected it. (This revelation came after the mailpiece was distributed, so we don’t hold it against the group for not including.) The connection to Scott Let’s go back to the ad. At its most generous reading, the ad implies Foster followed Scott’s lead of raising fees for existing services. But that does not align with Scott’s record in office, which has not seen major tax or fee increases beyond increases to tuition. The state also has cut taxes and fees for Floridians since Scott took office. You can read about that here. Fact Check Florida's Martz defended the mailer. While the fee was ""obviously"" not Scott’s idea, he said, it’s similar to Tallahassee Republicans who ""keep coming up with tiny ways to take money out of voters’ pockets without them noticing."" ""Under Rick Scott, it was with tuition rates,"" he said. ""And before he got there, the Republicans did it with driver’s license renewals and things."" Martz’s last point refers to $2.2 billion in increased taxes and fees that Republican lawmakers passed in 2009 -- before Scott became governor. The St. Petersburg mayor’s race is nonpartisan, but the injection of Scott highlights the political differences between the two candidates. Foster is a Republican who has Scott’s endorsement, while Kriseman is Democrat whose campaign is being partly financed by the Florida Democratic Party. Another third-party group led by Tallahassee lobbyist David Ramba is attacking Kriseman in a separate mailer for sharing partisan policies akin to the ones that brought about the government shutdown. The evolution was inevitable after the city voted in 1993 to move to a strong mayor system, argues Darryl Paulson, University of South Florida St. Petersburg professor emeritus of government. In the case of this ad, tying Foster with an unpopular governor appeals to the emotions of voters, Paulson said. ""The Democrats are in essence trying to say that even though it’s not a partisan race, look who is supporting Foster, and we as Democrats hate the governor,"" Paulson said. ""It’s really designed as a get out the vote effort to get Democratic voters to to vote in a nonpartisan election.""

819,9285,Study Suggests Breastfeeding May Lower Risk of Childhood Leukemia,"June 1, 2015","Do formula-fed children face increased risk of leukemia? This news release summarizes a published report on data from 18 separate studies worldwide that, when analyzed together, suggest breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of developing childhood or adolescent leukemia. But that’s basically the only message conveyed by the news release, which is otherwise devoid of important context, including — most importantly — on the limitations of the observational design used by all of studies in the analysis. The release’s incomplete, one-sided presentation will most likely lead to a flurry of overblown media coverage that could have negative repercussions for the many women who cannot or choose not to breastfeed. There are many reasons for women to think that breastfeeding is a good choice for their babies. Is leukemia prevention one of them? That’s the suggestion of the study reported on here, which is a re-analysis of previous studies examining the question. It’s worthwhile research, but let’s remember that these underlying studies all relied on a backward-looking case-control design that is subject to selection bias and a variety of other potential problems. And the scope of the potential benefit for this condition, which is thankfully quite rare, is limited. Our worry here is that women face a number of physical and lifestyle constraints that may affect their ability to breastfeed. And women who can’t breastfeed already experience guilt that they aren’t doing enough for their babies. Should they also be made to feel as if they are putting their children at increased risk of cancer? That’s not a justifiable message based on this study. But without more careful communication of study limitations and other context, we’re afraid that that’s the message that could ultimately reach the public.","Kathlyn Stone,Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Kevin Lomangino","While it’s obvious that breastfeeding is free of charge, readers might not appreciate what an advantage this is compared with prepared formulas. This is an especially important consideration in the developing world where a desire for westernization has caused a significant bump in infant formula sales. The average annual cost of a brand-name infant formula is approximately $1200 in the US. Then again, there’s potentially a cost to breastfeeding in terms of work/career advancement for the mother and the labor value of time spent breastfeeding/pumping. Breast pumps can be expensive, too. The news release didn’t need to explore all of this, but some acknowledgment of the issues at play would have been welcome. According to the release, this analysis of 18 studies found that “breastfeeding for six months or longer was associated with a 19 percent lower risk compared with no breastfeeding or breastfeeding for a shorter period of time.” A sub-analysis of 15 studies further showed that “ever being breastfeed” for a shorter period of time was associated with an 11 percent lower risk in developing leukemia compared to those who were never breastfed. But how big really is a “19% lower risk”? That depends upon whether leukemia is generally common or rare. A 19% reduction in a rare condition like childhood leukemia won’t amount to a very large absolute benefit. The release could have put a number on it. We’re on the fence here. We’re not suggesting that breastfeeding causes serious harm to mother or child, except perhaps in some cases of infectious disease transmission. However, breastfeeding isn’t always the peaceful scene of contentedly suckling infant often portrayed in the media. Cracked nipples, nipple pain, engorgement, mastitis (breast infections) are not uncommon and can reduce breastfeeding success. In addition, breast milk is low in vitamin D, and exclusive breastfeeding may increase the risk of rickets. Some acknowledgment of these issues could potentially encourage steps to prevent and address these problems, which would be beneficial. This was a meta-analysis of observational studies of breastfeeding and leukemia risk. As we’re often fond of saying, these types of studies are incapable of proving cause and effect. And yet the release is headlined, “Study Suggests Breastfeeding May Lower Risk of Childhood Leukemia” — the clear implication being that breastfeeding may have “caused” the reduction in leukemia. The release also fails to mention any weaknesses or limitations in the study design. This is important, because case-control studies sit near the bottom of the evidence pyramid and their findings should be viewed cautiously. And this study doesn’t control for confounding factors that could affect leukemia risk. The weaknesses that were cataloged in the original study (but not the release) include the following: the voluntary responses from mothers were collected in most of the studies years after the time of breast-feeding which might affect accurate recall; the response rates varied from 47 percent to 98 percent in the leukemia cases in a majority of the studies; and the response rates from controls were believed to be skewed toward a higher response rate from people with a higher socioeconomic status (which itself might be associated with lower rates of leukemia). Further, and perhaps most importantly, some studies didn’t define whether the breastfeeding was exclusive or if the babies were concurrently fed with formula or other foods. The news release also doesn’t define how many children were followed and for how long. This is an unfortunate oversight since the size, length and global nature of the study are its strong points. According to the research paper published in JAMA Pediatrics upon which the release is based, data from 10,292 leukemia cases and 17,517 controls were analyzed. Many of the studies followed children from 0 years to 14 years, some longer. The analysis includes 18 studies published over a 54-year period in 13 developed countries and five lesser developed countries. While the findings must still be viewed cautiously, the depth of data analyzed lends it more credence than research involving a small sample size and a brief time frame. The release states that “Leukemia is the most common childhood cancer and accounts for about 30 percent of all childhood cancers.”  And it suggests that breastfeeding can prevent these leukemias, which has the potential to make mothers feel badly if they’re unable to successfully breastfeed (a common phenomenon). But the release never provides the comforting information that cancer in children is, according to the National Cancer Institute, a “rare” disease. This is important context. Neither the news release nor the study cited any outside sponsors. The study was completed by epidemiologists at the School of Public Health in Haifa, Israel, and the Ministry of Health in Ramat Gan, Israel. Perhaps it goes without saying that the alternative to breast milk is infant formula, but the release could have stated this explicitly, which would have provided an opportunity to point out the other potential health advantages of breastmilk as well as the financial advantages. Not doing so provides a rather incomplete narrative. While it may be assumed that breastfeeding is available to all, this is an oversimplification. Many women have trouble initiating breastfeeding and may have jobs or other limitations that make it difficult to breastfeed. The public can be hostile to breastfeeding women. Some women do not produce enough milk to exclusively breastfeed their babies. Studies have found that while about 75% of women attempt to breastfeed in the first week, only about 30% are still exclusively breastfeeding by three months. Some acknowledgment of the difficulties involved would have provided an opportunity to mention programs and interventions, including postpartum skin-to-skin contact, partner education, lactation consultants, etc, that may improve breastfeeding success. The news release did not comment on the novelty of the research, and doesn’t tell us how this study differs from other meta-analyses of studies of breastfeeding and childhood leukemia. As the study authors claimed in the published report, “to our knowledge, this is significantly the largest and most up-to-date review and analysis of current knowledge on childhood leukemia and breastfeeding.” While the suggestion that breastfeeding reduces leukemia rates is questionable, we’ve already flagged the release for that concern. The release makes no other unwarranted claims and its tone is generally measured.",false,"breastfeeding,infant formula,JAMA,leukemia"

The headline was changed to: ""US hospitals should prepare for 96 million coronavirus infections and nearly half a million deaths, leaked documents reveal."" That is, ""are preparing"" was changed to ""should,"" but the leaked documents reference remained. Business Insider, a U.S.-based news website, also used ""leaked"" in the headline of its article, which requires a subscription to access. Business Insider reported that it obtained slides from a webinar on COVID-19, the disease caused by the current coronavirus, that was hosted by the American Hospital Association on Feb. 26, 2020. The article said one slide, presented by Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases expert and internal medicine professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. He is director of international programs and innovation at its Global Center for Health Security. Lawler, who has treated patients infected with the coronavirus who have been evacuated from China, estimated there could be as many 96 million coronavirus cases and 480,000 deaths in the United States. ""Overall, the slide points out that hospitals should prepare for an impact to the system that's 10 times a severe flu season,"" the Business Insider story says. The hospital association confirmed to Business Insider that the slides it reported on were authentic. It said that the information represented the views of the experts who participated, not the association. The association told us the same thing. It did not respond to our questions about whether hospitals are preparing for coronavirus in the numbers estimated by Lawler. No other American mainstream news media have reported on the estimates, according to a Nexis search. Though clearly, with such guidance, hospitals are preparing for a large outbreak. A separate March 7, 2020, story about Lawler’s estimates in another United Kingdom-based newspaper, The Independent, said Lawler ""advised hospitals to prepare"" for an outbreak of this size. That’s a different tone than is implied by the Daily Mail headline. ""I HOPE hospitals are preparing for this,"" Lawler told PolitiFact by email. ""Word is percolating through groundswell of professional networks as people hear ground truth from Italy, but I am afraid official sources for information are way behind."" The original post said, ""U.S. hospitals are preparing for 96 million coronavirus infections and nearly half a million deaths, leaked documents reveal."" One expert estimated at an American Hospital Association webinar that there could be 96 million coronavirus cases and 480,000 deaths in the United States. But these supposedly ""leaked"" documents were slides presented by one epidemiologist during a webinar to members of the American Hospital Association. They don’t represent some official attempt to conceal information, as the original Daily Mail headline, later changed, suggests. They also don’t provide evidence that hospitals are preparing for coronavirus cases in those numbers, though clearly this information is being used as guidance for hospitals’ preparations.

822,10581,"Prostate cancer blood test could transform treatment, say scientists","June 21, 2017","This story describes a potential advance in precision medicine. Certain cancer therapeutics target tumors that have specific characteristics, such as the so-called PARP inhibitors. A diagnostic test to see if those specific characteristic exist, such as the liquid biopsy test described here, could help select patients most likely to benefit. Unfortunately, this article is essentially a rewrite of the news release, glossing over the measured benefits, the costs, the harms–and much more. There are many details of this study that warrant critical examination. Readers won’t be well-served by this story that parrots the PR promotions.","Jill U. Adams,Andrae Vandross, MD,Joy Victory","The article did not mention costs. The story did not quantify the benefits of using the three-in-one liquid biopsy. Readers learned that results of the biopsy were used to initiate (or not) and continue (or not) treatment with a cancer therapeutic drug that targets certain types of prostate cancers in men. Readers did not learn anything about the trial design or how effectiveness of the biopsy was measured. At the very least, it would have been helpful to know what proportion of patients “benefited” (changing drug vs. initiating drug). The story made no mention of potential harms of the liquid biopsy itself or of guiding chemotherapeutic treatment decisions based on results of the liquid biopsy. What about false positives? And false negatives? Erroneous results from a “simple” blood test could lead to a patient stopping the drug prematurely or initiating erroneously. Stories about screening tests must include the false positive and false negative rates for these reasons–they are a real risk. The story does discuss the various ways the liquid biopsy might be helpful. Its descriptor — three-in-one — was explained for readers; its essentially a way to select patients that might benefit from targeted cancer therapy and to monitor response and resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug. But no study results were outlined, other than a brief mention that this was a phase 2 trial with about 49 men in the study. The article did not overhype the risks of prostate cancer. The story quotes two sources: 1) the first author, who’s a researcher at the UK’s Institute of Cancer Research; and 2) the Chief Executive of the very same research institution. No outside sources were mentioned, much less quoted. It was good that funding sources were mentioned, however. The article makes no mention about alternatives. It doesn’t make clear what current standard therapy is for prostate cancer or how patients are currently selected for treatment with the targeted cancer drug. It also didn’t discuss that the drug itself–olaparib–is still being researched for effectiveness. The story does not help readers understand whether this blood test is available now–or if not, when it might become available for wider, non-research use. The article makes clear that this is a new test for circulating DNA that provides specific information about a cancer patient’s individualized cancer profile. However, the only people to say so are the researchers testing the liquid biopsy. This claim would carry more weight if it came from an independent source. It appears that the story heavily relied on this news release from the UK’s Institute of Cancer Research. And without attribution. For example, this quote that appears in the news release appears verbatim in the news story:  “Our study identifies, for the first time, genetic changes that allow prostate cancer cells to become resistant to the precision medicine olaparib. “From these findings, we were able to develop a powerful, three-in-one test that could in future be used to help doctors select treatment, check whether it is working and monitor the cancer in the longer term. We think it could be used to make clinical decisions about whether a PARP inhibitor is working within as little as four to eight weeks of starting therapy. “Not only could the test have a major impact on treatment of prostate cancer, but it could also be adapted to open up the possibility of precision medicine to patients with other types of cancer as well.”",false,The Guardian
826,25802,Allen West Says the coronavirus has a “99.9% recovery rate” in Texas.,"August 10, 2020","The calculation behind West’s “recovery rate” is not accurate. He looked at people who did not die after contracting COVID-19 and compared that figure to the entire population, not just those individuals who have been infected. Experts said his definition of the recovery rate is also misleading, as it counts any person who did not die as having recovered. In reality, studies have shown lasting health impacts on those who contracted the virus but are no longer infectious.",Madlin Mekelburg,"Texas Republicans selected a new party leader at last month’s virtual state convention, overwhelmingly supporting retired Army Lt. Col. Allen West, a former one-term U.S. House member from Florida as chairman over incumbent James Dickey. West described some state-level actions aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus in the state as tyrannical during his address to delegates during the convention — a criticism that he has carried over to media appearances following his election. During an appearance on a North Texas radio program on July 27, West talked about the state’s coronavirus response and the recovery rate for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. ""When I look at a state like Texas, which has 29 million in population, we’re getting close to I guess about 300,000 or so COVID-19 positive cases — there’s some questions about what a positive case really means — and sadly we’ve lost about 3,900 Texans,"" West said. ""That’s only .01% of our population. If you just want to look at the facts, and I know everyone is concerned about this resurgence of COVID-19, but again we see more testing, more positive cases but yet the death rate is continuing to drop. I don’t want to see us get to the point where we’re imposing draconian measures, measures that go against our fundamental liberties and freedoms and rights over something that has a 99.9% recovery rate."" West described the same recovery rate during an interview with a television station in Dallas on Sunday, stating: ""99.9% of Texans are able to recover from COVID-19."" Is that accurate? West’s numbers for positive cases and deaths are outdated and his figure for the recovery rate is wrong. ""The statement that COVID-19 ""has a 99.9% recovery rate"" is something I would characterize as ,"" said Cory Zigler, an associate professor of statistics and data sciences and of women’s health at the University of Texas. Coronavirus figures in Texas At the time of West’s statement on July 27, Texas was reporting 385,923 positive COVID-19 test results from molecular tests and 5,713 fatalities connected to the coronavirus. The state has since corrected the number of fatalities for July 27 as 5,489. West said the numbers he used in his calculation were from mid-July. When asked about the formula he used to calculate his recovery rate — recoveries versus the state’s population — he said it was meant to show the impact of the virus in the state. ""I chose that comparative means because we would use the same methodology to assess any illness affects against the greater population,"" he said in a statement (which was later posted to the Texas Republican Party’s Facebook page). But that’s not true. Zigler said calculating the recovery rate would involve a count of the people who have been infected with COVID-19 and the count of those who recover — which in West’s definition is all those who did not die. The latest numbers would put that rate closer to 98.7% Comparing recoveries to the population at-large does not produce a recovery rate. ""You don’t recover from something you’ve never had,"" Zigler said. Diana Cervantes, director of the Master of Public Health Epidemiology Program at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth, agreed and said the calculation West used is ""poor math."" ""How can you say someone is recovered if they have never been infected?"" she said. Plus, Cervantes said West’s assertion that this methodology would be used to assess the impact of any illness is a stretch. ""The reason you collect data on diseases is because you have certain goals, including to understand the burden of the disease and whether control measures are effective,"" she said. ""One of those goals is usually not — because of limited resources — to say ‘what is the recovery rate’ and ‘how many people return to their normal state of health’."" ""That kind of question is usually beyond the scope of the resources of health departments and even academic institutions to answer that question,"" she said. Examining what recovery means Another component of West’s claim that needs a closer look is how he characterizes recoveries: all those who tested positive and did not die. Zigler and Cervantes said this is one way of describing recoveries, but another definition may be more common. ""One could imagine a different definition of ‘recovery’ to mean ‘did not die and no longer remains sick’ which would decrease the ‘recovery rate’ since there is evidence that many people have lasting problems after infection,"" Zigler said in an email. While research is ongoing, doctors and researchers have raised concerns about the lasting impact of COVID-19. Studies have found that ""recovered"" patients continued to have impaired organ function and blood test results did not return to normal after the individual was no longer infectious. The recovery rate has been a point of friction for some public officials, as different states use distinct formulas to calculate the rate. In Texas, the state produces an estimate based on hospitalizations and average stays. ""It is misleading and could be a little dangerous,"" Cervantes said, adding that people may be less cautious in their efforts to stop the spread of the virus if they think their chances of returning to their usual state of health after becoming infected are as high as 99.9%. ""It will give people a  impression that most people who get infected, we know that they are now back to their previous state of health and really, there is no way to know that,"" she said. ""We don’t know that unless we survey people and do a more in depth look into this thing, and we’re barely keeping up with contract tracing as it is."" Our ruling West gave outdated numbers for the numbers of infections and deaths in Texas. He also said the recovery rate for COVID-19 is 99.9%, based on the number of people in Texas who did not die after testing positive for COVID-19 divided by the entire population of Texas. Experts said West’s calculation here is wrong. Even if you defined all people who were infected with the virus and didn’t die as having recovered, that rate would be 98.7%. But that way of considering recovery would be misleading since studies have shown many people suffer long-term health effects from the virus.

827,29438,"Voters across Texas have witnessed their votes switch from ""straight Republican"" to Democrat on compromised voting machines.","October 25, 2016","What's true: A woman in Tarrant County claimed that her vote switched from Republican to Democrat and she caught and corrected the error; a subsequent investigation determined the machine was working properly, and the woman admitted she may have erroneously selected the wrong candidate. What's false: Reports are not flooding in from across Texas about vote switching, and most anecdotes are identical with localities changed.",Kim LaCapria,"On 25 October 2016, rumors spiked claiming Texas voters (in cities as far-flung as San Antonio, Odessa, Amarillo, and Houston) were witnessing voting machines swap out “straight Republican” line voting with votes for Hillary Clinton. The starting point of the rumor was not clear (many different Texas cities have been cited in otherwise identical versions of the rumor), but a number of inquiries mentioned the City of Arlington as the purportedly affected jurisdiction. We contacted Tarrant County and spoke with an elections official there who told us the rumor was not new, as every election brings along with it claims of “vote switching.” She stated that in all instances where machine or voting equipment malfunctions are reported, a technician physically investigates the machine involved in an attempt to replicate the error (adding that the county has never successfully managed to reproduce a switched vote). The representative stated that someone from the county spoke with the claimant on 24 October 2016 after the machine she had used was tested by a technician. The representative asked the woman whether it was possible she inadvertently hit “enter” using a scroll wheel, and the woman said she might have in fact accidentally selected the wrong candidates herself. But the machine the woman used was found to be properly calibrated and working correctly. San Antonio radio station KISS-FM reported that similar claims out of Potter and Randall County were investigated, and the purported “vote switching” was attributed to “human error”: Potter County Judge Nancy Tanner released a statement [on 25 October 2016]. It said, “There is nothing wrong with any of the machines we use for voting. They do not flip your vote. They do not flip parties. Humans do that.” It goes on to talk about the situation in Canyon: “There was one incident in Randall County where a voter voted straight ticket and when they hit the vote button, it flipped parties … The machine was then checked and nothing was wrong with the machine.” According to the Randall County Elections Office, they were aware of this mistake but addressed it as user-error. They said that there are several voters each year who report that their ballots are mismarked, but they are usually caused by the voter accidentally selecting a different party. We also contacted the Texas Secretary of State to ask about the geographically dispersed rumors, and the representative with whom we spoke stated that Texas comprises 254 different elections, all administrated at the county level. Machines and even voting methods (such as optical scan or wheel) vary from county to county, meaning that a particular form of vote “rigging” would be difficult or impossible to implement all across Texas. She explained that voting equipment used in that state had largely been obtained many years prior to the 2016 election, and that voting machines are not connected to the Internet. According to the Texas Secretary of State’s office, each vote is recorded in three places: on the machine itself, on an external drive, and on a paper printout. Citing the possibility of human error or (relatively rare) miscalibration of voting machines, the representative told us the office encouraged all voters to double check their ballots before submitting their vote. She added that should a voter encounter a malfunctioning piece of voting equipment, it is imperative they report the incident to election officials to ensure the issue can be addressed. However, she was not aware of any official reports of widespread or localized vote switching (despite the rampant rumors on Facebook). All three agencies we contacted affirmed that vote-switching rumors are in no way news to the 2016 general election, and that user error overwhelmingly accounts for reports of switched votes. The County of Chambers in Texas did temporary switch from voting machines to emergency paper ballots while awaiting a software upgrade to fix a problem with the former, but that issue affected both parties equally: On Monday, October 24, 2016, at the beginning of Early Voting it was brought to the attention of the County Clerk, Heather H. Hawthorne, that the Straight Party vote for both the Republicans and Democrats, did not automatically select one race on each ballot. The error was caused in programming by ES&S (Election Systems and Software Inc.), the vendor who programs the election software used in Chambers County. Immediately, Hawthorne contacted ES&S and advised them of the issue. Hawthorne then contacted the Secretary of State’s office, the office overseeing the elections in Texas, and was informed to create emergency paper ballots to be used until the problem could be fixed. ES&S, based in Dallas, informed Hawthorne they would send software to correct the issue. Today, Hawthorne will be in the polling locations to install the corrected software to the votronic machines. Hawthorne is confident that all machines should be ready by the end of today. However, that particular glitch did not appear to affect votes cast for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton: An error in the voting machine programming by Election Systems & Software (ES&S) caused votes for one statewide court of appeals race not to be entered when a voter tried to vote straight ticket in either party according to a release from Chambers County. As local news sources indicated, the malfunction in question did not involve “vote switching,” but rather the machines failure to record downballot votes for “straight ticket” voters. The machines were repaired on 25 and 26 October 2016, and the issue was immediately addressed by the Texas Secretary of State. A number of readers contacted us claiming that a cell video depicted the Texas “vote switching phenomenon”: Does anyone still believe that #VoterFraud doesn’t exist? Here we have a sample from early voting in Texas… https://t.co/8jmTt2S3hO — Logic Doesnt Lv Here (@LD_LH) October 26, 2016  Not that I’m trying to support these claims on voting machines switching votes, but there is a video that seems to show this. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=814936408608816&id=644891892279936 Explain this link. http://viralliberty.com/cell-phone-video-released-showing-vote-machines-changing-votes-democrat/.

828,39800,  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised young mothers to delay breastfeeding because studies show that it could make vaccines less effective for their babies.  ,"March 17, 2015",CDC Says Mothers Shouldn’t Breastfeed to Make Vaccines More Effective,  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"This claim is false. A number of blog sites have cited a 2010  study titled, “The Inhibitory Effect of Breast Milk on Inactivity of Live Oral Rotavirus Vaccines,” in making this claim. The study explored why vaccines are less effective among children in poor, developing countries than in middle income and industrialized countries. According to the study’s abstract: The lower immunogenicity and efficacy of rotavirus vaccines in poor developing countries could be explained, in part, by higher titers of IgA and neutralizing activity in breast milk consumed by their infants at the time of immunization that could effectively reduce the potency of the vaccine. Strategies to overcome this negative effect, such as delaying breastfeeding at the time of immunization, should be evaluated. Researchers from the CDC did participate in the study, as the eRumor claimed. But the study does not suggest that women in the U.S. should delay breastfeeding. It suggests that delayed breastfeeding “should be evaluated” in developing countries at the time of the child’s vaccination. In the U.S, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) working group  suggests that young mothers forgo immunizations — not breastfeeding — to avoid complications in their children: Precaution: A condition in a recipient that might increase the risk for a serious adverse reaction or that might compromise the ability of the vaccine to produce immunity. Under usual circumstances, vaccination should be deferred. However, vaccination might be indicated because benefits outweigh risks. In the context of pregnancy and breastfeeding, serious adverse reaction includes maternal, fetal or neonatal serious adverse events linked to the vaccine. Contraindication means that there is direct evidence or strong biologic plausibility and suggestive evidence that the risk of severe adverse event is elevated for at least one of these groups. Precaution means there is no supporting evidence but there is some biologic plausibility; precaution may also mean that there is a lack of data to support safety. For its part, the CDC  encourages that all young mothers breastfeed their babies and  works to increase breastfeeding rates. The CDC  reports: One of the most highly effective preventive measures a mother can take to protect the health of her infant is to breastfeed. However, in the United States, although most mothers hope to breastfeed, and 79% of babies start out being breastfed, only 19% are exclusively breastfed 6 months later. Additionally, rates are significantly lower for African-American infants. The success rate among mothers who want to breastfeed can be greatly improved through active support from their families, friends, communities, clinicians, health care leaders, employers, and policymakers. Given the importance of breastfeeding for the health and wellbeing of mothers and children, it is critical that we take action across the country to support breastfeeding. And “deferred breastfeeding” is a very small portion of global efforts to increase the effectiveness of vaccines in developing countries. One of the biggest hurdles is that vaccines must be kept cold to remain effective, yet children live in remote areas with limited access to electricity and refrigeration, so vaccines often spoil, the humanitarian group Deutsche Welle reports: Health workers have to keep vaccines cool at all times – from the moment of their production until they are administered by injection or in other ways. “This is one of the reasons why we’re still unable to vaccinate many children against diseases, which have been wiped out in developed countries – polio, for example,” says Sebastian Dietrich, a physician working with Doctors without Borders. “We just can’t get the vaccines to very remote areas while keeping them cool.” When Doctors Without Borders vaccinates people in developing countries, they face serious challenges, says Dietrich. Most sensitive vaccines solutions become unusable as soon as their temperature rises above eight degrees Celsius. Dietrich and his colleagues have to get the vaccines through customs before they go bad, and they have to find storage rooms with good refrigeration, or transport the vaccines by car to remote areas, where there may not even be electricity. Deutsche Welle concludes that developing nanovaccines that don’t need refrigeration is the key to increasing effectiveness — not delayed breastfeeding. Comments",false,9/11 Attack on America

Patients will receive treatment free of charge for the first two weeks, he added. Thailand, which has a tradition of using cannabis to relieve pain and fatigue, legalized marijuana for medical use and research in 2017 to boost agricultural income. There are already around 25 cannabis clinics attached to general hospitals around the country but, unlike the newly-launched pilot clinic, they operate for just a few days a week due to a lack of specialized staff. The largest producer of medicinal cannabis is currently the health ministry’s Government Pharmaceutical Organization. Kasetsart University’s director of medical cannabis research, Natakorn Thasnas, told Reuters that the university would supply  2,200 kilograms of cannabis leaf to the ministry. Cannabis production, cultivation and sale has been limited to licensed Thai producers for the next four years to protect the domestic industry. Currently, only hospitals and research facilities are allowed to apply for cannabis production and extraction licenses, but the government is reviewing regulations to enable Thai businesses to apply for permits. Last year, Thailand dropped cannabis and hemp extracts from its narcotics list and proposed a draft law that would allow each household to grow six cannabis plants. Four types of drugs, containing different combinations of cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psycho-active ingredient in cannabis, were given to patients to treat migraine, insomnia, neck pain and muscle stiffness, the ministry said in a statement. The pilot clinic, based in the Ministry of Public Health, expects to see between 200 to 300 patients daily. “I was worried at first, but I studied the effects and decided it was better because its natural,” said Waraporn Boonsri, 69, who received four vials of cannabis oil to help her sleep. Nearly 2,200 patients have registered at the clinic until March, a health official told Reuters.

837,24796,The House Democrats' so-called 'stimulus' has been stuffed with an astonishing $335 million to fund prevention programs of sexually transmitted diseases.,"January 29, 2009",STD spending is in the economic stimulus plan,Robert Farley,"Republicans have large philosophical differences with the $819 billion economic stimulus package that passed the House on Jan. 28, 2009, and they have tried to discredit the plan by singling out relatively small spending proposals they see as inappropriate. One of the most widely cited claims from Republican leaders has been that the stimulus plan includes millions for sexually transmitted disease education. On the day of the the House vote, the National Republican Congressional Committee circulated a news release in the districts of 29 freshman House Democrats, chastising them for supporting a massive spending plan that the NRCC said includes $335 million for sexually transmitted disease prevention programs. A version of the news release circulating in Florida, for example, begins, ""Rep. Alan Grayson (FL-08) and Rep. Suzanne Kosmas (FL-24) are set to cast their vote today on a so-called 'stimulus' package, which has shattered the trillion dollar mark. The question is: Will Alan Grayson and Suzanne Kosmas still support the massive spending bill now that it has become public that the House Democrats' so-called 'stimulus' has been stuffed with an astonishing $335 million to fund prevention programs of sexually transmitted diseases?"" Rep. Eric Cantor, the House Republican whip, had been making the same point for days, including in an interview with Fox News on Jan. 23. But the STD spending issue gained considerable momentum as a Republican attack after the Drudge Report posted an alert about it at the top of its popular political Web page on Jan. 28. So is there really STD prevention spending in the stimulus bill passed by House Democrats on Jan. 28? Yes, there is. In a section of the plan that includes funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the bill states that ""not less than $335,000,000 shall be used as an additional amount to carry out domestic HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually-transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis prevention programs, as jointly determined by the Secretary and the Director."" In an interview on CBS's  Early Show  on Jan. 29, the day after the House passed the stimulus package, anchor Maggie Rodriguez asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi how $335 million in STD prevention would stimulate the economy. Said Pelosi: ""I'll tell you how. ... I'm a big believer in prevention. And we have — there's a part of the bill, on the health side of it, that is about prevention. It's about it being less expensive to the states to do these prevention measures."" We note that while the NRCC news release specifically calls out House Democrats for the STD spending, the Senate version of the bill also includes it — in fact, slightly more. A portion of the stimulus plan approved by the Senate Appropriations committee on Jan. 27 states that ""not less than $400,000,000 shall be transferred to the CDC for an additional amount for the screening and prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV."" A committee report on the bill backs up the HIV and STD prevention spending with this analysis: ""CDC estimates that approximately 19 million new STD infections occur annually in the United States, with 1 in 4 teenage girls currently infected. This epidemic is estimated to cost the U.S. healthcare system $15,000,000,000 annually, all of which is preventable. The Committee has included $400,000,000 for testing and prevention of these conditions. The Committee intends that funds be used for grants to States for testing activities, and the prevention of STD infections like chlamydia that have been increasing dramatically in recent years."" We're not going to wade into the debate over whether the spending is appropriate for an economic stimulus bill. We're only ruling on whether there is $335 million in the House version of the bill for STD prevention programs. We note that while the proposed $335 million in the House bill includes prevention programs for STDs, it also includes prevention programs HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis prevention programs, which are not always transmitted sexually. So we find the claim .",true,"National, Economy, Stimulus, National Republican Congressional Committee, "
838,8965,NUS researchers use AI to successfully treat metastatic cancer patient,"September 5, 2018","This news release focuses on a paper from Singapore-based researchers who used artificial intelligence (AI) to treat cancer in a single patient. The release argues that this is a “gamechanger” and a “big step forward” that “is applicable to all diseases and all patients” — which are bold claims to make based on the treatment of only one patient. Unjustifiable language throughout and a lack of attention to key details like harms, cost and an explanation of the severe limitations of the research make this a weak and misleading release. There has been a lot of research focused on the use of AI to help diagnose cancers and develop treatment protocols — and it continues to be an area of great interest. However, it is difficult — if not impossible — to draw far-reaching conclusions from a single case. What costs, benefits and risks are associated with AI-directed treatment for cancers? A study like the one highlighted in this release simply cannot tell us. The release claims the researchers were able to improve treatment efficacy by adjusting treatment dose and presumably still minimizing adverse events. Again — impossible to prove based on a single patient. It is an interesting case study, and we look forward to learning the results of future research, but it is misleading (if not dishonest) to make sweeping claims based on the treatment of a single patient.","Matt Shipman,Andrae Vandross, MD,Kathlyn Stone","The AI used in this case is called the “CURATE.AI” platform. It’s not clear if the platform is proprietary. If it is, it is not clear what the cost would be for health care providers to access and make use of the platform. It is also not clear what level of training, and associated costs, would be needed for health care providers to be able to use the platform in a clinical setting. Given that the AI platform appears to be designed to create personalized treatments for each patient, the cost could be considerable. It’s hard to estimate, since the release does not address cost in any way. The release does not attempt to quantify benefits. In fact, it would be impossible for the release to address this issue in any meaningful way, given that the relevant study was of one patient. The release says that the patient was “successfully treated” — but what does that mean? Lower down in the release, readers are told that “disease progression was halted,” meaning that the cancer was not getting worse. Further, no information is given about the tumor’s biology nor can any conclusions be drawn in the absence of a comparator such as enzalutamide alone vs the combination. Readers are told that “patient care guided by CURATE.AI is currently ongoing.” In other words, by the time anyone is reading the release, the patient could be in remission. Or the cancer may have spread. Or the patient’s condition may not have changed at all. We just don’t know. AI is not perfect. AI programs can, and will, make mistakes. What might those mistakes mean in the context of cancer treatment? It’s not clear, and the release doesn’t address this. We know that clinical trials using “CURATE.AI-guided” therapies are underway, and that the patient highlighted in the news release is involved in a clinical trial. But we don’t know how any of those trials are going. Will those trials identify any risks or potential harms? How will medication dosages be adjusted to reduce side effects? That remains to be seen, and the release should not simply ignore the issue. If this single patient’s treatment was sufficient to warrant a news release, any potential harms (or even the absence of potential harms) should also be worth addressing. The release makes clear that it is focused only on one patient’s treatment. But that’s not good enough. The release should make clear that, while this patient’s results were promising, there are severe limitations on the extent to which the patient’s results can be extrapolated to a larger population. Instead, the release does just the opposite, calling a single case a “big step forward.” In addition, as noted above under “Explain Harms,” this patient was part of a clinical trial, and there are other clinical trials under way. Are they phase 1 trials? Phase 2? Phase 3? How many patients are involved? What are the study designs? The release raises more questions than it answers. No disease mongering here. Some context on the prevalence of prostate cancer would have been useful. It is not made clear who funded the relevant study, who funded the creation of CURATE.AI, or whether CURATE.AI has been patented or is under consideration for being marketed as a for-profit medical tool. CURATE.AI is far from the only AI tool that has been considered for use in cancer treatment. For example, HealthNewsReview.org wrote last year about a (failed) attempt to incorporate IBM’s Watson system into cancer treatment at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. And there are hundreds of papers that address various attempts to use AI, machine learning, or artificial neural networks in the context of cancer treatment. Here’s a review paper from 2006 that addresses 396 related papers that had already been published at that time. The release on CURATE.AI does not make clear how this new AI tool is different from or similar to the body of work in the field. We don’t expect a news release to offer a detailed overview of how the new work differs from what came before it, but we do expect a release to provide at least a broad idea of what sets the new work apart. The release does make clear that clinical trials are under way. That’s good. However, the release is written as if the clinical trials have already been completed successfully. For example, the release states that “CURATE.AI is applicable to all diseases and all patients.” There is, as far as can be discerned from everything else in the release, nothing that supports that statement. And despite the sweeping language used in the release, it is not at all clear when CURATE.AI may be available for clinical use. The release says that “a first generation of the [CURATE.AI] platform was previously validated in the clinic for single drug optimisation,” and that this single-patient study “demonstrates that CURATE.AI can optimise multi-drug regimens.” That’s enough to earn it a satisfactory rating here, but we’ll revisit that language under “Unjustifiable Language.” The release uses unsatisfactory language throughout. We’ll provide two examples here. The release tells readers that this study “demonstrates that CURATE.AI can optimise multi-drug regimens.” No, it doesn’t. This study focuses on the experience of one patient. Did the use of CURATE.AI improve the patient’s treatment? It’s impossible to tell — because it is one patient. We simply cannot determine what the cancer’s progression would have been, since we can only the see the data on one individual. The release also states that “CURATE.AI is applicable to all diseases and all patients” — a claim that the release (and related study) cannot support in any way.",false,"artificial intelligence (AI),cancer treatment,National University of Singapore"
839,758,"U.S. doctors' group says just stop vaping as deaths, illnesses rise.","September 9, 2019",The American Medical Association on Monday urged Americans to stop using electronic cigarettes of any sort until scientists have a better handle on the cause of 450 lung illnesses and at least five deaths related to the use of the products.,Julie Steenhuysen,"The AMA, one of the nation’s most influential physician groups, also called on doctors to inform patients about the dangers of e-cigarettes, including toxins and carcinogens, and swiftly report any suspected cases of lung illness associated with e-cigarette use to their state or local health department. The recommendation followed advice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday for people to consider not using e-cigarette products while it investigates the cause of the spate of severe lung illnesses associated with vaping. Many, but not all, of the cases have involved those who used the devices to vaporize oils containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis. CDC officials said some laboratories have identified vitamin E acetate in product samples and are investigating that as a possible cause of the illnesses. Public health experts have not found any evidence of infectious diseases and believe the lung illnesses are probably associated with a chemical exposure. Megan Constantino, 36, from St. Petersburg, Florida, quit vaping six days ago after hearing reports of the illnesses and deaths related to vaping. “It scared me into quitting,” she said. Like many users of vaping pens, Constantino picked up the device after quitting cigarette smoking three years ago, and said, “It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.”  She added, “I threw the last cartridge away. I took a picture of it and I literally cried.”   Constantino said many people who vape have been “on pins and needles” for the investigation results, and she is concerned that the reports of a link to vaping THC may give people an excuse to ignore the warnings. E-cigarettes are generally thought to be safer than traditional cigarettes, which kill up to half of all lifetime users, the World Health Organization says. But the long-term health effects of vaping are largely unknown. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has faced mounting pressure to curb a huge spike in teenage use of e-cigarettes, a trend that coincided with the rising popularity of Juul e-cigarettes. “We must not stand by while e-cigarettes continue to go unregulated. We urge the FDA to speed up the regulation of e-cigarettes and remove all unregulated products from the market,” AMA president Dr. Patrice Harris, said in a statement. Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, which advocates for cigarette smokers to switch to nicotine-based vaping devices, said the AMA should be “ashamed of themselves for playing politics with people’s health and protecting the profits of drug dealers.”  He criticized the AMA for “fearmongering about nicotine vaping products” while not mentioning “the very real risks of vaping illicit THC products.”  Juul Labs declined to comment.

A Facebook post says that under their proposal, immigrants in the country illegally also stand to benefit, getting billions of dollars. ""Pelosi’s new coronavirus bill allows illegals to receive billions in relief funds in past, current, and future payments,"" said text over a photo of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi holding a gavel, with a crowd of people, purportedly immigrants, in the background. The caption on the May 12 Facebook post said the payments ""would not just be a one-time check, they would give them past, current any future payments of YOUR money as 33 million Americans are unemployed."" The post is from We Build The Wall, Inc., a group that's raising money to build sections of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Pelosi does support a bill that would allow immigrants who are in the country illegally and who pay taxes to get coronavirus emergency aid from the federal government. But the Facebook post needs clarification and additional information. The Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or the HEROES Act, was introduced May 12 and passed the House May 15, 208-199, with only one Republican vote. Among the key provisions of the roughly $3 trillion bill, it gives nearly $1 trillion to state and local governments, creates a $200 billion hazard-pay fund for essential workers, and provides $75 billion to support coronavirus testing, contact tracing and patient isolation. The bill also offers a new round of direct payments to families — $1,200 per person and up to $6,000 per household. The payments would go out to people who filed tax returns for 2018 or 2019 (and to some who didn’t), with the total amount based on income. For instance, a single person who earned less than $75,000 would get $1,200; those who earned $75,000 or more would receive less. The proposal seeks to augment the financial assistance that started mid-April when one-time checks were sent under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act. Under the CARES Act, however, U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents were ineligible for a check if they filed a joint tax return with a spouse who used an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN. ITINs are issued by the IRS to people who don’t have a Social Security number, including immigrants in the country illegally, so they can use it to pay federal income taxes. (Some international students and researchers and their spouses also use ITINs.) The IRS in 2014 said ITIN filers pay over $9 billion in annual payroll taxes. So the proposed HEROES Act includes them in its aid package, and retroactively makes ITIN filers eligible for the CARES Act payment as well. The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, using IRS data, estimated that this provision would benefit more than 4.3 million adults and 3.5 million children in households of ITIN filers or of mixed immigration status, paying them a total $16.4 billion ($7 billion under the CARES Act and $9.4 billion under the HEROES Act). The beneficiary figures include ITIN filers as well as their spouses and children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Meg Wiehe, deputy executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said it was difficult to discern from the IRS data exactly how many prospective beneficiaries are immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Julia Gelatt, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said a lot of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents can get support through unemployment insurance, stimulus payments, food stamps and other public benefits. ITINs are used for federal tax reporting, but they do not provide legal immigration status, and immigrants in the country illegally are generally ineligible for federal public benefits, such as food stamps. The goal of the HEROES Act, as it relates to unauthorized immigrants and their family members, is to help people who are struggling financially and who have no access to other financial support, Gelatt said. The HEROES Act financial assistance isn’t exclusive to ITIN filers; U.S. citizens and green-card holders who file taxes using a Social Security number would also benefit, with the same aid amounts and income thresholds. The payments to all eligible people are estimated to cost more than $400 billion. A Facebook post said, ""Pelosi’s new coronavirus bill allows illegals to receive billions in relief funds in past, current, and future payments."" The HEROES Act, a proposal backed by Pelosi, would allow immigrants who are in the country illegally and who pay taxes to receive federal relief funds during the coronavirus pandemic. Immigrants who pay taxes using an ITIN would be eligible for an aid payment under the HEROES Act, and retroactively under the CARES Act, which corresponds to the ""current"" and ""past"" payments cited in the post. It’s unclear what is meant by ""future"" payment. We contacted We Build the Wall for comment, but did not hear back. A tax policy group estimated that if the HEROES Act became law as written, about $16.4 billion would go to households of ITIN filers or of mixed status.

844,14726,"Hillary Clinton Says Bernie Sanders ""has reversed his position on immunity"" for gun manufacturers and sellers.","January 17, 2016","So is Clinton right that Sanders flip-flopped on immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers? Sanders voted for the 2005 measure that provided broad liability exclusions for gunmakers and sellers. After months of Sanders and his staff defending the vote, Sanders’ position started to evolve in October. Sanders’ position three months ago -- that he would ""take another look"" at the liability question -- is consistent with his Jan. 16 news release saying he supported a proposal to rescind the immunity provisions. But to look back only to October doesn’t tell the full story, ignoring not only the 2003 and 2005 votes but also several instances in which Sanders or his staff defended those votes in interviews between June 2015 and early January 2016. That sounds like a flip-flop to us.",Louis Jacobson,"In the increasingly competitive Democratic primary for president, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has spent months hammering Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for his vote on a 2005 bill that provided gun makers, sellers and trade associations with significant protection against lawsuits. Now, after Sanders clarified his position on the issue, she’s calling him a flip-flopper. Sanders, who represents the small, rural state of Vermont where guns are widely accepted, has sometimes sided with advocates of gun rights on key legislation and sometimes sided with supporters of gun control. One of the primary examples where Sanders broke with Democrats is in supporting the gun liability bill, which was enacted in 2005. A similar bill also passed the U.S. House in 2003. Sanders, then serving in the House, voted for it both times. Clinton called on Sanders to ""stand up and say I got this one wrong"" in a Jan. 8 interview on MSNBC’s Hardball. About a week later, Sanders released a statement on the gun-liability issue in the run-up to the Jan. 17 Democratic debate in Charleston, S.C. In a news release, Sanders said, ""I’m pleased that this legislation is being introduced,"" referring to proposals by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to rescind portions of the 2005 law. ""As I have said for many months now, we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up,"" Sanders added. The Clinton camp portrayed this as a flip-flop during the Charleston debate. Clinton said, ""I am pleased to hear that Sen. Sanders has reversed his position on immunity, and I look forward to him joining with those members of Congress who have already introduced legislation."" The Sanders camp disagreed that this was a change of position. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver had told MSNBC, ""This is not a flip flop, this is consistent with the position he held earlier in the campaign."" So is Clinton’s portrayal accurate? We took a closer look. Sanders’ vote on the 2005 bill While the bill includes two relatively non-controversial provisions -- one on trigger locks and the other on armor-piercing bullets -- the most contentious elements of the 2005 bill, and the ones that drove overwhelming Democratic opposition at the time, deal with liability for gun makers and sellers. The official bill summary provides for broad-based immunity for gun sellers, but it also provides a few exceptions, such as: • Cases where a person transfers a firearm knowing that a violent crime or drug-trafficking crime will be committed with it; • Cases where a seller is negligent or a manufacturer or seller knowingly violated the law; • And cases involving an injury caused by a physical defect with the weapon when it was used as intended. What Sanders and his campaign said prior to Jan. 16 On numerous occasions, Sanders or his aides have expressed comfort with his past vote. In June 2015, Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, told Politico, ""I believe he would make the same vote"" today. In October, at a Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Sanders said, ""If somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and that murderer kills somebody with the gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer. That is not what a lawsuit should be about."" Sanders continued to make similar arguments into January 2016. Asked by CBS whether gun manufacturers should be held accountable for gun deaths, Sanders said, ""Of course not, that doesn't make any sense,"" he said, while adding that if guns fall into the hands of criminals, ""Of course you hold the gun manufacturers liable."" At the same time, Sanders has increasingly fine-tuned his stance, saying he’d be open to reconsidering his vote on the 2005 measure. In an October 2015 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Sanders said he was ""willing to see changes"" in the gun-liability provision: ""Can we take another look at that liability issue? Yes."" Then, in January, a few days before the campaign issued its news release on gun liability, Sanders told a crowd in Iowa, ""I think we should take another look at that legislation and get rid of those provisions which allow gun manufacturers to act irresponsibly."" The Jan. 16 news release In the news release, Sanders expressed support for the Blumenthal-Schiff initiative to rescind the liability portions of the 2005 law. The trigger-lock and armor-piercing-ammunition provisions would not be overturned. The sponsors said they will try to advance the Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act as an amendment to an appropriations bill, according to the New York Times. On the Jan. 17 edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Sanders explained that in 2005, ""there were things in (the bill) that I did not like and I was willing to rethink. We have rethought it. There's a bill apparently being introduced, I like that bill, it makes some good changes and we will be supportive of it."" Sanders did say in his news release that he will be proposing an amendment to the Blumenthal and Schiff bills to require the Commerce Department to monitor and report on the law’s impact in rural areas on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, sold by non-negligent local gun stores. This, he indicated, was consistent with his past concerns about the threat of lawsuits against small gun shops serving primarily rural areas of Vermont. Our ruling So is Clinton right that Sanders flip-flopped on immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers? Sanders voted for the 2005 measure that provided broad liability exclusions for gunmakers and sellers.

Swept by lake effect storms, parts of western New York including Buffalo, received as much as seven feet (2 meters) of snow, an amount equal to a year’s worth of accumulation for the region. Such storms occur when cold air moves across warmer Great Lake waters and can dump heavy snowfall when they hit land. Temperatures in western New York will stay above freezing through Tuesday night, with highs of nearly 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) on Sunday and nearly 60 F (16 C) on Monday, the Weather Service said. “The warming will bring melting. The melting will bring water. Water will bring floods,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference. “We are preparing now for more flooding than we have seen in a long, long time,” he said. “We’ve never had this much snow and this much melting of this much snow in a short period of time.”  Some areas should expect five (152 cm) to six feet (183 cm) of water, Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said. To prepare, area residents said they were moving valuables out of their basements. Sections of the New York State Thruway will reopen on Friday afternoon to move vehicles and help remove snow, Cuomo said. Some 140 miles (225 km) of the thruway had been closed. So far, at least 13 deaths have been blamed on the weather. The most recent reported death was a person found buried in snow in a car in Cheektowaga, while two nursing home residents died in an evacuation of a Cheektowaga facility, officials said. Two people on Thursday died of exposure. Erie County officials said they had suffered mental illness and were found outside. Eight deaths were reported earlier in the week.

850,8662,Ardern's online messages keep spirits up in New Zealand's coronavirus lockdown.,"March 30, 2020","Hours after New Zealand imposed a nationwide lockdown to beat a coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern took to Facebook, livestreaming in a sweater from bed, to “check in” on citizens and tell them of the day’s events.",Praveen Menon,"Ardern’s news conferences for more than 30 minutes a day, taking queries, streaming Facebook videos and posting pictures on Instagram, offer a contrast with some world leaders who have stumbled through confusing briefings about virus combat plans. “I thought I would jump online quickly and check in with everyone...as we all prepare to hunker down for a few weeks,” she said in one of her social media messages, seen and cheered by millions in lockdown. “This feels like the comfort of being tucked into bed at night by my mum,” said a viewer who responded to the post. “Thanks for checking in with us.”   New Zealand’s tally of 589 virus infections, and one death, is far smaller than other countries, such as giant neighbor Australia, which has 4,200 cases and 17 deaths. Thursday’s lockdown is expected to have far-reaching effect on the export-oriented economy of the nation of five million. But the 39-year-old prime minister’s clear communication has garnered praise, even from her fiercest critics. “I think she communicates really clearly and really well,” John Key, a former prime minister and senior leader of the opposition National Party said on a radio show.

Ardern took the helm of the Labour-led government in October 2017, as the youngest female prime minister at the time, and became only the second elected leader to give birth while in office, after Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto. Her compassionate yet decisive actions after last year’s mass shooting at two Christchurch mosques drew global praise. But facing domestic criticism for her government’s handling of housing shortages and the economy, Ardern is expected to face a tough re-election contest in September.

851,33634,Owning a chihuahua can help cure a person of asthma.,"May 21, 2008","Beliefs that canines can be pressed into accepting human illness and thereby freeing human sufferers from their physical maladies are quite old. For instance, an 1898 folklore journal examined a Midwestern folk remedy that stated: “The Negro sometimes sleeps with a young dog in order to transmit rheumatism to the dog.”",Snopes Staff,"Asthma is an inflammatory disorder of the bronchial tubes that affects more than 17 million Americans and causes more than 5,000 deaths per year. It is also the most common chronic childhood disorder, affecting 6.3 million children (approximately 1 in 13 school-aged kids). Although numerous medications exist that work to keep asthma in check, there is no cure for this malady. Because not all asthma medications are equally effective on all sufferers, it is therefore to be expected that at least some who live with this illness look to the world of folk medicine and superstition for relief from the crushing inability to breathe. In addition to various herbs, nostrums, and rituals said to alleviate asthma symptoms, a surprisingly widespread belief positions one particular breed of man’s best friend as an asthma cure. Chihuahuas, it is said, will take asthma out of a home, either their presence working to wipe out the disease, or the animals themselves soaking up the illness resident in human masters and so transferring it to themselves. (The rumor exists in both forms: something about these dogs kills asthma, or chihuahuas serve as canine illness sponges.) [Collected via e-mail, August 2004]  I have encountered a weird one that is apparently quite popular in the Georgia US area: chihuahua dogs will ‘take on’ a child’s asthma. The dog will pick out the one in the family with asthma and sleep on their chest, will cough, and one day will cough up black stuff and this cures the asthma sufferer. I couldn’t believe my ears – my neighbor believes this 100% as advised by both her MD and a vet, she tried it and claims this has cured her son of asthma. I am now finding that many folks around here have heard of this. [Collected via e-mail, May 2008]  I have heard from numerous people that if a person who has asthma owns a chihuahua the dog will actually exhibit asthma symptoms and the human’s attack will be less severe. I ask because I have a chihuahua and have recently been diagnosed with asthma. It seems farfetched, but my dog actually exhibits breathing problems and I can’t help but wander if there is a chance that I am making her sick. Consequently, many families of asthmatic children have rushed to purchase these dogs and install them as family pets. Some believers in this cure insist the child must sleep with the chihuahua if the remedy is to be effected; others also specify that the dog must lie on the child’s chest. When those who pass along the news of this cure advance a source for their information, they will often says that the chihuahua remedy began with the Aztecs. Some will add that the Aztecs revered the chihuahua as the “ruler of the nose” and thought it had the power to cure various ailments in addition to asthma. Impressive as that sounds, there’s only scant reason to believe Aztecs had anything to do with the development of the belief that this particular dog would cure this particular disease. The Aztecs certainly did like this little dog: while it is rumored that the chihuahua started out as a foodstuff for them, the small canine eventually came to be regarded as a spiritual guide that would help a dead Aztec make his way in the afterlife, with part of that process involving the animal’s absorbing the sins of the person who’d died. This information bears enough of a resemblance to the “chihuahuas cure asthma” rumor (i.e., it involves the notion that chihuahuas were used to take on something noxious their human masters wanted to be rid of) that the Aztec connection cannot be completely dismissed   More plausible is the explanation that the rumor became attached to this particular pooch because a great many chihuahuas wheeze and make breathing noises the sound like someone struggling with asthma. It can therefore sound (especially to those desperate for a cure) that the dog is drawing the asthma from the sufferer and taking it up himself. (For worried pet owners out there, we note that this not the case: asthma does not get passed from human to dog.) Unfortunately for asthma sufferers, the chihuahua remedy doesn’t work. While it is true that these creatures are somewhat less likely to provoke allergies than most other breeds of dogs, owning one will not in itself cure asthma. (Even in terms of providing canine companionship for allergy sufferers, these short-haired dogs aren’t a magic bullet: they can still stir up all the usual symptoms of asthma because it’s not fur that is the allergen; it’s substances contained in dander and bodily secretions. However, smaller dogs and dogs with single-layered coats generally produce less dander, and chihuahuas possess both these qualities.) The belief about chihuahuas as an asthma cure has been around for a very long time; we found it written up in a 1956 folklore journal and a 1965 medical journal. One of the reasons for the rumor’s longevity has to do with the nature of asthma in children: about half of young sufferers lose their symptoms sometime during childhood or adolescence. That inexplicable loss, coupled with the presence in the home of the four-legged asthma cure (the chihuahua), works to entrench belief in the fiction that the dog cures the disease. In this sense, the belief is akin to the various “wart cures“ that folklore advocates for the treatment of children afflicted with such bumpy growths: The body’s eventual triumph over the virus is mistakenly attributed to some external cure, such as rubbing these benign skin tumors with bean pods or snails or wishing them onto the occupants of passing hearses.",false,"Critter Country, Wild Inaccuracies"
854,35887,"When U.S. President Donald Trump took office, he inherited a “bare” Strategic National Stockpile that lacked an adequate supply of mechanical ventilators that would have aided the nation at the start of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.","September 28, 2020","What's true: Stockpiles of some types of personal protective equipment such as N95 masks were depleted by the Obama administration’s response to the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, and had not been replenished by the time the COVID-19 outbreak began. What's false: The ventilator supply, specifically, was not depleted under the Obama administration, though it did fall short of what experts said would be needed in the event of a severe pandemic.",Madison Dapcevich,"At the onset of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly claimed that he inherited a “bare” Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) that lacked an adequate supply of ventilators from the administration of former President Barack Obama, hindering Trump’s ability to adequately respond to the growing number of coronavirus cases across the nation. We revisited the timeline of the pandemic and the various (and contradictory) statements issued by Trump and his administration to check the accuracy of this claim. The SNS is overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and is allocated as a resource to supplement state and local authorities in their response to public health emergencies. In addition to many state stockpiles, the federal stockpile includes medicines, supplies, and devices needed for life-saving care that are strategically located at secret warehouse locations around the country. According to a timeline published by the Department of Health and Human Services, the stockpile has been used at least 13 times since its 1999 creation, including during responses to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, and 2005 hurricanes Katrina and Rita. A mechanical ventilator is a breathing machine used to assist a patient suffering from respiratory distress, or a condition that makes it difficult for them to breathe on their own. SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the 2020 pandemic, causes COVID-19, one such respiratory condition that can make it difficult for an infected person to breathe on their own. Concern over whether the U.S. had enough ventilators took center stage in early 2020 — shortly after the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11. When New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo asked the federal government for additional ventilators, Trump responded by criticizing Cuomo’s handling of the pandemic, saying that the state should have stockpiled ventilators. During a March 26 press briefing, Trump tried to buck the blame for a shortage of ventilators, saying that he had taken over an “empty shelf.” The president reiterated the claim just over a week later, adding that the depleted stockpile he supposedly inherited impacted his administration’s ability to respond to the pandemic. Hey, I inherited — we, this administration — we inherited a broken system, both militarily, but we’ve rebuilt our military where we now have so much ammunition, whereas you remember a very important general said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” They wanted to save money on ammunition. They didn’t want to save money because they spent money like nobody ever spent money. But you know what? We now have a great military rebuilt. And we have so much ammunition, we don’t know what to do with it. Okay? And that’s a nice feeling to have. But they also gave us empty cupboards. The cupboard was bare. You’ve heard the expression: “The cupboard was bare.” So we took over a stockpile where the cupboard was bare and where the testing system was broken and old. And we redid it. Though Trump repeatedly blamed the Obama administration for leaving behind an empty stockpile and falsely took credit for restocking the ventilator supplies, he said on more than one occasion that the U.S. had enough ventilators in the weeks following the pandemic declaration. In the April 7 press briefing, Admiral Brett Giroir, assistant secretary of HHS, said that the number of ventilators is not a “number that we give out” but said that there were thousands remaining in the stockpile. Trump quickly added that there were 9,000 breathing machines. In an April 8 Tweet, the White House said that it had shipped out 8,000 ventilators and had an “additional 10,000 ready to go.” An op-ed written by Vice President Mike Pence added that the SNS “hadn’t been refilled since the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009, and it had only 10,000 ventilators on hand” in March — an inadequate number given the extent of the pandemic — but that by the June 16 publication of his piece, there were more than 30,000 ventilators in the SNS and that the administration was “well on [its] way to building 100,000 ventilators in 100 days.” It appeared that the Trump administration initially recognized that the ventilator supply was inadequate to respond to the pandemic, but failed to supplement the limited inventory despite promises to do so. The discrepancy continued well into 2020. Some references: While it is true that the Trump administration had inherited a depleted supply of some personal protective equipment (PPE) like N95 respirator masks, it is not accurate to say that the stockpile was left “bare” or depleted of ventilators. The SNS had 16,600 ventilators “immediately available for use” at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a spokesperson with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) who spoke with FactCheck.org in June 2020: [T]here were 16,660 ventilators in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) inventory immediately available for use when the SNS began deploying ventilators in March 2020 in support of the COVID-19 response. All of these ventilators were serviced, recertified and operable. An additional 2,425 ventilators were in maintenance at that time as part of the normal and routine maintenance process. Every ventilator and resupply kit in the SNS is serviced regularly by a contracted commercial vendor to meet or exceed the manufacturer’s recommended maintenance schedule. In general, prior to March of this year, the SNS stored approximately 19,000 ventilators in its inventory for many years, and this number fluctuated on any given day depending on the number of ventilators in scheduled maintenance. … [I]n January 2017 the total number of ventilators in the SNS inventory immediately available for use would not have been much different than what the SNS had immediately available for use in March 2020. The spokesperson added that the stockpile would likely have held the same number of ventilators in January 2016 when Trump was inaugurated, suggesting that ventilator stock left by the Obama administration was considered adequate by HHS when Trump took office. Snopes contacted the HHS to confirm the above figures, but had not received a response at the time of publication. However, given the nature of the 2020 pandemic, health experts argued that ventilator inventory at the onset of the outbreak was inadequate, and the Trump administration should have immediately taken measures to increase the inventory of ventilators and other emergency medical supplies. As part of the COVID-19 response, the SNS deployed more than 14,500 tons of cargo to states, according to data published on Sept. 16, 2020. An HHS document submitted to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform criticized the low number of ventilators that had been distributed from the stockpile in April 2020, suggesting that the outsourced 7,920 ventilators were inadequate compared with the estimated need of 139,000 machines. “Now that the national stockpile has been depleted of critical equipment, it appears that the Administration is leaving states to fend for themselves, to scour the open market for these scarce supplies, and to compete with each other and federal agencies in a chaotic, free-for-all bidding war,” said committee chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney in a statement.",false,"Politics Medical, COVID-19"
856,36963," A former Marine called out Sarah Palin for blaming her son, Trek Palin’s, arrest for domestic violence and weapons violations on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in an open letter. ","January 26, 2016",Marine’s Open Letter to Sarah Palin-Authorship Confirmed!,  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"We can confirm that a former Marine wrote an open letter to Sarah Palin in which he said she had used PTSD to “divert blame from her family’s abhorrent, violent behavior.” The open letter surfaced days after Sarah Palin said Trek Palin’s arrest for domestic violence was linked to PTSD, and more specifically, to President Obama for not doing more to help veterans. Palin delivered the remarks in a January XX campaign stop with Donald Trump in Kentucky, the Daily Mail reports: ‘I guess it’s kind of the elephant in the room – because my own family, going through what we’re going through today with my son, a combat vet having served in a Stryker brigade, fighting for you all, America, in the war zone. But my son, like so many others, they come back a bit different. They come back hardened,’ Palin said at the Wednesday rally. ‘They come back wondering if there is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have given so sacrificially to this country, and that starts at the top,’ Palin said. She continued to say it’s a ‘shame’ that military personnel come home and ‘have to wonder if they’re respected anymore’. ‘So when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with, and it makes me realize more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America’s finest that we’ll have that commander in chief who will respect them and honor them,’ she said. In response, former Marine and Navy Officer Chris Marks wrote the open letter. The open letter, which was published on Marks’ personal blog site, begins: I am a former US Marine and US Navy Officer with a Combat Action Ribbon as well as service connected disabilities. I am also a Republican. I have also served with, and am friends with, dozens of combat veterans who suffer daily from various injuries and wounds to include PTSD. I recently read your comments related to PTSD in which you attempted to excuse your son’s arrest on domestic abuse charges and firearm charges by referencing his supposed PTSD. Based upon your previous comments I am not surprised that you would choose to use this very serious condition as a political football and, once again, attempt to divert blame from your own family’s abhorrent, violent behavior. Marks also called for Palin to use her “celebrity status” to help veterans in a more productive, less political manner. And Marks wasn’t the only veteran that took exception with Palin’s comments. Other veterans who spoke out in the media said Palin had used “dangerous stereotyping” about PTSTD and veterans in her remarks, the Boston Globe reports,",true,"Government, Politics"

The best available data suggests that he’s right about the United States being No. 1 in the world in natural gas production, though it’s more in dispute whether his administration deserves credit (or, in the eyes of some environmentalists, blame) for ""part"" of this development, as Obama put it.",Louis Jacobson,"During a recent radio address, President Barack Obama said the nation’s energy picture was robust. ""Thanks in part to our all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here at home than we buy from the rest of the world,"" Obama said on Jan. 18, 2014. ""We generate more renewable energy than ever, and more natural gas than anybody."" We’ve previously checked one of these claims. Earlier this month, we gave a True rating to Obama’s claim that ""for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world."" But we hadn’t fact-checked his claim that we generate ""more natural gas than anybody."" So we’ll check it here. We turned to two widely used sources for energy data. One is the Statistical Review of World Energy, published by petroleum giant BP. The other is the website of the Energy Information Administration, an office of the U.S. Department of Energy. According to BP’s data, United States natural gas production in 2012 was 619 million tons of oil equivalent, or 20.4 percent of the world. The only nation that came close to that was the Russian Federation, which produced 533 million tons of oil equivalent, or 17.6 percent of the world total. So by this measurement, Obama was correct. And the Energy Information Administration data concurs that the United States was No. 1 in the world. According to EIA -- which has figures as recent as 2011 -- the gross natural gas production by the United States was 28.5 trillion cubic feet, or 19.7 percent of the world total. The figure for Russia was 23.7 trillion cubic feet, or 16.4 percent of the world total. That said, there are still some issues to factor in. One is that there’s no guarantee that every country’s data is reliable, since not every nation has put the same effort into researching the question -- or, if they have, they may not be interested in sharing accurate information with economic rivals. While it would seem less likely that Russia would undercount its production than overcount it, it can’t be ruled out that, intentionally or unintentionally, the Russian figure for production is higher than these tables would suggest. The second issue is whether it’s justified for Obama to claim a share of the credit for the United States’ burst of natural gas production. It’s nothing new that the United States is at or near the top in natural gas production internationally. According to BP’s data, the United States and Russia have traded off the No. 1 and No. 2 spots in natural gas production ever since the data separated out the Russian Federation from the old Soviet Republics in 1985. Since 1985, the United States has outpaced the Russian Federation in 13 years: 1985, 1986, 1995, 1997 to 2002 and 2009 to 2012. During the same period, the Russian Federation outpaced the United States from 1987 to 1994, 1996 and 2003 to 2008. The United States’ lead over Russia has increased during Obama’s tenure. The United States produced 12 percent more natural gas than Russia in 2009, but 16 percent more than Russia in 2012. A big reason is the expansion of natural gas extracted from shale, using advanced technologies known as fracking. In some areas of the country, fracking has kicked off an economic boom, and measured by carbon emissions at the point of combustion, natural gas represents an improvement over oil or coal. But environmentalists argue that there are other downsides to fracking, from the risk of localized water contamination to higher carbon emissions when the entire drilling and transportation cycle is considered. We won’t referee this debate, but we will note that both advocates of drilling and environmentalists have criticized Obama, either for being too cautious about promoting natural gas development or being too eager to support it. When we looked at Obama’s campaign promise to expedite oil and gas drilling from domestic shale formations, we rated it, noting that the numbers can be framed in ways that can either support or weaken the case that Obama has sped up the process of developing oil and natural gas resources. Obama did issue an executive order in 2012, titled, ""Supporting Safe and Responsible Development of Unconventional Domestic Natural Gas Resources"" that established an interagency working group to ""facilitate coordinated"" federal efforts on new types of natural gas extraction. ""While natural gas production is carried out by private firms, and states are the primary regulators of onshore oil and gas activities, the federal government has an important role to play by regulating oil and gas activities on public and Indian trust lands, encouraging greater use of natural gas in transportation, supporting research and development aimed at improving the safety of natural gas development and transportation activities, and setting sensible, cost-effective public health and environmental standards to implement federal law and augment state safeguards,"" the order said. Alan Krupnick, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank that tracks energy policy, said that the administration at the very least ""has not interfered with the shale gas revolution, which I'd say is something. In my view, the Environmental Protection Agency has not been heavy-handed on environmental concerns"" relating to natural gas. Still, as the administration acknowledged, the advances in shale-based natural gas extraction largely developed due to the private sector. And given the long-term pattern, it’s clear that natural gas production in the United States was already high before Obama took office. ""Obama's claim, implied or voiced, rings hollow,"" said Joel Darmstadter, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future. ""The shale gas fracking revolution, especially in its development phase, antedates Obama's presidency. And the bonanza it has created and the dramatic price declines it has spurred don't seem to me to be traceable to any of his administration's policies."" Our ruling Obama said, ""Thanks in part to our all-of-the-above strategy for American energy,"" the United States generates ""more natural gas than anybody."" The best available data suggests that he’s right about the United States being No. 1 in the world in natural gas production, though it’s more in dispute whether his administration deserves credit (or, in the eyes of some environmentalists, blame) for ""part"" of this development, as Obama put it.",true,"National, Energy, Barack Obama, "

On the aspect of accountability Locks of Love scored 92 out of 100, with more than 92% of the charity’s expenses allocated to program costs. Less than 7% of expenses went to administrative costs and salaries, and CEO Linda Borum’s most recently listed salary (for fiscal year 2015) was a modest $64,866.",Snopes Staff,"In 1997, a longtime sufferer of alopecia areata founded the now popular charity Locks of Love to provide children who suffer from hair loss due to medical conditions with high-quality wigs and hairpieces. And since at least 2005, Internet-based rumors have circulated claiming that the vast majority of hair donated to Locks of Love is resold to make commercially-vended wigs, that the charity provides very few free hairpieces relative to the volume of hair donated each year, and that most of those wigs aren’t made actually available to children with cancer. Many critics have claimed that children lucky enough to receive wigs were charged exorbitant prices and made to endure a rigorous screening process:  Today I got a HUGE surprise! As I was preparing our Baby Girl Shiloh’s hair to send to Locks of Love some of my wise friends informed me that they charge patients for their hair and not to give them Shiloh’s hair. Me: I asked, “patients with cancer? That we are donating hair to?” Friends: “Yes! Could charge them $1000.00.” So I just called and talked to Locks of Love and sure enough they charge people for the hair that is being donated to them!! Me: “Y’all charge? People with cancer? My 9 year old is giving u her hair!” Lady: Well, depending on how much money the family has …” Me: “Wow. Thanks, have a great day!” Recently I cut off a little over 11 inches of my hair and was interested in donating it to an organization who would make good use of it. Hair donation is important because it costs approximately $1,800 for a complete hair replacement. Locks of Love is one of the most popular groups for hair donation but after research I was highly disappointed. They use less than 1/3 of the hair they receive from donations. They should not be considered a charity but a for-profit business because they do not give hair to those in need, they SELL it. Not only do they make children pay for their wigs, but they make them jump through hoops just to receive one. They are known to deny wigs to children with dim prognosis’ because they would not get enough use from the wig. I looked for other organizations after reading about Locks of Love. Pantene Beautiful lengths is a non-profit charity that accepts hair 8″ and longer for donation, their hair replacements go to adults. Wigs for Kids is another private non-profit group that specializes in hair replacements for children. Doing your research before donating anything is extremely important because you don’t want to help empower corrupt “charities”  Before examining such rumors, we have to consider the scope of a charity like Locks of Love. Hair donation charities have a primary function of raising money and providing hairpieces to people who suffer from chronic hair loss, but their secondary purpose is rather unique: while contributing to most other charities requires available cash, Locks of Love enables anyone who can grow healthy hair to contribute. Because of the relatively low barrier to participation, Locks of Love and similar charitable entities remain popular among children and youth groups seeking to engage in good works. While hair donation is a particularly accessible form of charitable service, the ease of contributing has triggered skepticism and the fear that well-intentioned kids are being hooked and crooked for their good deeds. In the March 2015 Facebook post quoted above, the author claimed that Locks of Love only used a third of donated hair to craft wigs and sold the remaining two thirds to commercial hairpiece makers. Locks of Love themselves say that as much as 80% of donated hair isn’t used to make hairpieces directly, but according to that organization and the wigmaker with whom they work, most donated hair cannot be used because it does not meet the necessary criteria for making hairpieces: But although charities have been highly effective at stirring the passions of donors, they have been less successful at finding a use for the mountains of hair sent to them as a result. As much as 80 percent of the hair donated to Locks of Love, the best known of the charities, is unusable for its wigs, the group says. Many people are unaware of the hair donation guidelines and send in hair that is gray, wet or moldy, too short, or too processed, some of which is immediately thrown away. Even hair that survives the winnowing may not go to the gravely ill, but may be sold to help pay for charities’ organizational costs. Locks of Love sends the best of the hair it receives to a wig manufacturer, Taylormade Hair Replacement in Millbrae, Calif., which weeds through the selection still further, rejecting up to half. “We hate throwing it away but ultimately we have to clear the place out,” said Greg Taylor, the president and owner of Taylormade. “There is a disparity between the hundreds and hundreds of braids and ponytails and the number of hairpieces we’ve produced.” The interview quoted above (which took place in 2007) made mention of the sale of hair to keep the charity running. However, such an admission is not necessarily suspect. As explained earlier, the charity functions in part to convert a resource nearly all can provide (hair) into a usable product for children in need. If that need is aided by selling some donated hair to fund manufacturing costs and the charity’s organizational needs, the charity’s primary goal (acquiring and providing hairpieces to children) is still being served. Locks of Love’s web site addresses the matter of wig costs to recipients, noting that hairpieces are provided free to families who lack the means to purchase them. For others, the hairpieces are available on a sliding scale of prices depending upon their ability to pay: “We provide hairpieces and repairs free of charge or on a sliding scale based on the financial need of those responsible for the children.” Also at issue is the matter of who the primary recipients of wigs are. One aspect of rumor states that children with cancer were not primary candidates for Locks of Love, another thing the charity itself has frequently explained: Most of our recipients suffer from alopecia areata. Others have experienced hair loss from radiation therapy and chemotherapy, severe burns or trauma, and various other genetic and dermatological conditions. While those looking to donate hair may prefer their donations help cancer sufferers, Locks of Love was founded by and operates primarily for sufferers of alopecia. This focus of the group does not constitute any subterfuge or lie by omission, as some rumors insinuated. The Locks of Love FAQ also addresses the sale of hair: Hair that is short, gray, or otherwise unusable will be sold to help offset manufacturing costs. Locks of Love DOES NOT throw hair away unless it is wet and moldy or not bundled in a braid or ponytail when it is received. Earlier rumors about Locks of Love claimed that the organization failed to account for a vast quantity of donated hair:  Human hair, especially Caucasian hair, is a valuable commodity. And Locks of Love admits it does sell some of the hair, it just can’t say how much. “We can’t figure out where that goes,” said Kent Chao. He runs Nonprofit Investor, a watchdog group that analyzes charities from a business perspective for potential investors. So they are more detailed than your typical charity watchdog. But when he made those requests to Lock of Love, Chao said, “They indicated that Locks of Love does not count, track or keep lists of any hair donations they receive.” “The missing pieces of information are actually fairly significant,” said Marc Owens, the former director of the tax-exempt division of the IRS. He said the charity’s 990 tax filings show a “program service revenue” of nearly $580,000. But there is no explanation or breakdown. “There are just so many omissions, that it’s hard to say for certain that any of the data on the return is accurate,” he told KPIX 5. However, a number of factors were elided in that report. The value of donated hair when applied to actual hairpieces provided to children relied on a projection, not actual processing and manufacturing costs. Also, Locks of Love must account for their incoming and outgoing expenses each year in tax filings. If the group truly trafficked heavily in black market hair, significant discrepancies would arise in their accounting books. Despite the organization’s admitted lack of record-keeping in respect to hair received (for which there is no clear monetary value), any significant revenues from the sale of hair would have appeared on their ledgers as income.",false,Business

But lumping the women’s efforts into the ""past year,"" Keene inaccurately places the blame for all self-abortion attempts on restrictions on abortion clinics that Texas passed in 2013.",Warren Fiske,"On the opening day of the Virginia General Assembly, abortion rights advocates held a news conference to urge lawmakers to sign a ""statement of intent in support of women’s health and rights."" Tarina Keene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, said it’s time to stop an avalanche of abortion restrictions that have been approved in Virginia and across the nation during the past five years and that she said are threatening women’s health. ""Recently, research out of Texas revealed that due to the rapidly declining number of women’s health centers in that state, over 100,000 women - 100,000 women - have attempted to self-induce abortion in the past year alone,"" Keene said. ""This is what happens when you shame and degrade women,"" she added. ""You encourage hateful, violent rhetoric and attack the fundamental rights of women."" We wondered whether her jaw-dropping figure - more than 100,000 Texas women in one year attempted self-abortion - is correct. Keene referred us to a November 2015 report by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas, a research group that focuses on the impact of the state’s reproductive laws. The organization conducted a survey of 779 Texas women ages 18 to 49 in December 2014 and January 2015. When the participants were asked whether they ""ever"" tried to end a pregnancy on their own, 1.7 percent said yes. The researchers were concerned that some of the women might not be willing to admit they’ve tried to self-abort. So they also asked each participant whether her best friend ""ever"" tried to end a pregnancy by herself. The response: 1.8 percent said they were ""sure"" their best friend had done so, and another 2.3 percent ""suspected"" that had happened. The researchers concluded that the proportion of Texas women who have tried to self-abort falls somewhere between the 1.7 percent who said they did so and the 4.1 percent who said they either were sure or suspected their best friend had tried. That converts to somewhere between 100,000 and 240,000 women ages 18 to 49 in the Lone Star State. Again, this is an estimate of the women who tried ""ever"" in their lives to self-abort. Keene makes a significant error in saying the research shows that more than 100,000 of the incidents occurred ""in the last year alone."" The timing is important, because a number of pro-abortion groups are linking the study’s figure to a series of abortion restrictions Texas enacted in 2013. The state banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy; required abortion clinics to meet the same standards as hospital-style surgical centers; and mandated that a doctor have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where he or she performs abortions. ""Definitely, the timing of most of the self-induced abortions is not connected to the legislation,"" said Daniel Grossman,who headed the research team. He told us he plans to continue surveying Texas women. ""To make any estimate whether self-abortion goes up because of these laws will take years to study,"" Grossman said. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a challenge from reproductive rights groups that the laws block constitutional rights to an abortion. More than half of the 41 abortion clinics in Texas have closed since 2012, just before the legislation was introduced. The researchers noted that self-abortion rates are likely to be higher in Texas than in the rest of the nation, in part because of its shared border with Mexico where Misoprostol, a drug that effectively can end pregnancies, ""is often available in pharmacies without a prescription."" Other methods reported by those who said they knew someone who attempted a self-induced abortion included herbs or homeopathic remedies; getting hit in the stomach; using alcohol or illegal drugs; and taking hormonal pills. Our ruling Keene said that ""due to the rapidly declining number of women’s health care centers"" in Texas, more than ""100,000 women have attempted to self-induce abortion in the past year alone."" She’s wrong. The study to which she refers estimates that between 100,000 and 240,000 Texas women ages 18 to 49 attempted to self-abort at some point in their lives.

Witness the return of a decades-old canard holding that Vince Foster, a longtime friend and associate of Bill and Hillary Clinton, did not commit suicide in 1993 (contrary to the findings of multiple investigations), but instead was murdered by the Clintons “because he knew too much.” Since the mid-1990s, Foster’s name has held a place of prominence on the viral list of “Clinton Body Bags,” a constantly growing roster of Clinton contacts who supposedly died under “mysterious circumstances.” Like the theory that Foster didn’t really kill himself, the rest of the “Body Bags” list has been discredited time and time again. The Vince Foster theory persists because it has a partisan fan base. While campaigning for the presidency, Donald Trump lent it credence during a 2016 interview in which he called the circumstances of Foster’s death “very fishy,” the Washington Post reported: “He had intimate knowledge of what was going on,” Trump said, speaking of Foster’s relationship with the Clintons at the time. “He knew everything that was going on, and then all of a sudden he committed suicide.” He added, “I don’t bring [Foster’s death] up because I don’t know enough to really discuss it.

I don’t do that because I don’t think it’s fair.” The rumor cropped up in September 2018 in the form of a meme shared by two hyperpartisan Facebook pages, Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children and Cold Dead Hands:  The timing was curious. “On this date in 1993,” the meme says, “Vince Foster went to Fort Marcy Park and shot himself 3 times in the back of the head to avoid testifying against Hillary Clinton.” But Foster committed suicide in July of that year, not September. After some searching, we found that the meme had been previously posted on 20 July 2018, when that part of the claim, at least, would have been accurate. The decision to re-share it in September 2018 (assuming there was any thought behind it at all) may have had to do with the fact that the Senate confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had just run into a roadblock in the form of an accusation of sexual assault by a woman who said Kavanaugh groped her at a party in the 1980s. The most likely explanation for bringing up Foster would seem to be that it was meant to divert attention from a Trump-related scandal to a Clinton-related scandal, but there’s a complication: Kavanaugh led the investigation of Vince Foster’s death by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in the mid-1990s, an investigation that confirmed (ironically, in this context) Foster’s death was indeed a suicide. Kavanaugh has been condemned, on the one hand, for reopening an investigation that had already been concluded by a previous independent counsel, Robert Fiske, and “tormenting” Foster’s family (in the words of liberal pundit Paul Begala) on the basis of rumors that the Clintons were somehow involved in his death. But Kavanaugh’s involvement has also given rise to a strange new addendum to the conspiracy theory in far-right circles, namely that in exonerating the Clintons he helped cover up wrongdoing on their part. Right-wing pundit Andrew Napolitano gave voice to this accusation during a Fox News Channel appearance: You remember Vince Foster who killed himself in the White House? How did his body get from the White House to Fort Marcy Park? Who was the prosecutor in charge of figuring out how his body got there? Who was the prosecutor that exonerated Hillary and the thugs that moved his body? A young Brett Kavanaugh. Whatever the motivation behind its re-sharing, the meme got almost everything wrong. What’s true is that Foster killed himself in 1993 (although it was in July, not September), and that he did so in Fort Marcy Park in Virginia (not, contrary to Napolitano’s claim, in the White House). But the sarcastic claim that he “shot himself three times in the back of the head” (implying that it wasn’t really a suicide) is a fabrication. Every investigation to date has found that he shot himself once, in the mouth, with his own handgun. The implication that his death was connected to an expectation of his giving testimony against the Clintons is equally false. Foster, who was a White House deputy counsel at the time, was distraught over accusations of malfeasance involving the White House Travel Office, and he had sought treatment for depression prior to his suicide. Foster consistently maintained that the Travel Office scandal was baseless. As the Washington Post‘s Glenn Kessler wrote: Yes, there is a fringe minority of people who will believe in just about every conspiracy theory. There are hacks who believe that Foster died in the White House and that his body was moved. There was even a member of Congress who fired bullets into a cantaloupe (or was it a watermelon?) in an effort to prove that Foster was killed. But there were also five official investigations into Foster’s death, conducted by professional investigators, forensic experts, psychologists, doctors and independent prosecutors with unlimited resources.",false,"Politics Conspiracy Theories, brett kavanaugh, clinton body bags, clinton body count"
865,24485,You don't know if this (the H1N1 vaccine) is gonna cause neurological damage like it did in the 1970s.,"October 14, 2009","Glenn Beck warns that in 1970s, flu shots caused neurological problems",Robert Farley,"Radio and talk show host Glenn Beck has said he doesn't want to share his personal take on whether he will immunize his family with the H1N1 vaccine — the stakes are too high either way to give a personal opinion, he says — but he and some of his guests have repeatedly raised concerns about the safety of the vaccine. On his radio show on Oct. 8, Beck said, ""You don't know if this (the H1N1 vaccine) is gonna cause neurological damage like it did in the 1970s."" Beck refers here to a concern often raised by vaccine opponents, so we decided to give the claim some scrutiny. It is rooted in a 1976 swine flu outbreak at Fort Dix in New Jersey, which resulted in the death of a U.S. soldier. President Gerald Ford initiated a massive immunization effort that resulted in some 45 million Americans getting a swine flu vaccine. The flu never went beyond Fort Dix, and the immunization program was halted, but among those who got the vaccine, more than 500 people got a rare neurological illness called Guillain-Barre Syndrome, an auto-immune disease that affects the nervous system and can cause paralysis. Two dozen people died from it. Understandably, many Americans grew wary of flu vaccines, particularly since the swine flu never materialized outside Fort Dix. But was the flu vaccine really responsible for all those people developing Guillain-Barre? In 2003, the Institute for Medicine commissioned a medical panel, called the Immunization Safety Review Committee,  to look into it. The issue is complicated by the fact that Guillain-Barre can be triggered by all kinds of influenza. So how much was the vaccine to blame? The panel  concluded  that ""the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relationship"" between the 1976 swine flu vaccine and Guillain-Barre in adults. However, the panel concluded that in the nearly 30 years of administering the seasonal flu vaccine since then, there was no proof that the vaccines had caused any more cases of Guillain-Barre, or any other neurological diseases, for that matter. ""The evidence was at most weak that the vaccine could act in humans in ways that could lead to these neurological problems,"" the panel concluded. So what about the risk of the H1N1 vaccine now? Doctors say the track record of seasonal flu vaccines shows the new one is safe. ""The vaccine was made essentially the same way vaccines have been made for the last 30 years,"" said Dr. Marie C. McCormick, a Harvard University professor who chaired that 2003 committee. Concerns about neurological issues with the H1N1 vaccine ""are not based on the evidence we have at hand today,"" McCormick said. In addition to studies conducted by the five pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the H1N1 vaccine, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has conducted clinical trials on more than 4,000 people, and the only side effects recorded so far amount to little more than sore arms and stuffed-up noses. Still, that's a relatively small sample, too small to ferret out any possible connection to Guillain-Barre, which in 1976 was recorded in just 1 in every 100,000 people who got the vaccine. There's no denying that the swine flu vaccine in 1976 appeared to contribute to an outbreak of Guillain-Barre, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. But to raise that specter without talking about the ensuing 30 years needlessly stokes fears, he said. Since that 1976 experience, Osterholm said, the seasonal flu vaccine has been administered to 100 million to 250 million people a year worldwide, and there's been no evidence it caused anyone to get Guillain-Barre or any other neurological disorder. ""At this point, we have no reason to believe it will,"" Osterholm said. ""This vaccine was made essentially the same way we made the seasonal flu vaccines for more than 20 years. You have to put it into context."" Put it this way, he said: His 31-year-old daughter is 6 months pregnant and works with children, and he is eager for her to get the vaccine. ""That's about as objective as I can get,"" he said. Patricia Quinlisk, medical director of the Iowa Department of Public Health, said the only difference between the H1N1 vaccine and the regular seasonal flu shot is that it targets a different viral strain. In fact, had H1N1 showed up earlier, she said, it would have been included in the seasonal flu vaccine package. But by the time it appeared in May, the seasonal flu vaccine was already being made. Quinlisk also cautioned not to put much stock in the fact that the 1976 vaccine targeted swine flu, and the H1N1 has often been called the swine flu. The H1N1 is actually combination virus, mixing the typical swine flu with avian flu and typical human influenza. Can scientists give a 100 percent guarantee that no one getting the H1N1 vaccine will develop neurological problems? No, she said. There haven't been enough trials to definitively rule that out. ""But do I think it's safer to get the vaccine than to risk getting the flu? Yes,"" she said. ""If the H1N1 vaccine becomes available to me, I'm going to take it."" That risk-reward ratio is markedly different than in 1976, she said. Then, the flu never spread beyond Fort Dix. ""The H1N1 is here,"" she said. ""It's a pandemic."" We should also note that taking the H1N1 vaccine is being encouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, both of which say the track record of seasonal flu vaccines over more than two decades suggest the H1N1 vaccine will be safe and effective. Beck is correct in that scientists say that in 1976, the swine flu vaccine likely caused Guillain-Barre in a very small number of adults. But Beck's statement lacks important context. The 30-year track record of seasonal flu vaccines strongly suggests the new H1N1 vaccine won't cause neurological damage. Without noting that the H1N1 vaccine has been manufactured in essentially the same way as the seasonal flu shot that has been used by hundreds of millions of people — without any established link to neurological problems — ends up misleading by omission. And so we rule Beck's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

868,24490,"The Baucus health care bill would require taxes on medical devices such as X-ray machines, female condoms, HIV tests and surgical needles.","October 9, 2009",Conservative blogger says proposed tax could hit wide array of medical devices,Louis Jacobson,"Republicans often complain that the Democratic health care bills would impose a heavy tax burden on Americans. So when the Senate Finance Committee began considering a tax on medical devices — including some modest devices such as enema kits and breast pumps — it was no surprise that conservatives would use the tax to rally opposition. Initially, the Finance panel was planning to subject all medical devices to the tax. (Technically this would be a tax on companies that make devices, based on their market share, rather than an excise tax on individual units.) But an outcry that it would lead to ""tampon taxes"" and ""Q-tip taxes"" led the committee's chairman, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., to shift course. He decided to apply the tax rules based on the three medical device categories determined by the Food and Drug Administration. These categories align roughly with how complex and risky the devices are. When the bill was unveiled on Sept. 16, 2009, Baucus said it would exempt items labeled Class I by the FDA, things such as enema kits and elastic bandages. Those items, which account for 47 percent of all devices, are often inexpensive and are defined as ""present(ing) minimal potential for harm to the user"" by the FDA. But critics continued to argue that including all Class II devices — which rank between Class I and III in complexity and risk — would still mean imposing a tax on a host of inexpensive items that could ultimately be passed on to consumers. So Sept. 22, 2009, Baucus exempted from the tax all Class II items costing less than $100. (Class III items — the 10 percent that ""sustain or support life, are implanted, or present potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury"" — have always been subject to Baucus' proposed tax.) This eased the attacks somewhat, but not entirely. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., offered an amendment to eliminate the tax altogether, but on Oct. 1, 2009, it failed by a 10-13 vote. Then, on Oct. 7, 2009, blogger Meredith Jessup on the conservative Web site TownHall.com cited work by a  Washington Times  columnist to show a wide range of items that she said would still be taxed despite Baucus' revision.   "" Washington Times  columnist Amanda Carpenter has looked into the matter and found that new moms who want to use a powered breast pump to bottle milk for their babies will have to pay this excise tax,"" Jessup wrote. ""These pumping devices, Carpenter points out, typically retail for more than $100. In addition, other items used by both men and women — including 'pacemakers, ventilators, X-ray machines, powered wheelchairs and surgical needles — will be taxed too.' ... So what else is on this list of items to be taxed? Lots of things, including dentures, fetal cell-screening kits, female condoms (I'm surprised there aren't angry 'feminists' taking to the streets over this one), tests for syphilis and HIV, hip, knee, ankle and breast prosthetics, dialysis catheters, mammograms and sickle-cell anemia tests."" We found many other conservative bloggers have made similar claims. We turned to the FDA's Web site to determine which items would be subject to the tax. We found that the following items would still be subject to the current version of the proposed tax, either because they're rated Class III or because they're considered Class II and cost more than $100: powered breast pumps; tests for HIV; pacemakers; ventilators; X-ray machines; powered wheelchairs; hip, knee, ankle and breast prosthetics; and dentures. Many dialysis catheters are rated Class III, and the female condom is Class III. (Male condoms are Class II — go figure.) Assuming Jessup meant ""mammography machines"" rather than ""mammograms,"" then you can add that to the list as well. It's a bit more complicated to determine the taxability of the remaining four that Jessup mentioned. Tests for sickle-cell anemia and syphilis are both categorized as Class II, and a Web search turned up prices well below $100 per test, suggesting that both would be exempt. Meanwhile, most surgical needles are rated Class I or Class II, and the one fetal-cell screening kit rated by the FDA is considered Class II; for both the needles and the fetal-cell kit, we were unable to find price quotes on the Internet. Based on this information alone, these products would seem likely to avoid the tax. However, congressional aides said that the final details about what's covered and not covered remain to be written. One possibility is that all Class II items that are generally sold directly to hospitals or doctors' offices, rather than to consumers directly, could be subject to the tax, even if they cost less than $100. Most likely, the Treasury Department would be responsible for providing final guidance — perhaps even a list of specific items — on which items fall into which category. So it's possible the four items above could eventually be hit by the tax. So Jessup is correct about most of the items she cites: They would be subject to the tax. A few others she cites would not fall under the committee's latest definition for the tax, but the practical details of the bill right now are not yet settled, so it's possible that they will be taxed eventually. We should also add that the tax may not necessarily be included in the final health care bill that will be crafted from the various versions in different committees. But for now, the provision remains part of the Senate Finance bill.",true,"National, Health Care, Taxes, Bloggers, "

The second video uses an even lazier (but equally deceptive) trick. Instead of showing the viewer an unopened can of BANG before swapping it out with a second can, this clip starts with a can that was already opened before the camera even started rolling.

870,22383,There is a growing body of evidence that radiation in excess of what the government says are the minimum amounts you should be exposed to are actually good for you and reduce cases of cancer.,"March 22, 2011","Ann Coulter says exposure to low levels of radiation is good for you, reduces cancer risk",Robert Farley,"As news broke last week that Japan's nuclear disaster may result in low levels of radiation wafting all the way to the U.S., political pundit Ann Coulter wrote a column arguing that too much is made of exposure to low levels of radiation. In an appearance on Fox's O'Reilly Factor on March 17, Coulter argued some exposure to radiation may actually be good for you. ""There is a growing body of evidence that radiation in excess of what the government says are the minimum amounts you should be exposed to are actually good for you and reduce cases of cancer,"" Coulter said. Before you go sticking your head in the X-ray machine, a little perspective is in order here. While there are scientists who subscribe to the theory that low levels of radiation can have beneficial health effects -- it's called hormesis -- it is still an outside-the-mainstream opinion. ""There is not a shred of evidence that radiation is good for you,"" said Eric Hall, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University in New York City. As for hormesis, Hall said, ""No one in the mainstream believes it."" Said Fred Mettler, a radiation expert at the University of New Mexico: ""Ms. Coulter -- who I find very enjoyable -- might be better sticking to political opinions."" Mettler, the U.S. representative for the United Nations committee on the health effects of radiation, pointed us to a chapter on hormesis from his book, Medical Effects of Ionizing Radiation. In the book, Mettler calls hormesis ""a concept that is controversial at best."" ""Early studies in the United States seemed to suggest a hormetic effect, or at least there were areas of higher radiation background that had lower cancer incidence,"" Mettler wrote. In particular, Mettler cited the work of T. D. Luckey, professor emeritus at the University of Missouri, Columbia, School of Medicine, who argued in multiple studies that evidence shows ""a significant decrease in cancer mortality rates of lightly exposed humans."" Mettler cautioned not to read too much into such studies, however. ""In addition to variability in populations, statistical uncertainties, potential bias factors, and chance, on one hand there will be instances in which there was less effect than predicted,"" he wrote. ""This is all understandable without invoking a unifying hypothesis of hormesis."" Owen Hoffman, a radiation-risk expert at Senes Oak Ridge Inc., a center for risk analysis, said that studies show low levels of radiation might eliminate some cancer but initiate others. ""Certainly radiation kills cells and can stimulate immune responses,"" Hoffman said. ""Thus it is possible for precursors of cancers, which are produced in the absence of above-background radiation exposure, might be eliminated through the processes of cell killing and immune response activation. But radiation exposures, even at background levels, can also initiate, promote new cancers and accelerate the manifestation of cancers that would occur in later life in the absence of exposure."" Hoffman also pointed to the work of Dr. Charles Land of the National Cancer Institute, who ""has shown in several of his recent publications that there is considerable uncertainty in the estimation of radiation risk. In his work, he does not give much credibility to the possibility that radiation induces a protective or beneficial effect. On the other hand, he concludes that even if some credibility could be given to the possibility of a threshold or beneficial effect of radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates, the biological and epidemiological evidence that new cancers may be initiated or promoted by radiation exposure cannot be completely ruled out."" ""At present,"" Hoffman said, ""carefully conducted epidemiological evidence does not support the presence of such beneficial effects in human populations that have been carefully monitored and followed up over time."" In her blog post, Coulter cited the work of Bernard L. Cohen, a physics professor at the University of Pittsburgh, who ""compared radon exposure and lung cancer rates in 1,729 counties covering 90 percent of the U.S. population. His study in the 1990s found far fewer cases of lung cancer in those counties with the highest amounts of radon -- a correlation that could not be explained by smoking rates."" We e-mailed Cohen and asked him about Coulter's statement. ""Word for word, what she says is correct,"" Cohen responded. ""It could go further and say that no other confounding factors (like socioeconomics, geography, etc., 500 were explored) can explain the results. However, my study was designed to test the assumption that the danger of radiation is simply proportional to the radiation dose, which is the only evidence that low-level radiation may be harmful. My conclusion was that that assumption is false. ""Whether low-level radiation is protective against cancer, a theory called hormesis, is debated in the scientific community,"" Cohen said. ""There is evidence on both sides."" So where does this leave us? We are not rating whether hormesis -- or as Coulter put it, the theory that exposure to low levels of radiation is actually good for you and reduces cases of cancer -- is correct. Reputable scientists disagree about that. We're rating whether Coulter was correct in saying there is ""a growing body of evidence"" that radiation in excess of approved exposure levels may be beneficial. There is a small but growing body of research to back up those claims. But the fact is that the mainstream of the scientific community has not embraced the theory. They point to limitations of those studies and argue the research falls well short of scientific evidence. Coulter failed to present this counter-weight, the opinion shared by the majority in the scientific community, which doesn't buy into -- and in many cases outright rejects -- the idea that low levels of radiation can have beneficial health effects and reduce the risk of cancer.",false,"National, Nuclear, Pundits, Science, Ann Coulter, "
872,9532,Allergy treatments enter a new era — with a focus on stopping reactions before they start,"December 2, 2016","The headline on this story from STAT promises to highlight a “new era” in allergy treatment built around the idea of preventing histamine and other immunologic explosions in our bodies’ mast cells and basophils before they start. What it delivers is something less–updates on efforts at immunologic therapies that are way short of popping up at the pharmacy anytime soon–and more: an eye-opening look at how Big Pharma and Big Science are investing Big Money in a potentially huge worldwide market for treatments that probably won’t do much better than antihistamines, epinephrine and allergen-avoidance. Parents curious about these forthcoming treatments–including very pricey immunotherapies–are likely already wondering if they’ll be affordable, yet the story skirts any discussion of pricing. But readers who stick with the piece to the end will learn something about the intentions and operations of the medical/pharmaceutical industrial complex, and that’s a good thing. Stories that describe new allergy treatments are likely to have mass audiences, including parents who are hopeful they can ease their child’s severe food allergies. But will any of these treatments pan out, and one day be widely available and/or affordable to the masses? It’s too early to say, and the story may raise some false hopes for not reining in some of the excitement with more about the realities of drug development.","Joann Rodgers, MS,Alan Schroeder, MD,Joy Victory","Although the story cites the hundreds of millions of dollars of investment made by drug companies and research institutions, it doesn’t address the potential costs of some newly developed commercial products, including one in stage 3 clinical trials that (literally) encapsulates bits of peanut protein designed to offer desensitization to peanut allergy. The approach has long depended on what the article calls the “home brews” of food allergy “concoctions” and injections that have been compounded and prescribed by allergists for decades. Nor does it mention the cost of a biologic made by Genentech that already is on the market for a form of asthma and is likely much more expensive than antihistamines and even the notorious Epi-Pens that would compete for an expanded market. The story also mentions Xolair, but does not mention the cost of this drug, which is quite prohibitive. Although the article finally does get to the point that biologics, immunologics, and quicker ways to achieve desensitization may not — for many patients — work better than golden oldies like antihistamines, the story could have, but didn’t, make any attempt to pin down what kinds of patients and how many of them might need or want the newer drugs, which are at best mostly years from being available. Particularly for the new-style food-desensitization therapies under development, the article explains potential (and even deadly) risks associated with them and it alludes to some of the downsides of immunotherapies (“allergy shots,” for instance) that can take months or years to work. But it says essentially nothing about the potential or actual adverse effects of a DNA vaccine under development, noting only that it “hypothetically decreases the risk for adverse events.” The article does a fairly good job of describing some of the hypotheses involved in the development of new or updated treatments, but it doesn’t offer enough information about the research underway. For example, we’re given no information about the status of the research on using the immunotherapy drug Xolair for food allergies combined with allergy desensitization therapy. No mongering: the prevalence of allergies is high and, according to some sources, rising rapidly in the developing world as well as in the U.S. The article casts a pretty wide net of sources, including interviews with allergy researchers at Stanford and at Mass General Hospital in Boston, as well as investigators with drug companies. There is acknowledgment of the possibility that the new treatments may not work any better than older ones for many patients. The story would have been stronger if it had done more head-to-head comparisons of effectiveness. The article, admirably, makes clear that movement through the new drug pipeline is likely to be slow for most of the newly envisioned therapies. The article makes clear that the some of the proposed “new era” treatment are actually old wine in new bottles–commercial versions of things allergists have been hand-tailoring to their patients for years. And it does examine some novel twists in describing the development of a DNA vaccine, and the expanded use of a relatively new “biologic” drug that exploits the immune system’s weaknesses and strengths. However, it could have been stronger at pointing out that nothing here is really brand new. The article was certainly not based on a single news release.",true,allergies

REUTERS/Alexander Natruskin But half a century after his exploit captured the world’s imagination and fueled a space race with the United States, Russia has found it necessary to release top secret archives to counter persistent rumors that Gagarin was later murdered on the orders of jealous or paranoid Soviet rulers. “Gagarin once said: ‘To me my whole life seems to be one perfect moment,’” recalled veteran Soviet space journalist Vladimir Gubarev earlier this month. The 27-year-old’s single Earth orbit on April 12, 1961 was one of the Soviet Union’s most enduring Cold War victories and is proudly remembered today, especially in the cosmonaut town that is the heart of the nation’s space program. Star City, the world’s oldest space-flight training center, resembles in many ways a shrine to the first man in space, whose premature death in a mysterious plane crash seven years after his flight cemented a poster-boy status. Visitors on a rare open day were greeted by a lone statue of Gagarin dominating the snowy paths between worn buildings scattered behind a perimeter fence in a pine forest outside Moscow like some isolated university campus. A mural of the national hero leads into a small museum hall filled with memorabilia: Gagarin’s orange-brown space suit, gifts from foreign dignitaries and a room that painstakingly re-creates his office as it was on the day he died. One striking photo shows Gagarin’s round orbiter, scorched from its fiery descent, lying in a field in Russia’s central Saratov region, where he was famously offered milk and bread by an astonished farmworker moments after landing. Conspiracy theories abound that he did not die in a plane crash, but was murdered on the orders of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev for an unspecified offence or disloyalty to the party. In an apparent bid to quash such whisperings about Gagarin’s death ahead of the anniversary, the archives declassified by post-Soviet Russia last week shed new light on the crash. The documents show a Soviet probe concluded that Gagarin had most likely lost control of his jet after swerving sharply to avoid a weather-forecasting balloon, archives official Alexander Stepanov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying. Gagarin’s maiden orbit nearly ended in disaster. “For 10 whole minutes of his flight, he thought he was dead,” said Gubarev, who knew Gagarin as a young fighter pilot. “The flight was absolutely heroic. It was unimaginably difficult. People thought a man might go crazy in space,” he told Reuters. When Gagarin’s Vostok-1 capsule hit the atmosphere on re-entry, the cables hooking the descent module to the service module failed to separate. The craft shook violently before they burned loose and Gagarin was sucked down by gravity. He experienced G-forces — the force of gravity on a body — two to three times steeper than those felt by today’s astronauts. “When I dream now, it is mostly nightmares about the descent,” said veteran cosmonaut Georgy Grechko, 79, who worked as an engineer on Gagarin’s space capsule. “When the craft re-enters the thick levels of the Earth’s atmosphere, it burns. The flames tear at the craft. It rolls and the coating melts. It’s scary.”   A letter Gagarin drafted to be sent to his family in case he died was among the documents declassified last week, and offered a glimpse into the steely-eyed courage of the young pilot. “I trust the hardware completely. It will not fail. But it can happen that a man trips at ground level and breaks his neck. Some accident may happen,” the letter previewed by opposition paper Novaya Gazeta said. “If it does... do not waste yourself with grief. Life is life, and nobody is safe from being run over by a car.”   The 19 candidates selected for the Vostok-1 flight were all test pilots, unafraid of speed, and slight enough in build to fit into the tiny 2m-wide (6ft) capsule. The Soviet-era charm of Gagarin’s humble roots may have favored him over others, including his backup Gherman Titov. Born in the village of Klushino, some 150 km (95 miles) west of Moscow, his father was a carpenter and his mother a milkmaid. The family was forced to live in a tiny mud hut when the village was burned down during the German occupation in World War Two. “Yura (Gagarin) was a very quick learner. He assimilated everything new. His mind was stellar,” Gubarev said. Gagarin sung Soviet hymns during the last checks, strapped atop the 30m-high (98 ft) rocket that would blast him into space from the long-secret Baikonur cosmodrome on the Kazakh steppe. “Poyekhali! (Let’s go! ),” he cried, in a phrase that has become synonymous with Gagarin in Russia. “The most emotional moment was when we heard he was walking and waving; his arms and legs were whole. We understood in one sigh that our five to six years of hard work had paid off and we had achieved something huge,” Grechko said. The United States responded 10 months later, when John Glenn made the first U.S. orbital flight.",true,Science News
875,997,"Eroding trust in vaccines leaves populations vulnerable, global study finds.","June 19, 2019","Trust in vaccines - one of the world’s most effective and widely-used medical products - is highest in poorer countries but weaker in wealthier ones where skepticism has allowed outbreaks of diseases such as measles to persist, a global study found on Wednesday.",Kate Kelland,"France has the least confidence of any country in the world in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, with a third believing that vaccines are unsafe, according to the study. While most parents do choose to vaccinate their children, varying levels of confidence expose vulnerabilities in some countries to potential disease outbreaks, the study’s authors said, recommending that scientists need to ensure people have access to robust information from those they trust. Public health experts and the World Health Organization (WHO) say vaccines save up to 3 million lives every year worldwide, and decades of research evidence consistently shows they are safe and effective. But to achieve “herd immunity” to protect whole populations, immunization coverage rates must generally be above 90% or 95%, and vaccine mistrust can quickly reduce that protection. “Over the last century, vaccines have made many devastating infectious diseases a distant memory,” said Charlie Weller,  head of vaccines at the Wellcome Trust health charity, which co-led the Wellcome Global Monitor study. “It is reassuring that almost all parents worldwide are vaccinating their children. However, there are pockets of lower confidence in vaccines across the world.”  The spread of measles, including in major outbreaks in the United States, the Philippines and Ukraine, is just one of the health risks linked to lower confidence in vaccines. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, false rumors about polio vaccines being part of a Western plot have in recent years hampered global efforts to wipe out the crippling disease. The study, led by Wellcome and polling company Gallup, covered 140,000 people from more than 140 countries. It found 6% of parents worldwide - equivalent to 188 million - say their children are unvaccinated. The highest totals were in China at 9%, Austria at 8% and Japan at 7%. Seth Berkley, chief executive of the not-for-profit GAVI vaccine alliance, said the report showed a “worrying number of people” questioning vaccine safety. But by focusing on the “vocal minority” who refused to vaccinate, it was easy to forget that the vast majority trusted vaccines and the science that underpinned them. The study also found that three-quarters of the world’s people trust doctors and nurses more than anyone else for health advice, and that in most parts of the world, more education and greater trust in health systems, governments and scientists is a also sign of higher vaccine confidence. In some high-income regions, however, confidence is weaker. Only 72% of people in North America and 73% in Northern Europe agree that vaccines are safe. In Eastern Europe it is just 50%. Heidi Larson, director of the vaccine confidence project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, worked with researchers on this study. She said it “exposes the paradox of Europe” which, despite being a region with among the highest income and education levels, also has the world’s highest levels of vaccine skepticism. In poorer regions, trust levels tend to be much higher, with 95% in South Asia and 92% in Eastern Africa feeling confident that vaccines are safe and effective.",true,Health News
876,1972,Study finds Americans are eating more - and more often.,"June 29, 2011","Americans may be cutting back on super-sized meals, but waistlines continue to expand from more frequent eating, according to a study released on Wednesday.",Ned Barnett,"People line up to buy food at a fast food restaurant in Harlem in New York December 16, 2009. REUTERS/Finbarr O'Reilly The number of daily meals and snacks consumed by U.S. adults rose to 4.8 in 2006 from 3.8 in 1977, according to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill researchers who examined surveys of daily eating habits over a 30-year period. In the top 10 percent of those surveyed, the number of daily meals and snacks rose to seven from five. The analysis also found that although the size of meal portions has stabilized in recent years, but the number of total calories consumed is rising. By 2006, the end of the period studied, Americans were consuming 570 more calories per day than they did in the late 1970s. A chief culprit behind the calorie gain: Americans now consume 220 more calories daily from sugar-sweetened soft drinks than they did in the 1960s, the study found. The study is thought to be the first to examine the combined contribution of changes in portion sizes, the caloric level of foods, and eating frequency on people’s total calorie consumption. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, and the findings appear in the June 2011 issue of the journal PLoS Medicine. Kiyah Duffey, a postdoctoral fellow at the UNC Interdisciplinary Obesity Center and one of the study’s authors, said large portion sizes drove the rise in calories during the early part of the study period. “Around the time people became aware of the portion sizes, we see a decline in the portion sizes they are consuming,” Duffey told Reuters. “It really seems that in the last couple of decades, it is the number of eating occasions that is driving this change.”   A proliferation of food availability and a decline in regular mealtimes may be fueling the pattern, Duffey said. “People aren’t sitting down to three meals anymore,” she said. “We sort of think about eating all through the day.”   Some sources of dieting and health advice say frequent eating in small doses revs up the metabolism and controls hunger, and is a healthier way of eating than three big meals. Duffey said what matters is what and how much you eat over the course of the day rather than how often you eat. “Don’t eat seven times a day if what you’re eating is a salty snack or a pizza,” she said. “If you’re going to do that, reach for an apple instead.”",true,Health News
878,7690,"Flood waters rise, eight killed as Florence dumps 'epic' rain on Carolinas.","September 15, 2018","Tropical Storm Florence dumped “epic” amounts of rain on North and South Carolina as it trudged inland on Saturday, knocking out power and causing at least eight deaths as flood waters that have devastated many communities kept rising.",Anna Mehler Paperny,"Florence’s intensity has diminished since it roared ashore along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast on Friday as a hurricane. But its slow march over the two states, crawling west at only 3 miles per hour (6 km per hour), is expected to leave large parts of the region deluged in the coming days, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said late Saturday. “This system is unloading epic amounts of rainfall, in some places measured in feet and not inches,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news briefing. His state has already endured record rainfall, with much more forecast to come. Rivers will continue to rise days after the rain has stopped, he said. “This is a hurricane event followed by a flood event,” said South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. With flood waters advancing rapidly in many communities, around 50 stranded people had been airlifted out by helicopter in North Carolina, said Petty Officer Michael Himes of the U.S. Coast Guard. More than 26,000 hunkered down in shelters. Numerous roads were closed, and authorities warned of the risk of landslides, tornadoes and flash floods, with dams and bridges in peril as rivers and creeks swelled. As of Saturday, about 676,000 homes and businesses were without power in North Carolina, along with 119,000 in South Carolina. North Carolina officials said there had been at least seven storm-related fatalities in the state, with unconfirmed reports of a further three deaths. South Carolina authorities reported one death. The White House said President Donald Trump approved making federal funding available in some affected counties. Trump, who plans a visit to the region next week, tweeted his “deepest sympathies and warmth” to the families and friends of those who had lost their lives. (GRAPHIC: Hurricane Florence to pummel U.S. Southeast for days - tmsnrt.rs/2oZFKSb)  At 2300 EDT (0300 GMT), the NHC said Florence had maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour (65 km), and was slowly drifting westward over South Carolina. The center said the storm would dump as much as 40 inches (102 cm) of rain along coastal areas of the Carolinas, as well as up to 10 inches in southwestern Virginia. In Fayetteville, a North Carolina city of about 210,000 people about 90 miles inland, authorities told thousands of residents near the Cape Fear River and Little River to get out of their homes by Sunday afternoon because of the flood risk. “If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible,” Mayor Mitch Colvin said at a news conference. “The worst is yet to come,” he added. The storm made landfall on Friday near Wilmington, a city of about 120,000 squeezed between North Carolina’s Atlantic coastline and the Cape Fear River. On Saturday, its streets were strewn with downed tree limbs and carpeted with leaves and other debris. Electricity remained out for much of the city, known for its historic mansions, with power lines lying across roads like wet strands of spaghetti. Near the Sutton Power Plant in Wilmington, coal ash leaked from a Duke Energy landfill. The site lost enough material to fill around two-thirds of an Olympic-sized pool, the company said in a statement, adding that it did not believe the incident posed a risk to health or the environment. Officials had warned before the storm that the rains could risk tainting waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste. Florence has already set a North Carolina record for rainfall totals, exceeding that of Hurricane Floyd, which struck  in 1999 and caused 56 deaths. Floyd produced 24 inches of rain in some parts of the state, while Florence has already dumped about 30 inches in areas around Swansboro. In New Bern, about 90 miles northeast of Wilmington at the confluence of two rivers, Florence overwhelmed the town of 30,000 and left the downtown area under water. Some area residents described a harrowing retreat as the storm hit. “It was pitch black and I was just scared out of my mind,” said Tracy Singleton, who with her family later drove through torrential rain and high winds from her home near New Bern. South Carolina authorities said law enforcement officers were guarding against looting in evacuated areas, while Wilmington set a curfew on Saturday evening in response to looting in one area. As the United States dealt with Florence, a strong typhoon tore across the northern tip of the Philippines, wrecking homes and triggering landslides before heading toward Hong Kong and China.",true,Environment
879,27868,"Soupy Sales was once suspended for asking his young television viewers to send him ""little green pieces of paper"" taken from their parents' wallets.","March 20, 2001","Perhaps someone should have been more concerned with the gullibility of parents, not children.",David Mikkelson,"It may be hard to imagine for those who have grown up in the modern era of radio and television with its “shock jocks” and numerous programs involving hosts playing all sorts of bizarre (and sometimes outright cruel) pranks on unsuspecting participants, but back in 1965 an off-the-cuff joke by children’s television host Soupy Sales touched off a huge scandal over what would today seem like little more than a harmless prank: Examples: [Sivulka, 1998] In January 1965 on his morning children’s show, the performer Soupy Sales suggested to his young viewers that they find the wallets of their sleeping fathers and take out “some of those funny green pieces of paper with all those nice pictures of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Alexander Hamilton, and send them along to your old pal, Soupy, care of WNEW, New York.” [Collected on the Internet, 1997] “Hey kids, last night was New Year’s Eve, and your mother and dad were out having a great time. They are probably still sleeping and what I want you to do is tiptoe in their bedroom and go in your mom’s pocketbook and your dad’s pants, which are probably on the floor. You’ll see a lot of green pieces of paper with pictures of guys in beards. Put them in an envelope and send them to me at Soupy Sales, Channel 5, New York, New York. And you know what I’m going to send you? A post card from Puerto Rico!” The controversy began on Friday, 1 January 1965, when Soupy Sales — who was somewhat miffed at having to work on New Year’s Day — had a few minutes to kill at the end of his program. Ad-libbing, Sales looked into the camera and delivered a request to his young viewers to sneak some “little green pieces of paper” (i.e., currency) out of their parents’ wallets and send them to him. (The show was aired live and no tape of it exists, so a verbatim transcription of what Sales actually said is not available.) Complaints from outraged parents came fast and furious, and the television station that hosted Sales’ program, WNEW-TV in New York, had pulled him off the air by the following Monday. (Contrary to common belief, Sales wasn’t fired over the stunt, nor was his show canceled because of it: He resumed broadcasting two weeks later, and his program ran on WNEW for almost another two years.) It’s easy for those who weren’t around back then to be puzzled by the frenzied response to what now seems like a tepid, impulsive gag at worst, but back in 1965 plenty of adults were livid at the thought of a TV personality’s crassly manipulating children for commercial gain. As many of Sales’ supporters maintained, though, Soupy hadn’t really done anything that radio and television pitchmen hadn’t already been doing for years: he had simply cut out the middleman by suggesting that children send him money directly rather than exhorting them to buy his sponsors’ products. Hadn’t his radio predecessors been just as commercially manipulative when they continually touted the charms of various mediocre products to children, who then pestered their mothers to buy those products solely because the purchases were necessary to obtain a Shake-Up Mug or Code-O-Graph or whatever geegaw was being plugged on popular kids’ shows like Little Orphan Annie and Captain Midnight? If cooler heads had prevailed back in 1965, adults might have realized that the furor was much ado about nothing. The premise of Soupy’s stunt was largely untenable, because it required that children mostly too young to understand or appreciate the concept of “money” would nonetheless be able to recognize it, surreptitiously remove it from their parents’ wallets, put it in envelopes with the correct postage and address (even though Soupy hadn’t provided an address), and mail it to him, all without their parents’ knowledge or assistance. At that age I’d have been hard-pressed to successfully mail a postcard to myself without help, and no kid I knew who was mature to enough understand the value of money was about to part with any prized currency by sending it to a TV host who promised nothing in return, no matter how nicely he asked. Nonetheless, decades later sloppy historians were still reporting that “It worked. According to reports it was ‘the biggest heist since the Brink’s robbery. '”1 It didn’t work. Although various accounts credit Soupy with having received up to $80,000 through the mail, Sales himself has revealed on numerous occasions that he netted only a few real dollars, along with a lot of play money, green Monopoly money, and other forms of fake currency: The most famous single gag comes on New Year’s Day 1965. Mr. Sales tells kids to go into their parents’ wallets and to send him “those little green pieces of paper.”It’s become a cult thing to say you sent $10, $20, he says, but if that had been true, he would have had enough money to buy the building. He received only a few dollars, and a week’s suspension. 2",true,"Entertainment, Radio & TV, Television"
884,10980,Immunotherapy reduces cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis,"July 13, 2016","This news release asserts that a study found that combining two biologic drugs which contain extra-low doses of antibodies against tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) and interferon (IFN) can “improve the efficacy of standard rheumatoid arthritis therapy and decrease cardiovascular risk.” But the accuracy of that statement depends on what your definition of “cardiovascular risk” is. If your definition includes the risk of heart attacks and strokes (as it surely does for most people), then the statement is questionable at best. The release does not mention any of those outcomes and instead focuses on “unstable angina, severe hypertensive crisis, and deterioration of chronic heart failure.” The news release is rich in mechanistic details, ie: how the treatments’ processes may help reduce markers of cardiovascular risk, but poor in important details of interest such as potential harms, costs and impacts on heart attacks or strokes. Granted, it was a small study, but it would have benefited from appropriate caveats around the actual outcomes observed, the potential for harms, and an overall sense of context. [Editor’s note: The European Society of Cardiology, which issued the release, has appeared on HealthNewsReview.org’s Wall of Shame twice before (see here and here) and this release comes close to meriting a repeat appearance.] In rheumatoid arthritis cytokines, a type of proteibn such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN), start to attack healthy cells. If low-dose anti-TNF or anti-IFN drugs could reduce the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis as well as decrease cardiovascular risk they may make a huge contribution to rheumatoid arthritis sufferers. If many people with rheumatoid arthritis also have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease it is useful to study if biologic drugs can reduce those risks by slowing down or halting the disease process.","Alan Cassels,Dan Mayer, MD,Kathlyn Stone","No mention of costs, whatsoever. This may be a lost learning opportunity because these drugs are not only very expensive, but are also at the ends of their patent lives and hence generic companies are making cheaper biosimilars. The release offers some quantification of benefits when it describes the “incidence of cardiovascular events (unstable angina, severe hypertensive crisis, and deterioration of chronic heart failure)” as being 37% in conventional disease-modifying drugs group compared to those who also took anticytokines (at 13%). Normally, that quantification would earn the release a satisfactory rating but the definition provided here for “cardiovascular risk” does not include heart attacks and strokes. It’s misleading to leave them out. No mention of harms, and there are known rare, but serious, adverse effects associated with all of the biologic drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. What the study description needed was a caveat saying that a 68-person trial might be preliminary, or interesting, or even hopeful, but certainly not definitive. In addition, the release doesn’t mention how the outcomes were measured and if the study was blinded on the part of either the patient or the research observer. No obvious disease mongering here. We would caution that whenever a drug study encourages physicians to prescribe the drug more often, particularly in patients with mild disease, it could be construed by some observers as disease mongering. We learn that Professor Aida Babaeva, the lead investigator, is the head of the Department of Internal Medicine, Volgograd State Medical University, Volgograd, Russia, but not the degree to which she may have connections to companies making these drugs. Those kind of clarifications are important. There are a range of alternatives (statins, antihypertensives, anticoagulants) that can help reduce cardiovascular risk in patients but none of these alternatives are mentioned in the context of the study. Even one line acknowledging the existence of these alternatives would have rendered this a much more satisfactory release. It can be safely assumed that the biologics mentioned in the study are on the market, but are the “extra-low dose combination of two anticytokines” readily available? We’re not sure. This might be worth the benefit of the doubt. The news release does not misrepresent the novelty of the approach and the lead investigator asserts that not all rheumatoid arthritis patients should be using this combination, saying “In patients with highly active disease, the standard biologics are better at preventing severe complications such as progressive joint destruction and/or systemic manifestations (vasculitis, uveitis, involvement of internal organs).”  It appears that the use of the “extra low” doses are simply a novel use of standard drugs, possibly in patients who would never have used the drugs in the past. There are no obvious examples of the use of unjustifiable descriptors. However, the first paragraph seems to suggest that it is well-known that these drugs will reduce rheumatoid and cardiovascular disease. The implication is that these have been well-proven, but we think that’s still an open question.",false,"Association/Society news release,cardiovascular disease"

Many tweets and Facebook posts are making the  claim that there is a trend of disease outbreaks matched to elections. ""Every election year has a disease,"" reads one. The posts connect SARS to 2004, avian flu to 2008, swine flu to 2010, MERS to 2012, Ebola to 2014 and 2018, Zika to 2016, and the coronavirus to 2020. ""Coincidences? NEVER."" One post we saw supposedly linked to the World Health Organization (WHO), but that lead to a 404 error page. Our research showed that most of these connections weren’t real. We decided to take a closer look and see if the diseases were significant enough to appear in party platforms or mentioned during candidate interviews. In most cases, they weren’t. Online, fact-based news is going to be very important in the coming weeks. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today. SARS is a coronavirus disease that spread from animals to humans and was diagnosed in China in 2003. SARS is a respiratory illness that affects breathing and is usually associated with coughing and a fever. It is spread through infected droplets that can survive on surfaces and could affect you if airborne. The SARS outbreak was stopped by July 2003, and in 2004 China took precautions by putting an embargo on animals that could have been the source of the disease. SARS affected eight people in the United States, and all these cases were contracted from travel abroad. SARS did not spread within the United States during the 2003 outbreak, and there have been no cases reported since then. SARS wasn’t a main campaign point in the 2004 presidential elections. It was referenced once in the Republican Party platform that was released in August 2004, under a section on international diplomacy that mentioned it as a joint concern of the United States and China. Avian flu is usually found in aquatic birds and poultry, but in rare cases the influenza can cross over and infect humans. The symptoms of avian flu are like general influenza, including cough, fever, sore throat or headaches. The two most prevalent avian influenza viruses, H5N1 and H9N2, caused respiratory infections in humans in China as early as the 1990s. Vietnam, Indonesia, China, Egypt, Thailand, and many other countries struggled with the spread of H5N1 from 2004 to 2014. In 2014, there was only one case of H5N1 in North America, according to the CDC, and there were never any U.S. cases. As far as the 2008 presidential campaign is concerned, the Democratic Party platform mentioned avian flu briefly to justify strengthening international support systems. Nevertheless, the avian flu was a pandemic before the 2008 presidential election and has continued to be a problem even today, with new strains appearing as recently as 2017. The 2008 strain of the influenza had no significant influence on elections that we could determine. The swine flu, more specifically H1N1, started spreading in early 2009 and combined avian, swine, and human influenza in one new strain. The symptoms of the disease are like most flu symptoms, including a fever, chills, cough, sore throat, or a runny or stuffy nose. It also spreads like most influenza, with infected droplets that could be airborne or left on surfaces. The 2009 swine flu outbreak was the ""first global flu pandemic in 40 years,"" according to the CDC. The panic surrounding swine flu led to many extreme measures, including school shutdowns and people camping outside of free swine flu vaccine centers. But not everyone approved of the vaccine. PolitiFact checked a statement from October 2009 by Glenn Beck, a conservative talk show host who was against the swine flu vaccination. He believed the vaccine would lead to neurological problems like that of an influenza vaccine from the 1970s. Swine flu was a politically polarizing disease when it came to vaccinating and expanding the government’s health budget to prevent more outbreaks. It affected Americans directly and led to preventative legislation, but we found no examples of representatives using H1N1 in their campaigns during the 2010 midterm elections. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, is a viral respiratory illness that was first found in dromedary (or one-humped) camels and then spread to humans. Most cases of the disease came from direct or in-direct contact with camels. Human-to-human transmission of MERS is more rare and mostly appears in unsanitary health care settings. Symptoms of the disease include fever, coughing, or trouble with breathing that can lead to pneumonia. MERS was first diagnosed in Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to the CDC. All cases of MERS in 2012 were within the Arabian Peninsula, with two unlinked cases only reaching the U.S. in 2014. MERS was not brought up by any campaigns or included in any party platforms in the 2012 presidential election. It didn’t affect the U.S. until 2014, and even then the only comment was from press secretary Jay Carney, when he said at a press conference that President Barack Obama had ""been briefed"" on the MERS developments. Even though MERS did occur during the 2012 election, it didn’t seem to have any effect on U.S. politics. The Ebola virus emerged periodically and caused outbreaks in many African countries as early as 1995. Ebola is introduced into the human population when there is close contact with the bodily fluids of infected fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines. Human-to-human transmission only occurs when touching infected human bodily fluids or objects that have touched infected human bodily fluids. The first signs of Ebola include fever, fatigue, or a sore throat. Later, the infected person will experience vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function. In the most deadly cases, there is internal and external bleeding. The first large outbreaks were in 1995 and 2000 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, according to the CDC’s timeline. The CDC also documented only four diagnosed Ebola cases in the U.S. in 2014, and only two of the Ebola patients were infected in the U.S. In 2018, there were only outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. In 2014, an NPR report broke down how Ebola was used by both Democrats and Republicans. Democrats would use Ebola to ""argue that budget-cutting Republicans have deprived the government of the resources it needs to keep Americans safe."" Republicans used the government’s reaction to Ebola as an example of President Obama’s ""incompetence"" and linked Ebola to border security. In contrast, Ebola was not a topic in the 2018 election because Ebola was only concentrated in two African countries and had a very low chance of coming to the U.S. again, according to the Association of Health Care Journalists. Ebola was not a huge threat to Americans in the United States despite some cases in 2014, but it was used as a political tool in the 2014 midterm elections. Comparatively, there were no cases of Ebola in 2018 in the United States, and it was not used as rhetoric in the elections. Zika is spread mostly through the bite of infected mosquitoes, but can also be transmitted through unprotected sex. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, headache, joint and muscle pain, and red eyes (conjunctivitis). While Zika has a low death rate, it became a larger issue when it was linked to fetal brain defects in infected pregnant women’s children. Outbreaks of the Zika virus have been reported in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands since 1952, according to the CDC. It began to appear more in the United States in 2015 and 2016 because of people travelling from tropical climates and from local mosquitos in Texas and Florida. In 2016, the Zika outbreak hit a peak, with 5,168 symptomatic Zika virus disease cases reported in the U.S., according to the CDC’s 2016 report. Zika sowed division in an already divided Senate but didn’t impact the presidential race. President Obama’s administration asked Congress ""for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funding to enhance… efforts to prepare for and respond to the Zika virus"" in February 2016. It took almost seven months for Congress to approve a federal spending bill to prevent the Zika virus from spreading. The New York Times reported that they voted to advance the funding, despite disagreements between Republicans and Democrats on where the funding should come from. A month later, the bill had fallen apart, with the Democrats rejecting provisions added by the Republicans. Finally, the bill passed on Sept. 28, 2016, with concessions made by both sides. During this congressional tug of war, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both brought up the Zika virus only once during their campaigns. When Trump was asked about how he would deal with the Zika virus while he campaigned in Florida, he said that Rick Scott, the state’s Republican governor, was doing a great job and ""he's going to have it under control, he probably already does."" Clinton urged Congress to pass a spending bill and ""called for more public education about the virus’ dangers, the development of a rapid diagnostic test, investment in treatment and a vaccine, better mosquito control and abatement, and improved access to health and family planning services."" While the Zika virus had an impact on Americans in 2016 and showed how divided the Senate was, we found little impact on the 2016 presidential election. The 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or COVID-19, is a respiratory disease that has symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. It is spread by airborne respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person coughs or sneezes and can also be spread by touching surfaces that droplets have landed on. Like it says in the name, COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has spread across the world as people traveled to and from China. There are now 647 cases in the U.S. as of March 10, 2020. As COVID-19 has spread in the United States, Congress and President Donald Trump have approved funding to create a vaccine and prevent a pandemic. On March 6, 2020, Trump signed an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill. This time, the virus has been a major point of discussion for the president and other presidential candidates. A post on social media says ""Every election year has a disease"" ... SARS in 2004; avian flu in 2008; swine flu in 2010; MERS in 2012; Ebola in 2014 and 2018; Zika in 2016 and the coronavirus in 2020. But most of these diseases were discovered and spread before the election years. Some of the diseases never impacted the United States, and never came up as a large point in a campaign. There is some evidence that Ebola in 2014 impacted the election, but otherwise there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics. The post is not accurate.

888,25422,A ham and cheese sandwich on one slice of bread is the responsibility of the USDA ... But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration.,"December 10, 2007",A legitimate beef with ham sandwich regulations,Bill Adair,"In a speech in Shenandoah, Iowa, Clinton made a campaign issue out of a ham and cheese sandwich. She said the federal government ""is not taking the steps necessary to protect us"" because of inadequate inspections of toys and food. She cited this example: ""A ham and cheese sandwich on one slice of bread is the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which inspects manufacturers daily. But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration, which inspects manufacturers about once every five years."" To find out if her sandwich example was correct, we turned to government reports on food safety, interviewed the head of the USDA's food inspection service and studied the government's Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book, a fascinating manual that provides rules for Wiener schnitzel (""a veal cutlet prepared by dipping in egg, flour and bread crumbs, and frying to a golden brown"") and vinegar pickle (""sausage in vinegar pickle is approved with the understanding that sausage is completely covered with pickle and that the pickle has a pH level not higher than 4.5""). The manual also spells out which foods are under USDA jurisdiction. We found that Clinton is correct about the regulation of sandwiches and the big disparity in inspections by the two agencies. In an interview with PolitiFact last week, Richard Raymond, the USDA's undersecretary for food safety, acknowledged that the sandwich rule is silly. ""There is no rationale or logic that I can explain to anybody,"" he said. ""It defies logic."" He said the rules don't affect the safety of the nation's food supply, but said, ""it's an issue that makes it look like we don't know what we're doing."" Raymond didn't know the origin of the sandwich rule, but others suggested that the volume of meat might have been the key factor in whether it was FDA or USDA jurisdiction. (The rule only applies to plants that assemble sandwiches for retail stores like 7-Elevens. Sandwiches made-to-order at a deli or a Subway store are not subject to the inspections, Raymond said.) To understand the strange bureaucratic turf of food inspections, you have to go back to the 1906 publication of Upton Sinclair's novel  The Jungle  , which described horrific conditions at meat plants. That book, still required reading in many high school English classes, had such impact that it persuaded Congress and President Theodore Roosevelt to enact a law requiring meat inspections. Roosevelt had called for a law that would require oversight ""from the hoof to the can."" Since then, the government has put considerable emphasis on meat and poultry, which fall under the USDA. The agency's 7,500 inspectors and veterinarians conduct continuous daily inspections of the nation's meat and poultry plants. The law requires USDA inspections before the products can be sold. But other foods have not gotten the same scrutiny. Most are regulated by the FDA, but the law does not mandate inspection frequencies, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. The report confirms that Clinton is correct that, on average, the FDA inspects the 57,000 food plants under its jurisdiction about once every five years. ""There is no rhyme or reason to how we regulate food today in the U.S.,"" said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ""It's based on antiquated laws and bifurcated agencies. The current food safety system doesn't protect the public."" Without a mandate for regular inspections, the FDA hasn't gotten enough money to do them more frequently. Smith Dewaal said the agency is ""really starving for resources."" Her complaints are echoed in a new report from an FDA advisory panel. The November 2007 report for the agency's Science Board said the FDA is so overburdened and underfunded that it can't effectively conduct routine surveillance. ""The nation's food supply is at risk,"" the report said. And so we find that Sen. Clinton has a legitimate beef on ham and cheese. We find her claim to be .",true,"National, Consumer Safety, Regulation, Hillary Clinton, "
889,9415,"Sleep apnea patient finds rest with implant device: ""It saved my life","January 24, 2018","Inspire Therapy implant The story focuses on one patient’s experience with a technology called Inspire, which is an implantable device used to treat one particular form of sleep apnea (obstructive). While sleep apnea is a common problem in the United States, the story does little to place the work in context. Instead, the story cites a medical professional who calls it “revolutionary” and a “game-changer” without telling readers that the doctor is a consultant for Inspire. There is also no objective medical assessment of the device’s effectiveness, as the medical professional quoted is also the treating physician. It’s also not clear why the story came out now, given that Inspire has been on the market for a few years and that the evidence cited is from 2014. We are happy for any patient who has found relief for a medical problem. But the treatment that works for one patient may not work or even be appropriate for others. It is important for any story about medical treatments to offer detailed information about the costs, risks and benefits of a treatment, rather than relying on one person’s story. This is true for any treatment, but especially for medical devices, which are not tightly regulated by the FDA. This story focuses on one person, but tells readers that Inspire “is offering hope for millions of patients with sleep apnea.” The story should let readers know whether that hope is justified, and also provide clarification regarding its potential benefit applies only to individuals with obstructive sleep apnea.","Matt Shipman,Clarissa Diamantidis, MD, MHS,Joy Victory","Here’s what the story says in regard to cost: “The device costs around $20,000 not including the surgery.” This doesn’t adequately address two key points. The first problem here is that an invasive surgery, such as this one, could be extremely expensive. Does it require the patient to be put completely under by anesthesia? Is it out-patient surgery, or would patients have to spend at least one night in a hospital? Details like that can make a huge difference in terms of cost. The second, bigger problem is that the story doesn’t make clear that this is not a one-time cost. Inspire implants can malfunction, and the batteries in the implants will need to be replaced. For example, a 2010 study published in Sleep Medicine Reviews found that, out of eight patients, five experienced device malfunctions more than six months after implantation. There may have been improvements in the technology since that study was published, but there is still no acknowledgment that Inspire’s internal power supply would need to be replaced periodically — and neither the new battery nor the related medical procedure is likely to be free. Benefits are not quantified. Beyond one patient’s anecdotal experience, the story refers to a study that found “68 percent of patients experienced less sleep apnea after getting the implant.” How bad was the apnea before? How did the compare against a control group (if there was one)? But there is virtually no information about the study, the extent of the improvement, how long it lasted, etc. More detailed information is needed here. However, the biggest concern here is that the story doesn’t make sufficiently clear that Inspire is designed to address just one particular type of sleep apnea. It does say that Inspire is for “moderate to severe cases,” but that’s pretty vague — and doesn’t address the core problems here. First off, there are two large classes of sleep apnea: obstructive (in which the airway becomes blocked) and central (in which the brain doesn’t send the appropriate signals for normal breathing). Inspire can only address obstructive sleep apnea. What’s more, it can only address some types of obstructive sleep apnea. For example, Inspire’s website notes that “Inspire therapy is not intended for patients with a complete concentric collapse at the level of the soft palate.” What exactly does that mean? How common is that condition? I wish the story had told us. What’s more, Inspire’s website also notes that “Inspire therapy has not been clinically tested in patients with a body mass index greater than 32.” In other words, no one knows whether Inspire would work on one of the groups of people at greater risk of sleep apnea. There’s also this hyperbolic quote: “This has been revolutionary. It’s been a game changer,” Dr. Maurits Boon said. Considering the device doesn’t work for everyone, is expensive, invasive, and may cause side effects, it doesn’t seem revolutionary. The story notes that “like any surgery, there is risk of infection” when Inspire is implanted. That isn’t enough. A check of FDA’s MAUDE database reveals patient complaints of slurred speech, difficulty breathing, and the device suddenly activating itself, among other problems. In addition, there are questions particular to the use of an electrical device implanted in the chest — especially for a condition that is most common among patients who are “older, overweight and male” (as the story puts it). For example, can patients with pacemakers also use Inspire, or would they interfere with each other? Outside of one patient’s personal experiences, and a single, vague reference to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there is no discussion of evidence supporting benefits associated with Inspire. To be clear, we are not saying this evidence isn’t out there, we’re simply saying the story doesn’t tell us what that evidence is. The story only includes the perspective of one patient with very severe sleep apnea, but never clarifies how many people with sleep apnea have mild, moderate or severe sleep apnea. We’re left to assume it’s a whole heck of a lot of people, because the story says this new treatment “is offering hope for millions of patients.” This lack of clarity adds up to disease-mongering. The story cites only one expert source — and fails to tell readers that the source is a consultant for Inspire. In fairness, you won’t find that information on the doctor’s professional website. However, it is disclosed in a 2016 journal article by the doctor and one of his collaborators. If we could find that information (with a minimum of effort), we think its omission is a significant oversight. The story does tell readers that CPAP, a widely used treatment for sleep apnea, did not work for the patient being profiled. However, the story doesn’t let us know how often CPAP is ineffective, whether there is any difference in effectiveness between CPAP and Inspire for most patients, or what other treatment options are available. It is clear from the story that Inspire is available. This is a tough one. On the one hand, the story does clearly explain how the Inspire technology works — which is good. However, doesn’t state how this is different from any other treatment options — the only other option mentioned is CPAP. If Inspire takes a completely different approach from other treatment technologies, it’s important for the story to come right out and say so. The story doesn’t appear to rely on a news release. In fact, it’s not clear why the story is running now at all. Inspire was approved by the FDA in 2014 and has been on the market for quite some time.",false,"medical devices,sleep apnea"
890,2518,Your child's brain on math: Don't bother?.,"April 29, 2013","Parents whose children are struggling with math often view intense tutoring as the best way to help them master crucial skills, but a new study released on Monday suggests that for some kids even that is a lost cause.",Sharon Begley,"According to the research, the size of one key brain structure and the connections between it and other regions can help identify the 8- and 9-year olds who will hardly benefit from one-on-one math instruction. “We could predict how much a child learned from the tutoring based on measures of brain structure and connectivity,” said Vinod Menon, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine, who led the research. The study, published in the online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to use brain imaging to look for a connection between brain attributes and the ability to learn arithmetic. But despite its publication in a well-respected journal, the research immediately drew criticism. Jonathan Moreno, professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, fears that some parents and teachers might “give up now” on a math-challenged child. “If it gets into the popular consciousness that it’s wise to have your kid’s brain checked out” before making decisions about academic options, he said, “that raises huge issues.”  Menon and his fellow scientists agree that their research shouldn’t lead to hasty conclusions. They are exploring whether any interventions might change the brain in such a way that children who struggle with math can benefit more from tutoring. Just as learning to juggle increases the amount of gray matter in the area of adult brains that is responsible for spatial attention, said Menon, maybe something could pump up regions relevant to learning arithmetic before a child begins math tutoring. Until then, he said “it’s conceivable” that parents will interpret the new study as saying some kids cannot benefit from math tutoring, “and give up before even trying. How this plays out is far from clear.”  The study was conceived as a way to understand why some children benefit more than others from math instruction, said study co-author Lynn Fuchs, professor of special education at Vanderbilt University and an expert on ways to improve reading and math skills in students with learning disabilities. For the research, the scientists first ran several tests on 24 third-graders to measure their IQ, working memory and reading and math ability. The children also underwent brain imaging. Structural MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) revealed the size and shape of various regions, while functional MRIs revealed connections among them. Then the children received 22 one-on-one tutoring sessions, spread over eight weeks, for eight to nine hours per week. The tutoring emphasized number knowledge (principles like 5 + 4 = 4 + 5, and that many pairs of numbers add up to, say, 9) and fast-paced mental math (“quick, what is 6 + 9?”). After the tutoring, the children all improved in their arithmetic ability, solving more problems correctly and more quickly. But the amount of improvement varied enormously, from 8 percent to 198 percent. None of the measures - pre-tutoring IQ score, working memory and math skills - predicted how much a child would improve. But when the scientists compared each child’s improvement with his or her pre-tutoring brain images, two connections jumped out. The volume of gray matter (neurons) in the right hippocampus, one of the twin structures crucial for forming memories, varied by about 10 percent in the children, Stanford’s Menon said. The strength of the wiring between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia varied by about 15 percent. Both predicted how much a child’s math skills improved with tutoring, the scientists reported. The prefrontal cortex, behind the forehead, “is important for cognitive control, which plays a role in the formation of long-term memories,” Menon said. The basal ganglia, tucked under the brain’s outer surface, “is involved in habit formation and procedural memory,” such as how to add numbers. “Children with a larger right hippocampus and greater connectivity between the hippocampus and these two structures improved their arithmetic problem-solving skills more,” said Menon. These brain features explained 25 percent to 55 percent of the variation in improvement after math tutoring, he said. That, of course, leaves almost half of the difference among children to be explained by other factors. Among the concerns raised about the study is its size. It enrolled only two dozen children, on a par with many neuroimaging studies but quite small for research that might influence people’s behavior, said psychologist Scott Lilienfeld of Emory University. “This is very, very preliminary evidence that brain measurements might tell you something that psychological measurements don’t,” said Lilienfeld, co-author with psychiatrist Sally Satel of an upcoming book, “Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless Neuroscience,” that critiques some uses of neuroimaging. “It’s important to see if the findings hold up in a second sample, and if other labs corroborate this.”  Because brain images seem more rigorous than psychological measures, he said, there is a risk that parents and educators will interpret the study as definitive evidence that some children are doomed to be innumerate. “Caution has to be the watchword here,” he said.",true,Health News
894,35037,Children's radio host Uncle Don inadvertently uttered a shockingly derogatory remark about youngsters that was caught on an open mic.,"February 7, 2020","Narrator: One lesson an announcer learns is to make sure he is off the air before he makes any private comment. But even the greatest sometimes slip. A legend is, Uncle Don’s remark after he had closed his famous children’s program. Let’s turn back the clock.",David Mikkelson,"In the early days of Snopes.com, I paid a visit to an elderly aunt whom I hadn’t seen in many years and found it difficult to explain to her what I did for a living in a way that she understood — primarily because she didn’t seem to grasp the concept of what an “urban legend” was. I searched my memory for an example of an urban legend that she would recognize, and recalling the time and place where she grew up (i.e., the East Coast in the 1930s), I asked her, “Do you remember Uncle Don?” Her face immediately lit up. She started to say, “I was listening the day when …” My aunt didn’t need to finish that sentence for me to know what she was referring to, of course. Nor did she need to say anything more for me to know that she was about to regale me with her personal reminiscence of witnessing an event that never took place. The “Uncle Don” legend was the seminal cautionary tale of the mass communications era ushered in by the advent of broadcast radio, a technology that created the potential for an injudicious remark uttered in an unguarded moment to be heard in real time by thousands of persons geographically remote from the speaker — with potential career-ending consequences: The affable host of a radio show for children finished telling his last story of the day, wished a good night to all the youngsters in his audience, and sang his familiar sign-off ditty. As the station went to a commercial break, he leaned back in his chair, sighed, and said to no one in particular, “There, that oughta hold the little bastards!” Unfortunately for the ill-fated host, the engineer was late in cutting to the station break, and the host’s disparaging remark was picked up by the still-open microphone and broadcast into millions of homes. The station was immediately flooded with thousands of telegrams from outraged listeners, and the humiliated host was fired before the day was out, never to broadcast again. Disgraced beyond redemption, he lived out the rest of his life in obscurity and died, an impoverished drunk, several years later. Versions of this tale were familiar to many Americans in the mid-20th century, typically told by someone who claimed to have heard the infamous broadcast themselves, or who had an older friend or relative who did. At the very least, most everyone knew someone who recalled the national uproar caused by the incident or remembered reading about the firing of the hapless host in the newspaper. This legend seems to have been attributed, at one time or another, to virtually everyone who had ever hosted a show for youngsters on radio or television. Adults who grew up in America during the years of radio’s prominence between the world wars tended to name whichever local children’s host they listened to or were most familiar with as the culprit. Those who grew up after television became a fixture in American households were more likely to identify one of the many ubiquitous kiddie TV personalities as the guilty party. In one of his popular books of urban legends, folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand provided a prime example of this phenomenon. After devoting a few pages on the legend to letters debunking the notion that this incident took place on a “Bozo the Clown” television show, Brunvand offered his own recollections: “To tell the truth, I always thought that the host of my own favorite kids’ radio show, ‘Happy Hank’ (heard in Lansing, Michigan, mid-1940s), had spoken these naughty words into a live mike.” Despite the wide variety of radio and television hosts with whom this legend has been associated, over the years one name has been connected with the alleged incident more often and more prominently than any other: Don Carney, known to millions of pre-television youngsters as “Uncle Don.” As broadcast radio rapidly gained in popularity during the early 1920s, commercial stations began creating programming specifically for children, leading to the rise of numerous radio “uncles,” “aunts,” and “brothers,” hosts who related stories and songs and acted out skits with regular characters they invented for a largely preschool audience. These shows typically aired in the hours after school, on Saturday mornings, and in the early weekday evenings. By far the longest-lived and most well known of these children’s hosts was “Uncle Don” Carney of station WOR, whose show aired throughout a seven-state area including metropolitan New York six days a week for 21 years. Don Carney, born Howard Rice in 1897, hailed from St. Joseph, Michigan. He left home to join the circus as an acrobat and ended up in vaudeville, where, at age 15, he began using the stage name of Don Carney while performing stock Irishman parts. He traveled throughout the Midwest, performing in various stock and repertory companies before gaining minor notoriety as a trick pianist who could play while standing on his head. After bouncing from job to job and state to state, Carney eventually made his way to New York, where he obtained employment at radio stations WMCA and WOR, working as an announcer, vocal handyman, and stand-by pianist. When a toy manufacturer came to WOR one day looking for a children’s show to sponsor, Carney was tapped to audition for them. The routine he threw together in a few hours impressed the sponsors, and Don Carney soon embarked upon a new career as the beloved kiddie host “Uncle Don.” His children’s show made its debut in September 1928 and ran for nearly two decades (until February 1947), airing six nights a week Monday through Saturday. (At various times Carney also read the funnies to his audience of youngsters on Sunday mornings.) Uncle Don’s program was a combination of original stories and songs, jokes, advice, personal messages, birthday announcements, and club news, woven around numerous commercial messages. Even before we begin a discussion of any potential factual basis for this legend, we can already determine that the repercussion aspect of the legend — the claim that Uncle Don was fired (and, in some versions, replaced with a sound-alike) in response to his alleged careless remark — is clearly false. Don Carney broadcast day in and day out, six and sometimes seven days a week, starting in 1928 and ending only when he finally stepped down from daily broadcasting in 1947. (Even then, he continued on with WOR as a DJ devoted to playing children’s records before moving to Miami Beach in 1948 and hosting a weekly children’s show on WKAT until his death in 1954.) His show was never canceled, and he was never taken off the air or relieved of his job for any period, until his daily spot was finally discontinued by WOR in 1947. Don Carney was never penalized for anything he said as an on-air radio personality. We also note that not a single contemporaneous account of Don Carney’s supposed involvement in a “bastard” scandal appeared in any major news or trade publication of the day. The only articles linking the name of Uncle Don to this tale did not report it as current or recent news, but rather recounted the incident in the latter years of his career as an occurrence that had purportedly taken place at some indeterminate time in the past (a typical pattern for print accounts of apocryphal events). In fact, we know that this Uncle Don “bastards” rumor is false, and we know exactly how it became associated with Don Carney. It was an extant legend told about a number of different children’s show “uncles” and “big brothers” in the early days of broadcast radio, and — in true urban legend fashion — when Uncle Don eventually became the most famous exemplar of that form of radio host, the story gravitated to, and became permanently attached to, him. We know this because in May 1928, several months before Don Carney debuted as “Uncle Don,” the very same story appeared on the front page of the Los Angeles Examiner, related in a first-person account by a “radio station Big Brother” identified only as “J.K.”:  And within a few years (April 1930), the very same story was published in the entertainment industry trade publication Variety, once again attributed to a unidentified children’s radio host who was clearly not Uncle Don. (Carney broadcast out of New York and not Philadelphia.) Readers at the time would have assumed the announcer referenced here was most likely Christopher Graham, known in Philadelphia as Uncle WIP: His Error! A wisecracking radio announcer in a Philadelphia station lost his job about two weeks ago as a result of a stern reprimand of the station by the Federal Radio Commission. Announcer had concluded a bed-time story for children and thought the power was off. For the benefit of the control room he added: ‘I hope that pleases the little b______.’ This went out over the air. Within 10 minutes several telegrams of protest, among them [some from] the Federal Radio Commission, had arrived. Others came later in bundles. Note the many aspects of implausibility to this item. It bears a curious lack of detail for a news report of an event that supposedly happened only “two weeks ago”: no specific host was named, no particular radio station was identified, and no date was provided, even though the incident was supposedly quite recent. Moreover, it posits that telegrams of protest allegedly started arriving at the radio station “within 10 minutes,” as if the show’s listeners (including members of the Federal Radio Commission, who apparently had the facilities and staff to monitor every single program on the air) lived within yards of a telegraph office and had nothing better to do that evening than pop out the door and dash off telegrams of complaint. Unfortunately, once the “little bastards” rumor was attached to Don Carney, it clung there tenaciously for the rest of his life (and beyond), reinforced by manifestly false accounts which supposedly documented something that never took place. For example, the following narrative appeared in Sidney Skolsky’s syndicated entertainment column “Hollywood Is My Beat” on July 24, 1957: “I’ve just run across your reference to Uncle Don’s classic blooper on radio and your bid for the exact story from a reader, who had some connection with the incident,” writes Oliver M. Sayler. It was back in the winter of 1928-29. The station was WOR. I was in the fifth year of my weekly book and play review, “Footlight and Lamplight.” One of Uncle Don’s, programs for children immediately preceded my time on the air. I had no contact with it except, when occasionally, other studios were occupied and I was asked to broadcast in the studio he had used. On this particular occasion, I was to follow Uncle Don on the spot, and I was standing by in his studio, waiting for the late Floyd Neal to sign him off, give the station break and introduce me. Uncle Don twittered his usual cheery wind-up, and then, not realizing that I was to follow on the same microphone, and thinking he was off the air, blurted out: “There, I hope that’ll hold the little b_______.” Well, he wasn’t off the air! The nation-wide reaction to his blunt statement raised a furor that impaired his celebrated program. Only after a 10-year atonement and the spending of a fortune on his part to conduct a children’s entertainment concession at the N.Y. World’s Fair in 1939, did he manage to return fully to radio’s good graces. But he never again achieved his former vogue. On the surface, this would appear to be a fairly credible account of the incident in question. It comes from someone purportedly in the broadcasting business, working at the same station as Uncle Don, and it describes a fairly specific time and place of occurrence (even if it does rely upon the amazingly fortuitous circumstance of the claimant’s just happening to be in precisely the right spot, at just the right time, to witness the event). However, this account leaves us puzzled as to how a “nation-wide reaction” could have taken place yet remain unreported in any major newspaper, magazine, or trade publication of the time. Where, then, did this national reaction play out? Moreover, a check of the radio listings in The New York Times from the winter of 1928-29 reveals that Oliver Sayler’s “Footlight and Lamplight” radio program didn’t, as he claimed, follow Uncle Don’s show, but preceded it. (“Footlight and Lamplight” aired after the news at 6:15 p.m.; Uncle Don was on the air from 6:30 to 6:55 p.m.) How, then, did Sayler come to be in the studio at the conclusion of Uncle Don’s program, as he claimed he was? Despite the occasional attempts to perpetuate it in newspaper columns, this rumor might have significantly declined in prevalence after Don Carney’s death (or at least been less frequently associated with his name) were it not for a series of popular “Blooper” records that rekindled public awareness of the legend. Starting the mid-1950s, writer and producer Kermit Schafer began compiling several albums of alleged boners, fluffs, and outtakes from radio and TV and issuing them in record jackets deceptively claiming that the recordings contained within were “authentic.” Although the “Bloopers” records led listeners to believe that they were hearing actual recordings of broadcast blunders, much of what Schafer presented actually consisted of fabricated “re-creations” based on (often apocryphal) secondhand sources. In this vein, Vol. 1 of the “Blooper” series presented Uncle Don front and center, in a clip of impossible clarity and audio fidelity which had clearly been staged in a modern recording studio:",false,Entertainment
895,7723,"Over 20 dead in U.S. polar vortex, frostbite amputations feared.","January 31, 2019",Tens of millions of Americans braved Arctic-like temperatures on Thursday as low as minus 56 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 49 Celsius) that paralyzed the U.S. Midwest and were blamed for at least 21 deaths.,Jonathan Allen,"Warmer-than-normal weather was on the way, but that offered little comfort to vulnerable populations such as the homeless and elderly enduring cold that caused frostbite in minutes and made being outside potentially deadly. Officials across multiple states linked numerous deaths to the frigid air. The death toll rose from a previous 12 after at least nine more people in Chicago were reported to have died from cold-related injuries, according to Stathis Poulakidas, a doctor at the city’s John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital. Poulakidas, a trauma specialist, said the hospital had seen about 25 frostbite victims this week. He said the most severe cases risked having fingers and toes amputated. Among those believed to have died from the cold was  University of Iowa student Gerard Belz. The eighteen-year-old was found unresponsive on campus early Wednesday morning just a short walk from his dorm, according to university officials. Police told a local television station they believed the cold played a factor in his death. The wind chill at the time officers found Belz was minus 51 F (minus 46 C), according to the National Weather Service. Homeless and displaced people were particularly at risk, with Chicago and other cities setting up warming shelters. But many toughed it out in camps or vacant buildings. A 60-year-old woman found dead in an abandoned house in Lorain, Ohio, was believed to have died of hypothermia, Lorain County Coroner Stephen Evans said. “There’s just no way if you’re not near a heat source that you can survive for very long out in weather like this,” Evans told the Chronicle-Telegram newspaper. It has been more than 20 years since a similar blast of frigid air covered a swath of the U.S. Midwest and Northeast, according to the National Weather Service. The bitter cold was caused by the mass of air known as the polar vortex drifting south from its usual position over the North Pole. Homes and businesses used record amounts of natural gas to fight the cold, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. Utilities appealed to consumers to conserve energy to avoid power outages. In Detroit, General Motors Co suspended operations at 11 Michigan plants to cut natural gas consumption. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV canceled a shift on Thursday at two of its plants. Snow and ice created treacherous travel conditions, with 26 road collisions reported within two hours on Thursday in eastern Iowa’s Johnson County, emergency communications center chief Tom Jones told the Iowa City Press-Citizen. For the second day in a row, the intense cold and windy conditions forced U.S. airlines to cancel more than 2,000 flights. Chicago was hardest hit, with O’Hare International Airport experiencing over 700 cancellations, according to the FlightAware tracking site.

The backlog has been cut from more than 20,000 cases to 12,700. That’s after Harris’ office spent $15 million of $24 million allocated by the Legislature and governor. Some continue to argue that the cases should be cleared more quickly, citing the mass shootings that have continued across the country. But there’s no denying that the Attorney General’s Office, under Harris, has put a dent in the backlog, allowing for the seizure of thousands of guns. And that’s far from ""nothing."" While there’s room to criticize the pace of the program, Sanchez’s statement amounts to a complete misrepresentation of reality.",Chris Nichols,"Critics have repeatedly attacked California Attorney General Kamala Harris for what they say is her slow progress investigating gun owners who are legally prohibited from having them. In 2001, California created the nation’s only database to identify these gun owners, including the mentally ill and those subject to domestic violence restraining orders. It allows the seizure of weapons by law enforcement from people in the prohibited categories. There’s no record of anyone questioning the existence of the database, which has been praised by gun control advocates. But a decade after it went into effect, the tracking system has a backlog of thousands of cases. Enter Rep. Loretta Sanchez. The Orange County congresswoman is Harris’ closest competitor for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer. All three are Democrats. Sanchez told Capital Public Radio during an interview in January 2016 that Harris has squandered state resources, and hasn’t even produced a database. ""So the Legislature gave the Attorney General $25 million to match up those people who were felons versus those people who were buying guns. Just a database, so that we could weed out what was going on with respect to those people who shouldn’t be able to purchase guns – by existing law. Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don’t have that database,"" Sanchez said. We decided to focus on whether the database exists, and check on how the state funds have been spent. #ICYMI: See & hear the words that put @LorettaSanchez on the hot seat. #PantsOnFire: https://t.co/HEY8WGisUz pic.twitter.com/pBIkGNvYHd  Our research The database is officially called the Armed Prohibited Persons System, or APPS. It was created in 2001 after the Legislature passed SB 950, a Republican-authored bill, in response to gun violence across the nation. It cross-references all handgun and assault weapon owners in California against criminal records. It’s designed to check for individuals who legally purchased or registered a firearm but later committed a crime that would prevent them from owning the gun. Law enforcement agents are charged with tracking down the individuals and trying to confiscate their weapons. The database became active in December 2006, according to Harris’ office, or four years before she was elected attorney general. In this Nov. 16, 2012 Associated Press file photo, California Attorney General Kamala Harris speaks during a news conference in Los Angeles. While the database is not public, it is real. It’s been tied to a court challenge and is the subject of reports by the Attorney General’s Office, articles by the press, and letters by gun rights groups and gun control advocates. ""Yes. It does exist,"" said Michelle Gregory, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General’s Office. ""These (enforcement) agents are working these cases every day. … It’s definitely a lot of work. It’s time consuming."" ""The database absolutely exists,"" added Mike McLively, an attorney with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. We asked the Sanchez campaign to explain her claim. A campaign spokesman argued that it’s correct — if you add words that greatly change the original statement: ""To date, we don’t have that database as it was promised by the (State) Department of Justice in 2013,"" the spokesman wrote in an email. As a refresher, here’s what Sanchez said originally: ""Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don’t have that database."" Still a backlog? It’s a clear misstatement to say ""we don’t have that database."" But we wanted to see what progress Harris has made reducing its backlog, to better examine Sanchez’s claim that ""nothing was done"" and that ""$25 million was spent."" In 2013, the Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown approved $24 million in additional funds to reduce the long list of cases. It had grown to more than 20,700 at the time, according to Harris’ office. Earlier that year, a Harris aide seemed to suggest that the backlog could be eliminated in a single year, according to news reports from the time. That same year, the attorney general pledged to hire 36 enforcement agents with the money. Two years later, only half as many had been hired  due to what Harris’ office called ""hiring challenges."" And while state investigations helped clear nearly 7,000 names off the list, the overall backlog had shrunk by only one-fifth during that time, to about 17,500, according to a March 2015 report by the Attorney General’s office. A sample of the firearms seized through the state's APPS program. Photo courtesy California Attorney General's Office. Republicans in the Legislature criticized Harris for what they said was slow progress. Sanchez’s comments about the database came five days before the Attorney General’s Office issued another report on the program. It said the list is now down to about 12,700 cases, which the office called ""a historic low."" The report makes clear that the list is not static. More than 20,000 people were added to it during the past two and a half years, while about 7,800 dropped off due to death or other reasons.

Scott Walker signed Act 92.","January 14, 2013","Hundreds of Afghans, weary of war and unsure of the future, have joined a letter-writing campaign to share their feelings with the powerful few who will decide on peace with the Taliban and, with it, the fate of their country.",Dave Umhoefer,"The letters from different parts of Afghanistan express a tangled mix of confusion, resignation and fear. “I live in grief but I smile. People think I am brave but I have no choice,” wrote one unidentified person. The letters, part of a project called Dard-e-Dil (a painful heart) are addressed to U.S. diplomats, the Taliban and government officials. They are being written as high-level talks are underway to find a political settlement to end a war that has raged on for 18 years. “I am writing with a hope that we have a better life in Kabul, we live amidst so much tension, I can do nothing to change the situation but I am still writing,” wrote another person from the Afghan capital. The Dard-e-Dil project aims to give ordinary people an outlet to express their feelings at a time when the peace talks among top officials dominate politics, even though the fighting has not subsided. “The prevailing political uncertainty is clearly the most nerve-racking phase for Afghans, most of us are already battling depression and mental health issues,” said artist Omaid Sharifi, who organized the project. Sharifi’s interest in expressing the feelings aroused by the conflict goes back to his work with ArtLords, an art collective he co-founded that has become famous for the dramatic murals it has painted on grim concrete blast walls around Kabul. His team has installed special letter boxes outside cafes, educational centers, hospitals and government offices, encouraging people to try to deal with their anxieties and voice their opinions about the peace talks in letters. The letters are sorted at the ArtLords studio with the aim of sending them on to government authorities, diplomats and the leaders of the insurgency. More important, though, is the need to help people tell their stories, a basic requirement for mental health, said Sharifi, who struggled with anxiety for years. “Everyone has a right to narrate their story. Some of these stories will highlight and reveal human rights abuses and some will offer hope and solidarity,” he said. Afghanistan has been devastated by decades of war, stretching back to the conflict with the former Soviet Union from late 1979. Violence, instability and poverty have touched virtually every family and many Afghans suffer from mental health problems. However, facilities for treating such illnesses are scarce. Wahid Mayar, a spokesman for the public health ministry, estimated that about half of the population will experience mental stress during their lifetime, a consequence of war often overshadowed by daily struggles. “The suffering of mental illness in Afghanistan is a silent war. If peace comes then we will have to accept the new normal, but currently we are in a phase of tremendous uncertainty,” Mayar said. “The prospect of peace brings hope and anxiety. We wonder can peace ever come to embrace us, to calm our minds,” he said. Accurate data on mental health is not available in Afghanistan but the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates more than a million Afghans suffer from depressive disorders and more than 1.2 million from anxiety disorders. The WHO says the actual numbers are likely much higher. Nobody expects the letter-writing campaign to heal the wounds of more than four decades of conflict but it may allow at least some people to start working through their fears and prepare for an uncertain future. “There are times when I want to run away from my country and then I think I should wait for peace and plan my life here,” wrote one person. “Kabul is always the best place to be.”",false,"Consumer Safety, Legal Issues, Wisconsin, Vince Megna, "
901,30001,The celebration of Christmas was illegal in the United States until 1836.,"December 18, 2018","For these reasons, the claim contained in the “For Truth Not Religion” meme is false.",Dan MacGuill,"The final weeks of every year see the “War on Christmas” return to television panel debates and newspaper columns in the United States, bringing (dubious) claims that modern American society has progressively marginalized and turned against public expressions of Christianity. In December 2018, one widely-shared internet meme turned this annual trope on its head, claiming that Christmas only came to be accepted relatively late on in the history of the United States, after a long period of Puritan disdain for what was once perceived as a “pagan holiday.” The Facebook page “For Truth Not Religion” posted a meme featuring blurred images of “publick notices” describing Christmas traditions as “Satanical practices,” along with the claim that “Christmas was illegal in the U.S. until 1836 as it was considered an ancient Pagan holiday”:  At one time, in both American and English history, Christmas was indeed regarded as a pagan holiday, but it’s not true to say that the festival was banned in the United States until 1836. Neither the meme itself nor “For Truth Not Religion” cited any sources, but the two archaic notices shown in the meme provided some clue as to the origins of the claim. The first was a law passed by the General Court in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1659, which read as follows:  Publick Notice For the preventing of disorders, arising in several places within this jurisdiction by reason of some still observing such festivals as were superstitiously kept in other communities, to the great dishonour of God and offense of others. It is therefore ordered by this court and the authority thereof that whosoever shall be found observing any such day as Christmas or the like — either by forbearing labour, feasting or any other way, upon any such account as aforesaid, every such person so offending shall pay for every such offense five shilling as a fine to the county. Massachusetts Bay Colony, 1659. The second notice read as follows:  Publick Notice The observation of Christmas having been deemed a sacrilege, the exchanging of Gifts and Greetings, dressing in Fine Clothing, Feasting and similar Satanical Practices are hereby FORBIDDEN with the Offender liable to a Fine of Five Shillings. The first notice came from a statute passed in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1659, which can be viewed here. The provenance of the second notice is unclear: the earliest instance of it we could find was a 1963 newspaper article that referred to the Atlantic Monthly magazine’s having republished it as part of a subscription renewal advertisement, describing the notice as a 1660 Massachusetts law. Despite this citation, it is not included in various online collections of Massachusetts colonial records, which, by contrast, do contain the first notice. It’s possible that the second notice did originate in Massachusetts in 1660 but was a public advertisement that summarized and reiterated the 1659 law, rather than being a discrete statute of its own. In any event, it is true that the celebration of Christmas was indeed banned in colonial Massachusetts in 1659. That ban was motivated largely by the austere Puritan religious beliefs of authorities in the colony, who objected to the December 25th celebration for two main reasons: because it was originally a pagan winter festival co-opted by Christians and lacking in any Biblical basis, and because it was typically accompanied by merriment and indulgence and therefore was anathema to the Puritan principles of sobriety and hard work. In his book The Battle for Christmas the historian Stephen Nissenbaum referenced the suppression of Christmas celebrations in early New England:  In New England, for the first two centuries of white settlement most people did not celebrate Christmas. In fact, the holiday was systematically suppressed by Puritans during the colonial period and largely ignored by their descendants … Only in the middle of the nineteenth century did Christmas gain legal recognition as an official public holiday in New England. Nissenbaum noted that the Puritans often pointed out the lack of explicit Biblical support for December 25 as Jesus’ birthday (an issue we have separately examined in greater depth) and emphasized its pagan origins as well as decrying the excess that often came with it: It involved behavior that most of us would find offensive and even shocking today — rowdy public displays of eating and drinking, the mockery of established authority, aggressive begging … and even the invasion of wealthy homes … Excess took many forms. Reveling could easily become rowdiness; lubricated by alcohol, making merry could edge into making trouble. Christmas was a season of “misrule,” a time when ordinary behavioral restraints could be violated with impunity. The Puritan crackdown on Christmas in Massachusetts had a recent precedent in English history. During the 1640s and 1650s, under the influence of Oliver Cromwell, England’s short-lived republican parliament passed laws restricting and prohibiting the celebration of Christmas. First in 1644, lawmakers passed an ordinance which called for December 25 to be a day of “solemn humiliation” rather than the “carnal and sensual delights” which had characterized the celebration of Christmas: This day in particular is to be kept with the more solemne humiliation, because it may call to remembrance our sinnes, and the sinnes of our forefathers, who have turned this Feast, pretending the memory of Christ into an extreame forgetfulnesse of him, by giving liberty to carnall and sensuall delights, being contrary to the life which Christ himselfe led here upon earth. In 1647, the English parliament banned the celebration of Christmas altogether, along with Easter and Whit Sunday, replacing them with a monthly day of rest: Forasmuch as the Feasts of the Nativity of Christ, Easter and Whitsuntide, and other Festivals commonly called Holy-Dayes, have been heretofore superstitiously used and observed Be it Ordained, by the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, That the said Feast of the Nativity of Christ, Easter and Whitsuntide, and all other Festival dayes, commonly called Holy-dayes, be no longer observed as Festivals or Holy-dayes within this Kingdome of England and Dominion of Wales … However, these crackdowns did not last long. When the English monarchy resumed under Charles II in 1660 (ushering in a period known as the Restoration), laws passed during the preceding 18 years were struck down, and Christmas has been legally and enthusiastically celebrated there ever since. Similarly, the Massachusetts Bay prohibition on Christmas was repealed in 1681, some 22 years after it was introduced. We were unable to find any record of a similar ban on the celebration of Christmas after that date, either in the north-eastern colonies of the 17th and 18th centuries, or anywhere throughout the United States after 1776. Indeed, the emphasis on religious liberty in the 1791 Bill of Rights, whose First Amendment famously bars states from creating any law “prohibiting the free exercise” of religion, means any attempt to outlaw the celebration of Christmas would have been given short shrift. The significance of 1836 appears to be as the year in which, it is widely held, Alabama became the first U.S. state to formally recognize Christmas Day as a public holiday. However, some dispute exists over this date. The earliest record we could find placing Alabama’s legal recognition of Christmas at 1836 was James Harwood Barnett’s 1954 book The American Christmas. However, despite searching news archives and Alabama legislative records, we were unable to verify that the state passed any statute or resolution in 1836 rendering Christmas Day a public holiday. In any event, the claim in the meme that Christmas was “illegal in the U.S. until 1836” is wrong in several ways. First, Christmas was only ever illegal from 1659 until 1681, and not thereafter. Secondly, that ban was limited to the Massachusetts Bay colony and never took hold throughout the United States, which was not even formed until almost a century after the Massachusetts ban had ended. Finally, 1836 was the year in which, according to some sources, the first U.S. state recognized Christmas Day as a public holiday. However, there is reason to doubt the accuracy of that date, and in any case, the series of laws passed throughout the United States in the 19th century had the effect of making December 25 a day off for laborers, not overturning a ban on Christmas Day.",false,"History, christmas, war on christmas"
902,22191,Leo Berman Says the hospital listed on Barack Obama’s just-publicized long-form birth certificate denies the president was born there.,"April 27, 2011",State Rep. Leo Berman says Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children denies President Barack Obama was born there,Meghan Ashford-Grooms,"Trying to quell recurrent unfounded claims that he wasn’t born in Hawaii, President Barack Obama released his long-form birth certificate Wednesday. In a White House news conference, the president said he was releasing the document in order to move on from the so-called ""birther"" issue: ""We have to make a series of very difficult decisions about how we invest in our future but also get a hold of the deficit and debt. But we're not going to be able to do it if we are distracted. We're not going to be able to do it if we just make stuff up and pretend that facts are not facts."" Nevertheless, Obama said, there will likely be ""a segment of people"" for whom the evidence of his birth certificate is not enough. Indeed, shortly after Obama spoke, state Rep. Leo Berman, R-Tyler, said he’s still not persuaded that Obama was born in a Honolulu hospital, according to the Texas Tribune. The Tribune reported that Berman, who has filed legislation to require presidential candidates who want to appear on the Texas ballot to present their birth certificate to the secretary of state, ""claims the hospital Obama lists on his birth certificate — in fact, all hospitals in Honolulu — have denied the president was born there."" We followed up with Berman, who told us that two hospitals, including Kapiolani Medical Center For Women and Children, where Obama says he was born, have denied it. He couldn’t recall the name of the other hospital. Asked where and when the hospitals made the denials, Berman told us: ""In several places over the past year and a half,"" but provided no more specifics. ""Neither hospital recognized the fact that he was born there and not only that, but you would think that the hospital that gave birth to the president of the United States would have some kind of commemorative plaque or something."" Berman also said that ""it’s going to take someone with a lot of money like Donald Trump to take a look at this and see if Kapiolani will admit whether or not he was born there."" Trump, a possible GOP presidential candidate, has repeatedly suggested that Obama was not born in the United States. Earlier this month, for example, he said Obama’s ""grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed his birth."" PolitiFact rated that statement False. Responding to a 2008 question about whether ""she was present when he was born in Kenya,"" Obama’s grandmother, who speaks Swahili, at first said through a translator that she was. Then she clearly and repeatedly corrected herself, saying that he was born in the United States. A subset of Obama critics, dubbed ""birthers,"" doubt that he is a natural-born U.S. citizen, a requirement to serve as president. PolitiFact has checked at least five other claims about Obama’s birthplace, finding no truth to any of them. One was a February claim by Berman, who said Hawaii’s governor ""can’t find anything that says (Obama) was born in Hawaii."" Finding no evidence that the governor said that. We searched the Lexis-Nexis database, which archives news articles, and the Internet, where skepticism about Obama’s proof of citizenship thrives, for assertions that Kapiolani hospital had ever denied that it was the site of Obama’s birth. We found no instances of hospital officials making that assertion. However, we found a Jan. 18 story by World Net Daily, a conservative news website that has fanned the birth certificate controversy, reporting that a former Honolulu elections official had said that Kapiolani hospital has no record that Obama was born there. Two days later, Hollywood reporter Mike Evans, claiming to be a longtime friend of Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie’s, told Minnesota’s KQRS-FM radio that the governor had told him that he had searched ""everywhere using his powers as governor"" at Kapiolani and Queen’s hospitals and that ""there is no Barack Obama birth certificate in Hawaii. Absolutely no proof at all that he was born in Hawaii."" However, FoxNews.com later quoted Evans as saying that he had misspoken. ""I haven’t talked to Neil since he’s been governor,"" he said. According to Fox, Evans said that he called Abercrombie’s office after reading online reports that the governor couldn’t find Obama’s birth certificate but Abercrombie did not return his call. Obama’s newly-released long-form birth certificate contradicts those reports — and Berman’s claim. The document says that Barack Hussein Obama II was born at Kapiolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital at 7:24 p.m. Aug. 4, 1961. We attempted to reach officials from the Kapiolani Medical Center for Woman and Children on Wednesday and didn’t hear back. But as FactCheck.org reported in its April 9 look at Trump’s claims, Kapiolani can’t legally release individually identifiable health information, which the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) prohibits. Individually identifiable health information, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is information relating to the provision of health care to an individual, or anything that can reasonably be used to identify the individual, such as a name, address, birth date or Social Security number. An individual’s health information can only be shared under certain circumstances, according to the site, such as reporting a gunshot wound to the police. Protected information includes information in an individual’s medical record, and health providers must comply with an individual’s right to decide whether or not health information can be shared for certain purposes. In July 2009, World Net Daily quoted Kristy Watanabe, a spokeswoman at Hawaii Pacific Health, which includes the Kapiolani hospital, as saying: ""Our comment to everyone who has been calling is that federal law does not permit us to provide any more details concerning information about Obama’s birth without authorization from Mr. Obama."" However, the medical center has promoted a January 2009 letter Obama wrote on White House stationery to congratulate the medical center on its centennial celebration. ""Kapiolani was one of Hawaii’s earliest hospitals, and it has served many generations of Hawaii’s people with distinction,"" the letter says. ""As a beneficiary of the excellence of Kapiolani Medical Center — the place of my birth — I am pleased to add my voice to your chorus of supporters."" The Foundations of Hawaii Pacific Health published the letter in the spring 2009 issue of its Inspire magazine, and the medical center posted video of Abercrombie reading Obama’s letter at the centennial dinner on its website. For CNN’s recent investigation into ""birther"" claims, which aired April 25-26, CNN reporter Gary Tuchman traveled to Hawaii to conduct numerous interviews, including one with Monika Danielson, who says she was in the hospital at the same time as Obama's mother and saw him in the nursery. He also interviewed Chiyome Fukino, who was the state Health Department's director under Republican Gov. Linda Lingle. The bottom line, according to Tuchman: His research ""reveals what most analysts have been saying since the 'birther' controversy erupted during the 2008 presidential campaign: Obama was born in Hawaii on Aug. 4, 1961. Period."" So far as we can tell, Kapiolani hasn’t confirmed that Obama was born there, citing federal privacy law that prevents it from doing so. But we found no record that the hospital has ever denied it, as Berman claims. Nor did the lawmaker provide evidence of such. We have a rating for such statements. !",false,"Obama Birth Certificate, Texas, Leo Berman, "

The Gates Foundation has pledged up to $60 million for COVID-19 vaccine development, not $100 million, as the post says. Some of that will go to a group that’s manufacturing a potential vaccine developed by NIAID scientists, but not the agency itself. While some studies have found that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could help alleviate coronavirus symptoms, other studies have found the drugs have no discernible effect.",Daniel Funke,"The country’s top infectious disease expert is discouraging the use of a potential COVID-19 treatment because he could earn millions of dollars from a vaccine, at least, that’s according to a popular Facebook claim. One post published by an anti-vaccine page on April 12 says Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), ""stands to lose 100 million dollars"" on a coronavirus vaccine from Bill Gates because he invested in it. ""If everyone can be healed with the Malaria drug and a Z pack, there will be no need for the vaccine if we could use drugs already on the market that helps heal 98 percent of the cornovirus (sic) patients,"" reads the image. ""That’s why he’s been so hesitant to put his seal of approval on this form of treatment that has shown to drastically improve hundreds of people’s symptoms."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) As a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, Fauci has tempered expectations for the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients. The drugs, which are used to treat conditions like malaria and lupus, respectively, have shown some promise in alleviating coronavirus symptoms, but the research is not conclusive. PolitiFact has seen a lot of misinformation about public officials’ financial interests in hydroxychloroquine. Fauci has become a popular target for coronavirus disinformation, so we wanted to check out this post, too. The Facebook post draws a  connection between Gates’ philanthropy and Fauci’s public remarks about hydroxychloroquine. There is no evidence that Fauci is personally financially invested in a coronavirus vaccine, and scientists still don’t know if hydroxychloroquine is effective in treating COVID-19. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is indirectly supporting the NIAID by funding a group that is helping the agency develop a potential coronavirus vaccine. But there is no evidence that Fauci himself stands to profit. The Gates Foundation said in a Feb. 5 statement that it is investing up to $100 million for ""the global response to the 2019 novel coronavirus."" That includes efforts aimed at improving detection and treatment of the virus in addition to vaccine development. ""The foundation will commit up to $60 million to accelerate the discovery, development and testing of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for 2019-nCoV (the formal name for the coronavirus),"" the statement reads. While the Gates Foundation has supported the NIAID in the past, the philanthropy told PolitiFact in an email that it does not provide funding to the agency now, even though NIAID is currently developing a COVID-19 vaccine. During his March 11 testimony to the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Fauci said it could take a year and a half to roll out a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine. There are 70 vaccines in development, according to the World Health Organization — three of which are in clinical trials. The first trial began in mid-March. The potential vaccine was developed by NIAID scientists in partnership with pharmaceutical company Moderna, Inc. A search of the Securities Exchange Commission’s database, which contains information on publicly traded companies, turned up no documents linking Fauci directly to Moderna. According to a statement from the National Institutes of Health, which houses the NIAID, manufacturing for the potential vaccine was supported by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a foundation that funds vaccine research. The Gates Foundation said in its February release that it will allocate some of its research and development funding to the coalition. So Gates' money is indirectly going toward the development of a potential coronavirus vaccine created by NIAID scientists, but not to the agency itself. And there is no publicly available evidence that Fauci personally stands to profit from a vaccine. The Facebook post claims that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine heal ""98% of coronavirus patients"" and have improved ""hundreds of people’s symptoms."" There is no evidence to back that up. With more than 50 studies in the works, there is still much scientists don’t know about how hydroxychloroquine affects the coronavirus. But four studies — two from France and two from China — have come to conflicting conclusions. One study of 62 patients in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the pandemic, found that those who were issued hydroxychloroquine saw their body temperature and cough go down faster than the control group. But a separate group of doctors in Shanghai found that the drug had no discernible effect on a group of 30 patients over the course of a week. One hospital in Marseilles gave 80 COVID-19 patients a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, an antibiotic. After five days, 95% of the patients tested negative for the coronavirus. But a similar hospital study in Paris found no marked improvement in 10 patients. Bottom line: We still don’t know whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is effective at improving COVID-19 symptoms. That uncertainty, as well as the drugs’ adverse heart effects and the potential for doctors to stockpile it, is why public health officials have urged caution. There are no Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs to treat COVID-19, although the agency has issued an emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in hospitals. A Facebook post claims Fauci has downplayed the potential use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus patients because he stands to lose $100 million on a Gates-funded vaccine. There are 70 potential COVID-19 vaccines in development, one of which was created by NIAID scientists in partnership with Moderna, Inc. That vaccine is being manufactured by an organization that the Gates Foundation supports, but there’s no evidence that NIAID or Fauci will directly profit from that support. And the Gates Foundation has pledged up to $60 million for vaccine development, not $100 million, as the post says. Some studies have found that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could help treat coronavirus patients, but others have found no effect at all. Public health officials have urged caution due to the uncertainty and the adverse side effects of the drugs. The Facebook post is inaccurate.

""Now that a team of doctors have been able to identify/diagnose what it is and name it suddenly it’s a big deal. NEWS FLASH!!!! Half of you idiots already had it and got over it!!"" ""U.S. authorities only just started testing for it, and even now testing is severely limited, so in all likelihood, many have had or do have it, and it’s gotten passed off as just a typical cold — because (AHEM, NEWSFLASH) it IS just a bad cold for the vast majority of people who get it"" another post said. ""The normal cold and flus that we’ve already been dealing with kill thousands every season — it just doesn’t get talked about because it’s nothing new and the media can’t use it to panic us at this point.""

Both posts, which have been shared nearly 100,000 times combined, were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what you need to know about the history of the COVID-19. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses including the common cold and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), according to the World Health Organization. And they’re zoonotic, which means that they are transmitted between animals and humans. Vincent Racaniello, a professor microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, has said that the likely, distant source of COVID-19 is bats, ""but we don’t know who was between bats and people."" It could be a direct infection between bats and humans. COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus that was discovered in 2019. It hadn’t previously been identified in humans. As of March 16, 164,837 cases have been confirmed in 146 countries, and 6,470 people have died, according to WHO. In the United States, there are 1,678 confirmed cases. The first COVID-19 case was reported to the World Health Organization from Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31, 2019. On March 13, though, the South China Morning Post reported on unpublished Chinese government data indicating that the earliest case was Nov. 17, 2019, according to the Guardian. Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, told PolitiFact that there’s at least evidence that there were four cases in China from earlier in December than the first reported case in Wuhan on Dec. 31. And since it’s a new virus and the early symptoms are similar to the flu, it’s possible cases existed in China even earlier than that, he said. ""However,"" he said, ""in the U.S., it is very unlikely we had cases in November or December, given what we know about the course of the disease and its later symptoms. The first cases in the U.S. were, in fact, travelers that brought the virus from China or other countries."" Vox recently reported that an analysis of the coronavirus’ genome by Tanja Stadler, a professor of computational biology at ETH Zurich and a molecular epidemiology expert, found that the virus emerged in humans in China in the first half of November 2019. ""The widespread hypothesis that the first person was infected at an animal market in November is still plausible,"" Stadler said in a statement. ""Our data effectively rule out the scenario that the virus circulated in humans for a long time before that."" The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States was reported on Jan. 20. The patient, a 35-year-old man, had had a cough and fever for four days when he went to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, on Jan. 19. He had recently returned to Washington state from Wuhan, China, on Jan. 15. The source of his infection is unknown, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. We’ve already debunked claims that the new coronavirus is ""simply the common cold."" These Facebook posts make unsubstantiated claims that many people have been infected and recovered from COVID-19 well before the first cases were documented in the United States and even China.

907,32598,The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) will be reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule 2 drug in August 2016.,"June 21, 2016","A purportedly credible source reported that the DEA would be reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule 2 drug in August 2016, but the DEA has denied petitions to that effect.",Kim LaCapria,"In mid-June 2016, rumors began to circulate on social media claiming that the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) would effectively be legalizing marijuana by moving it from Schedule 1 classification (drugs with no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States) to Schedule 2 (drugs that have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States), which would pot to be used and researched for medical purposes. A 18 June 2016 article published by the Santa Monica Observer included commentary from an anonymous source said to be a DEA lawyer in which the difference between Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 classifications was explained: The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration will reclassify marijuana as a “Schedule Two” drug on August 1, 2016, essentially legalizing medicinal cannabis in all 50 states with a doctor’s prescription, said a DEA lawyer with knowledge of the matter. The DEA Lawyer had told the lawyer representing a DEA informant of the DEA’s plan to legalize medicinal cannibis nationwide on August 1, 2016. When questioned by our reporter, the DEA lawyer felt compelled to admit the truth to him as well. “Whatever the law may be in California, Arizona or Utah or any other State, because of Federal preemption this will have the effect of making THC products legal with a prescription, in all 50 states,” the DEA attorney told the Observer. Federal Preemption is a legal doctrine that where the US Government regulates a particular field, State and local laws are overridden and of no effect. He explained that “there are five DEA schedules. Nothing on Schedule One is ever legal, and that is where Cannabis is today. Schedule Two drugs are available with a prescription.” The article stated that marijuana would be rescheduled alongside “Percocet, Aderall [sic], Oxycontin, Hydrocodone and other drugs that are legal, even common, with a prescription” as a Schedule 2 drug. It continued with speculation that California’s medical marijuana industry would view the move as unwelcome competition: He opined that the 135 medicinal cannabis clinic owners in Los Angeles will no doubt oppose this move by the Federal government, because the rule change will eliminate any reason for people to visit medical marijuana clinics. “In my opinion, CVS pharmacy, Rite-Aid and Walgreens will sell Schedule Two THC products similar to what users call “edibles,” but will not sell smokeable weed because of the health risk smoking anything entails,” said the DEA lawyer … He speculated that this action will be taken in the closing days of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, so as to motivate the Democratic base to turn out and vote for Hillary Clinton[.] The item was popular among residesnts of states without flexible medical marijuana policies, as it suggested that the sale of weed lozenges at CVS was on the horizon, but remarks about the change being election year maneuvering bordered on conspiracy theory. And not everyone was convinced the anonymous source was credible — a post on the Daily Chronic blog expressed considerable skepticism of the assertion: Shouldn’t we be excited? Not quite, as this “news” is unlikely to be true. The entire article — which has since been cited as fact by several pro-cannabis blogs — is speculation and rumor from a source that is identified only as “The DEA Lawyer.” According to the second paragraph of the article, “The DEA Lawyer had told the lawyer representing a DEA informant of the DEA’s plan to legalize medicinal cannibis [sic] nationwide on August 1, 2016.” This, the second paragraph of the article, should be as far as anyone needs to read to realize that this article is hastily written, poorly researched, and simply speculation or a rumor, including the misspelling of “cannabis” and a poorly worded sentence structure. Throughout the Observer’s article, the sole source of this information is only ever referred to as an attorney who wishes to remain anonymous. Reputable journalists rarely use an anonymous source as the sole source of information because they simply can not be properly vetted. According to guidelines issued by the Associated Press (AP), one of the world’s largest news organizations, articles must be properly vetted before publication — including requiring more than one source. In rare cases, one source will be sufficient – but only when the information comes from an authoritative figure who provides information so detailed that there is no question of its accuracy, according to the AP. For example, a press release issued by the DEA, or a statement from a DEA spokesperson, but not an anonymous attorney acting as the sole source of information. That marijuana-centric outlet decried the swift circulation of the rumor-as-fact across social media and cannabis blogs: [E]ven more reputable sites such as marijuana.com were also fooled, although they took a slightly more cautious approach with their headline, “DEA Attorney Claims Feds Will Reschedule Marijuana This Summer.” But does this mean that the DEA won’t reschedule cannabis? No. In April, the DEA said they were prepared to respond to an administrative petition calling for the reclassification of marijuana, a petition that was launched in 2011. Replying to a July 2015 inquiry by US Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and seven other senators, representatives from the DEA acknowledged that they intend to respond to a five-year-old rescheduling petition, filed by then Governors Christine Gregoire of Washington and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island. The DEA’s response is expected by July 1. The DEA last decided on a similar rescheduling petition in 2011. The agency rejected that petition, alleging, “At this time, the known risks of marijuana use have not been shown to be outweighed by specific benefits in well-controlled clinical trials that scientifically evaluate safety and efficacy.” On 17 June 2016, business site Inc. addressed what such a change might mean for the fledgling cannabis industry, noting that marijuana’s rescheduling would subject many businesses to a change in regulation and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight: If marijuana becomes a Schedule II drug, the FDA would subject companies to intense inspections and testing. Companies would need to get their packaging and labeling approved by the FDA; the Federal Trade Commission would be there to ensure companies don’t sink to unfair or deceptive marketing and advertising practices. If marijuana was de-scheduled, and placed into the same category of alcohol and tobacco, it would fall under the purview of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. That has its own maw of legal hoops to maneuver. “If the FDA came out and said we are making cannabis Schedule II and the entire industry didn’t change, the whole industry would be illegally trafficking a Schedule II substance,” says Hank Levy, a CPA for marijuana companies, including Harborside, one of the largest dispensaries in the nation. Simply put, the industry as it stands today would not be legal under a whole set of other laws. “I don’t see Schedule II as being any help here for the existing cannabis industry at all,” says Ittleman, who notes that the changes likely open the door to big pharmaceutical companies that have the experience manufacturing Schedule II controlled substances. “This is the red carpet for Purdue Pharma and Pfizer to enter the industry,” adds Ittleman. The Denver Post (based in Colorado, where marijuana is currently legal for recreational use) ran an editorial surmising that states with laws allowing for broader use of legal cannabis would suffer fiscal losses under a rescheduling of the substance: If the DEA keeps marijuana on Schedule I, the federal government risks continued suffering by those with true medical ailments and continued lack of scientific study. The DEA would be wildly out of step with rapidly changing public opinion. If the DEA de-schedules marijuana, big tobacco companies could take over, and the fears of many anti-marijuana advocates would be realized. Rescheduling marijuana for medical/prescription use, but shutting down the state recreational side, would result in unintended negative consequences. Because prescriptions are not taxed, state and local jurisdictions would lose millions of dollars in tax revenues. Colorado collected nearly $135 million in medical and recreational marijuana taxes and license fees in 2015 on a combined medical and recreational market of nearly $1 billion. With a prescription-only industry, states would lose their current marijuana-related jobs to existing pill-manufacturing companies. Claims that marijuana would move from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2 on 1 August 2016 initially excited folks in states without laws allowing for medical or recreational use of the substance, but the claims were made by an anonymous source to a small community newspaper. And in August 2016 the DEA dashed those hopes by announcing they had declined two rescheduling petitions:  DEA has denied two petitions to reschedule marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). In response to the petitions, DEA requested a scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which was conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in consultation with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Based on the legal standards in the CSA, marijuana remains a schedule I controlled substance because it does not meet the criteria for currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, there is a lack of accepted safety for its use under medical supervision, and it has a high potential for abuse. In his letter to the petitioners, DEA Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg offered a detailed response outlining the factual and legal basis for the denial of the petitions. The full responses to the petitions can be found in the Federal Register. Response 1 AND Response 2  The DEA and the FDA continue to believe that scientifically valid and well-controlled clinical trials conducted under investigational new drug (IND) applications are the most appropriate way to conduct research on the medicinal uses of marijuana. Furthermore, DEA and FDA believe that the drug approval process is the most appropriate way to assess whether a product derived from marijuana or its constituents is safe and effective and has an accepted medical use. This pathway allows the FDA the important ability to determine whether a product meets the FDA criteria for safety and effectiveness for approval.",false,"Politics, DEA, FDA, marijuana"

He made the statement while promoting a bill that would repeal what he considers to be unnecessary laws. A 73-year-old federal law does make it a crime for non-dentists who make false teeth to ship their wares out of state. But it doesn’t restrict citizens from wearing their dentures wherever they go. The congressman didn’t mention that. So Goodlatte’s claim is accurate but needs a clarification.",Sean Gorman,"Our jaws dropped when U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte called for the repeal of a federal law banning the transport of dentures across state lines. Does such a law really exist? Goodlatte, R-6th, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, made the statement during a Nov. 24 radio interview on ""The John Fredericks Show"" in Portsmouth. He was touting a bill his committee passed Nov. 18 that would strike a number of what he considers to be superfluous laws. ""There is a federal criminal law that says it’s a crime to transport dentures across state lines,"" he said. ""So we’re getting rid of that."" Seeking more information, we contacted Beth Breeding, Goodlatte’s communications director. She pointed us to a section of the U.S. code called the Federal Denture Act of 1942. It’s a murky law, and we had trouble finding experts who know about it. It turns out that some states have laws that only dentures provided by licensed dentists can be sold within their borders, and other states don’t have that mandate. The federal law says its purpose is to protect the integrity of state laws requiring dentist-made false teeth and to promote good oral health. Those who violate the law can be charged criminally or reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We wondered how often people have been charged with the federal crime. Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, told us his department looked back over the past decade, starting in 2004, and could not find records of any charges being filed under the provision. If no one is being prosecuted, is there still any value in having the law? The answer depends on who makes the dentures. Maria Lopez Howell, a consumer adviser with the American Dental Association, said the law protects people by making sure their dentures are provided by someone ""who has been trained to do this very customized work."" On the other side of the fence are denturists - technicians who have been trained in making dentures but do not have medical degrees. Paul M. Levasseur, secretary of the National Denturist Association, called the restriction on interstate transport of false teeth ""a strange law."" ""While I've never heard of anyone being prosecuted, it is probably a case of protectionism by organized dentistry,"" Levasseur said in an email. The New York Times documented the dispute between dentists and denturists in 2007. Denturists said they were highly trained and sometimes work under the supervision of a dentist. The ADA said the technicians aren’t trained to diagnose mouth diseases or to spot broken roots of teeth, which can cause harm if not corrected before dentures are inserted. All of this debate, however, ignores a more basic question: Can grandpa wear his false teeth across state lines without the risk of prosecution? The answer is yes. ""If you have a family member who has dentures, they can still travel across the United States without any consequences,"" Howell said. Levasseur told us, ""I believe this deals with commerce not individuals."" Our ruling Goodlatte said it’s a federal crime ""to transport dentures across state lines."" He made the statement while promoting a bill that would repeal what he considers to be unnecessary laws.

The Facebook user, saying the media highlights that Florida’s COVID-19 cases are surging, cited a table of Worldometer data. When we checked the site’s state data on July 29, we found that Florida’s death rate was one-sixth of New Jersey’s and New York’s. The same was true on other databases we checked, including one from Johns Hopkins University. But it’s a limited measure, bearing on a state that became a hotspot well after New York and New Jersey. Here’s what news reports said about Florida’s record-breaking coronavirus surge in the days before the post: Florida had the highest single-day total of new cases by any state, with more than 15,000 new infections. There were 872 deaths in one week, the highest weekly total in the Sunshine State during the outbreak. Florida was among the 21 states with outbreaks serious enough to place them in the ""red zone,"" according to a federal report. For a larger perspective, among the 20 countries currently most affected by COVID-19, the United States has the fourth-highest death rate per 100,000 people, behind the United Kingdom, Peru and Chile, according to Johns Hopkins University. Timing is a big reason why the statistic cited in the Facebook post is misleading. New Jersey and New York were hit hard early in the pandemic, and Florida was hit later. ""One has to wait until all is over to really see how ‘well’ states have been doing,"" Dr. Werner Bischoff, professor of infectious diseases at Wake Forest University, told PolitiFact. As of July 30, Florida recorded 988 COVID-19 deaths in the previous seven days, compared with 91 in New Jersey and 114 in New York, according to the New York Times. Death counts and rates are lagging indicators, which means they can confirm a trend after the fact, but can’t necessarily predict the course of the outbreak. ""While cases started to increase exponentially in Florida in June, deaths only started to increase exponentially in July,"" Boston University global health professor Brooke Nichols told PolitiFact. ""The only way to compare these types of death rates meaningfully would be once we are several months after Florida’s first wave — and compare that to several months after the first wave in New York and New Jersey,"" she said. Nichols gave an example. On April 4, when the first wave of cases in New York peaked, the state had 237 deaths per 1 million population. Using July 16 as a peak in cases for Florida, the death rate was 223 deaths per million. ""Those two numbers are eerily similar, and a foreshadow of what’s to come in Florida,"" Nichols said.

Activist and treegrower Siyabulela Sokomani, who is running carrying a wild olive, said the group of friends is raising cash to plant 2,000 trees in Khayelitsha, one of Cape Town’s biggest townships, where many of them come from.

The most obvious interpretation of this statement is that Gardner wants to ban condoms -- something that’s based on an incorrect interpretation of the measures Gardner has supported in the past (and which he has since distanced himself from). Gardner says he doesn’t support banning condoms, and in any case, condoms would not be at issue under the personhood measure he once supported.",Louis Jacobson,"Even amid a torrent of campaign ads during the waning days of the 2014 midterm election cycle, a new television ad in Colorado’s tight Senate race certainly stands out. It addresses a topic -- abortion and birth control -- that have recurred often in the campaign between incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall and Republican Rep. Cory Gardner. But the imagery, and the claim, make the ad unusual. The ad shows footage of a young, partially dressed couple in a bed, with the man reaching for a condom on the night table. ""Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!"" the narration says. ""If Cory Gardner gets his way, you'd better stock up on condoms."" In bold type, the ad offers a visual saying, ""Gardner: Ban birth control."" The ad’s sponsors -- the abortion-rights groups NARAL Pro-Choice America and NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado -- frame the ad as an ""edgy"" attempt to reach young voters. (The ad also makes claims about climate change, but we won’t address those in this fact-check.) How accurate is the claim about condoms? We have previously addressed claims on Gardner and birth control, but this one is slightly different, so we’ll take a closer look. First, here’s what the Gardner campaign said when we asked about the ad. ""Cory does not want to ban condoms,"" said campaign spokesman Alex Siciliano. ""In fact, he believes in increased access to contraceptives. He has proposed making common forms of oral contraception available over the counter."" So where does the ad get its evidence from? Past claims about Gardner and birth control have stemmed from his support of efforts to support ""personhood"" measures that would define life beginning at fertilization to the Colorado Constitution. In the U.S. House of Representatives, Gardner co-sponsored H.R. 1091, known formally as the Life At Conception Act and informally as a ""personhood"" bill. The bill was introduced April 8, 2013, by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. According to the bill text, it would ""implement equal protection for the right to life of each born and preborn human person"" and ""declares that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being."" It goes on to say that "" 'human person' and 'human being' include each and every member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being."" Opponents of personhood legislation say that giving a fertilized egg all the rights of person could make illegal several FDA-approved contraceptives, such as the pill and intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Anti-abortion groups successfully petitioned to get personhood measures on the Colorado ballot in 2008 and 2010. Both times it was rejected by more than 70 percent of voters. As we have noted in the past, we can’t predict how the courts would interpret personhood legislation or their impacts on forms of birth control that are currently legal. Though even Gardner acknowledges that some contraceptives could be at risk if personhood passed, a lot of legal ambiguity remains. Because no state has passed a personhood measure, we don’t know how it could impact specific types of contraceptives. As we’ve noted in past articles about the debate over personhood, some legal scholars and the medical community have cautioned that it could potentially impact access to birth control. Gardner’s critics may have a point that some forms of birth control could be outlawed if personhood measures became law -- but that shouldn’t affect condoms. That’s because condoms prevent sperm from reaching the egg in the first place. No fertilization ever takes place. In a further twist, Gardner made a major about-face during the 2014 campaign, saying he no longer supports the personhood movement, partly because he now thinks it could potentially impact access to certain forms of birth control. ""The fact that it restricts contraception, it was not the right position,"" Gardner told The Denver Post. ""I've learned to listen. I don't get everything right the first time."" Gardner has also said that if the Affordable Care Act is not repealed, he wants to allow the birth control pill to be sold over-the-counter without a prescription. Udall’s campaign said he supports allowing over-the-counter sales of the pill as long as insurance companies are still mandated to cover it without any cost sharing. Finally, Gardner’s campaign notes that in 2007, he was one of five to cosponsor an anti-abortion measure in Colorado that specified that ""nothing in this section shall prohibit the sale, use, prescription or administration of a contraceptive measure, device, drug or chemical."" This bill, his campaign said, demonstrates that Gardner is not anti-contraceptive. The ad’s sponsors didn’t get back to PolitiFact, but Doug Gordon, a spokesman for NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado, told our friends at FactCheck.org that ""we're not saying he is banning condoms. We are saying if Gardner starts limiting other forms of birth control, you better stock up on condoms because there will be so much demand for them — since Gardner wants to ban other forms of birth control.""

It seems much more plausible to us that viewers of the TV ad would assume that Gardner wants to ban birth control, period.

How to make sure you’re getting the real cheese https://t.co/Fc26zvCRaQ pic.twitter.com/GBaD5Fdxqc — TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 18, 2016  FDA discovers that ‘100% real’ Parmesan cheese you’re eating may be wood: https://t.co/aA1fDDRUyb pic.twitter.com/zMJQQFi4RX — PCMag (@PCMag) February 18, 2016  “Wood,” “wood in parmesan,” and “cheese … may be wood” weren’t very ambiguous ways to describe the claim. On 17 February 2016, USA Today published an article that claimed: Parmesan cheese or wood pulp? Chances are when you sprinkle parmesan on your spaghetti you may be getting a little of both. … while the idea of eating a product that contains wood pulp doesn’t seem appetizing, you probably do it more than you think. That item cited Bloomberg Businessweek, the outlet that apparently kicked off the flurry of wood worry. After mentioning a 2012 FDA investigation, the site reported they’d done their own independent testing for “wood pulp” in several cheeses: How serious is the problem? Bloomberg News had store-bought grated cheese tested for wood-pulp content by an independent laboratory … Essential Everyday 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese, from Jewel-Osco, was 8.8 percent cellulose, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Great Value 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese registered 7.8 percent, according to test results. Whole Foods 365 brand didn’t list cellulose as an ingredient on the label, but still tested at 0.3 percent. Kraft had 3.8 percent. Some of the less sensational aspects of that article provided a clearer picture of the actual controversy. Bloomberg Businessweek clarified the ingredient in question was actually cellulose (not “wood pulp” per se) and that blending of lesser cheeses was part of the overall dispute: Some grated Parmesan suppliers have been mislabeling products by filling them with too much cellulose, a common anti-clumping agent made from wood pulp, or using cheaper cheddar, instead of real Romano. Someone had to pay. Castle President Michelle Myrter is scheduled to plead guilty this month to criminal charges. She faces up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine. Although most outlets referenced “cellulose,” the FDA’s list of food additives generally recognized as safe primarily listed carboxymethylcellulose (cellulose gum) as an approved additive in cheese production, which isn’t necessarily made from wood. The FDA said: Cellulose is a major constituent of many foods of plant origin. As such it is a significant portion of the diet, but is neither degraded nor absorbed. Cellulose derivatives considered in this report are virtually unabsorbed and little or no degradation of absorbable products occurs in the human digestive tract. In man, consumption of large amounts appears to have no effect other than providing dietary bulk, reducing the nutritive value of such foodstuffs and possibly exerting a laxative effect. Many of the FDA’s regulatory provisions pertained not to the safety of the carboxymethycellulose, but concentration thresholds for specific cheese labeling (in this instance, pasteurized cheese spread): One or any mixture of two or more of the following: Carob bean gum, gum karaya, gum tragacanth, guar gum, gelatin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (cellulose gum), carrageenan, oat gum, algin (sodium alginate), propylene glycol alginate, or xanthan gum. The total weight of such substances is not more than 0.8 percent of the weight of the finished food. In this case, the FDA appeared less concerned with the safety of cellulose in cheese and more so with labeling standards. A 2011 Mayo Clinic item focused on the increasing use of cellulose in foods for a variety of reasons, but did not mention any health risks: Small cellulose particles impart a smooth consistency, mouthfeel and stickiness to products such as salad dressings, barbecue sauces and, yes, ice cream. Longer fiber lengths provide structure and a firmer texture to baked goods. Cellulose also helps capture and retain moisture and keeps products from seeming dry. We’re seeing more foods with added fiber, such as cellulose, because most people aren’t eating enough foods that are naturally high in fiber — namely vegetables, fruits and whole grains. Manufacturers are also adding cellulose because it means they can use less fat and sugar without losing the desired mouthfeel or moistness. The rising cost of flour, sugar and oil may be another reason for this trend. Castle Cheese was the recipient of a FDA warning letter dated 11 July 2013, and the mention of cellulose had to do with possible labeling inconsistencies, not wood in cheese: 3. Your International Packing Parmesan Cheese, (b)(4) Romano 100% Grated Cheese and (b)(4) 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese products are adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(b)(4) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(b)(4)] in that a substance has been added to increase the products’ bulk and weight. Specifically, cellulose and/or starch were used to increase the weight of the cheese base used to manufacture your products. Another approach during the February 2016 wood cheese dustup came in the form of a February 2016 Bon Appétit article. The piece made a distinction between proper labeling of specific cheeses and the presence of “wood pulp” in parmesan: Eating cellulose won’t kill you. There are no known harmful side effects from adding it to food, and it’s completely legal. “Cellulose is a non-digestible plant fiber, and we actually happen to need non-digestible vegetable fiber in our food—that’s why people eat bran flakes and psyllium husks,” says Jeff Potter, author of Cooking for Geeks. And though it makes for more sensational headlines, it’s not quite accurate to claim that something made with cellulose is part “wood pulp,” as implied in a rather breathless Bloomberg News headline. Noting that cellulose was “completely safe to eat,” the magazine again expressed skepticism at the widespread conflation of cellulose and “wood pulp”: So could part of the faux-Parmesan cheese you eat once have had a tire-swing hanging from it? Sure …But it could also have been made in part from a crateful of apples that didn’t make it onto supermarket shelves, or corn husks, or any variety of plant matter. It could even have been made from the crate the apples came in. By the time it becomes cellulose, it’s pretty much just a tasteless powder whose primary purpose in life is to take up space… It’s like an accountant at a rock concert after-party. It’s worth noting, by the way, that the official FDA warning letter to Castle Cheese Inc. lists cellulose and starch as adulterants they discovered, but that they don’t mention wood pulp anywhere in the text. Blame easy conflation by an overeager headline writer. We’ve all done it. The cellulose-in-food scare was nothing new. On 2 July 2014, Slate covered a then-current panic over wood pulp in burgers: This media meme, catching on like wildfire burning up so much delicious wood pulp, is not only alarmist but 100 percent misleading. … It’s pure fiber, so it contains no calories. Cellulose is a natural component of all plants’ cell walls and is therefore in contained in every fruit or vegetable you might care to eat … A single article in February 2016 launched a wave of responses to the “news” that cheese contained cellulose, widely described as “wood pulp.” But the news was not all that new, as even the original item referenced a controversy that began in late 2012. The FDA indeed investigated cheese manufacturers over the presence of cellulose in cheese, but only in the larger context of honest labeling (not safety or health concerns). Cellulose is considered safe in all expected concentrations (though it could certainly dilute the flavor of parmesan) and it didn’t in any way resemble wood or wood pulp as many outlets suggested. Finally, the early 2016 outpouring of concern was not new at the time it occurred. In 2014, the same media “meme” latched on to “wood pulp in fast food,” ignoring its presence in a vast quantity of other widely eaten foods. While it was true many cheeses were held to strict standards of labeling, the controversy over cellulose was confined to purity and misrepresentation, not the sneaky addition of wood to otherwise benign cheese.",false,"Food, bloomberg businessweek, carboxymethylcellulose, cellulose"
914,24306,"The president's health care proposals will cause ""most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people lose their current insurance coverage.","January 28, 2010",Health care reform does not increase premiums and boot people out of their coverage,Angie Drobnic Holan,"In an interesting display of chutzpah from a television pundit, Republican strategist Nancy Pfotenhauer claimed on CNN that she understood perfectly the president's health care proposals, then proceeded to distort them. ""You've got an extremely talented man here who's a great orator,"" she said after President Barack Obama's State of the Union address. ""I don't think anybody could challenge that. But if there's a sin, it's hubris, and at one point, when he was talking about health care, he literally said, you know, hey, you're not with me, but that's okay. I understand. I just didn't speak clearly enough to you. Like if I slow down and talk in smaller words, maybe you'll get it."" ""And so the response is, no, no, you explained it, I heard it and I disagreed with you,"" she added. ""You're talking about a proposal that increases taxes by half a trillion dollars, that cuts Medicare by half a trillion dollars, that causes most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people to lose their current insurance coverage. This is not something that's good."" (That didn't get challenged by host Larry King, who then went to a commercial.) Pfotenhauer boiled down some complicated issues we've been reporting on for quite a while into a zinger of a soundbite. A bit of what she said was true, but most of this is a significant distortion of Obama's reforms. Here, we're going to rule on the most dramatic part of her claim, that the plans cause ""most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people lose their current insurance coverage."" We contacted Pfotenhauer, who served as an adviser to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, and asked what the basis of her claims were. But we didn't hear back. We've written before about the Democratic proposals to increase taxes to pay for expanded health care coverage. The House bill increases income taxes on the wealthy, and the Senate bill has an excise tax for high-cost health care plans, or ""Cadillac"" plans. Add up those taxes, plus other revenue provisions in the form of fees, and those revenues do approach $500 billion over 10 years. On Medicare spending, both bills seek to curb spending on Medicare by trimming excess payments to private insurers under the Medicare Advantage program, as well as other freezes on payments intended to reduce waste. (Check out this comparison on the details on Medicare created by the independent Kaiser Family Foundation. You'll find details on Medicare changes on Page 14.) Those provisions too approach $500 billion over 10 years. But the measure also includes more funding for Medicare's prescription drug plan. Then Pfotenhauer said most Americans would ""have their premiums increased, not decreased,"" and that ""hundreds of millions of people lose their current insurance coverage."" On Nov. 30, 2009, the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, released a detailed analysis on how health insurance premiums might be affected by the Senate Democrats' health care bill. The CBO is an independent agency whose estimates for pending legislation are considered nonpartisan and rigorous. The CBO reported that, for most people, premiums would stay about the same, or slightly decrease. This was especially true for people who get their insurance through work. (Health policy wonks call these the large group and small group markets.) People who have to go out and buy insurance on their own (the individual market) would see rates increase by 10 to 13 percent. But more than half of those people -- 57 percent, in fact -- would be eligible for subsidies to help them pay for the insurance. People who get subsidies would see their premiums drop by more than half, according to the CBO. So most people would see their premiums stay the same or potentially drop. As for ""hundreds of millions of people"" losing their coverage, there is little evidence to support this. Republicans have been making the claim based on a study by the Lewin Group, which stated that 123 million people would choose a public option for health insurance if it were cheaper than their current coverage. (The Lewin Group is respected by many health care analysts and operates with editorial independence, but it is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, whose primary business is private health insurance.) There were other problems with how Republicans have used the Lewin study to claim that people would be pushed out of their coverage, and you can read more about those problems in another item we reported back in October. But it's not necessary to go into those details because the Senate has since rejected a public option. So it's not clear where Pfotenhauer is getting her numbers now. Certainly there will be some churn among plans, just as there is now, when companies change insurance plans. (For this reason, we gave Obama a Half True for saying that people could keep their current coverage. Under the plan, employers would still be able to choose new plans.) But the CBO has found that the numbers of uninsured will be lower under the Democratic plans. The Senate Democrats plan would increase the percentage of the insured from 83 percent to 94 percent. So we don't see how millions of people would lose their current coverage. It's true that there is a lot of confusion among the public about the health care proposals. The independent Kaiser Family Foundation recently conducted a poll and found that ""even after a year of substantial media coverage of the health reform debate, many Americans remain unfamiliar with key elements of the major bills passed by the House and Senate."" The poll also found tremendous differences based on political affiliations: Democrats supported the proposals, Republicans opposed them, and independents were roughly split. In Pfotenhauer's appearance on CNN, though, she said she understood the proposals but disagreed with them. Then she said -- and this was not phrased as an opinion -- that the plans will cause ""most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people to lose their current insurance coverage."" There's not an independent, nonpartisan analysis out there on the current Democratic proposals that shows that. These are Republican talking points that have repeatedly been proven false, but they keep coming back. Pfotenhauer's statement is not just false, it's ridiculously so. !",false,"National, Health Care, Pundits, Nancy Pfotenhauer, "
915,35181,An 1875 report by the Horseless Carriage Committee warned about the dangers of gasoline-fueled vehicles.,"May 29, 2008","“This discovery begins a new era in the history of civilization. It may some day prove to be more revolutionary in the development of human society than the invention of the wheel, the use of metals, or the steam engine. Never in history has society been confronted with a power so full of potential danger and at the same time so full of promise for the future of man and for the peace of the world.",David Mikkelson,"Many of us take especial delight in items that document how people of earlier times severely misjudged their futures, either holding expectations of a vastly improved world that proved to be ridiculously grandiose, or expressing woefully misplaced fears and concerns about dangers that never came to pass. The same principle can be applied in reverse, however — one common form of  satire is to lampoon a particular position on a modern political or social issue by projecting it into the past to highlight its ridiculousness. Into which category does the following purported 1875 report by the “Horseless Carriage Committee” warning about the dangers of gasoline and gasoline-powered vehicles fall: an example of 19th century citizens expressing exaggerated fears about a then-new technology, or a modern  piece of satire intended to make a point about a 20th century issue? “A new source of power called gasoline has been produced by a Boston engineer. Instead of burning the fuel under a boiler, it is exploded inside the cylinder of an engine. The dangers are obvious. Stores of gasoline in the hands of people interested primarily in profit would constitute a fire and explosive hazard of the first rank. “Horseless carriages propelled by gasoline might attain speeds of 14 or even 20 miles per hour. The menace to our people of vehicles of this type hurtling through our streets and along our roads and poisoning the atmosphere would call for prompt legislative action even if the military and economic implications were not so overwhelming. The cost of producing gasoline is far beyond the financial capacity of private industry. In addition, the development of this new power may displace the use of horses, which would wreck our agriculture.” Horseless Carriage Committee, U. S. Congressional Record, c. 1875. The first clue is that the dating of the report appears to be anachronistic. The year 1875 was the dawn of experiments in building gasoline-fueled, internal combustion engines and using them to power wheeled vehicles, and the term “horseless carriage” to refer to such vehicles didn’t come into use until the 1890s, when the public was much more familiar with the concept of the automobile. Researchers at the Library of Congress expressed similar thinking in responding to a query about this item:    This is in response to your inquiry about trying to verify a quote before the congressional “Horseless Carriage Committee.” This in fact an urban legend. We checked “Committees in the U.S. Congress,” published by CQ Press and verified that there never was a “Horseless Carriage Committee.” We also checked the Congressional Record Index (indexing debate in Congress), the Congressional Hearings Index and the U.S. Serial Set which indexes congressional reports and documents and found no references. Indeed the terms “gasoline” or “horseless carriage” do not even appear in these sources for this time period. We also checked these sources using the terms “automobile” and “petroleum” and again found no references for this time period. We also believe this statement is anachronistic. In 1876 Nicholas Otto of Germany invented and built the first gas motor engine and then built it into a motorcycle. Subsequently in 1885 Karl Benz designed and built the first practical automobile to be powered by an internal combustion engine. The first gasoline powered automobile built in the United States was in 1891 by John Lampert and was a three wheeled motor vehicle. The first U.S. patent for a gasoline powered automobile was issued in 1895 and the first U.S. company to manufacture automobiles was founded in 1896 by the Duryea brothers. Another clue is that all the concerns stated in the putative report about gasoline and gasoline-powered vehicles — potential for dangerous explosions, poisoning of the atmosphere, military and economic implications, development costs exceeding the financial resources of the private business sector, potential for displacement of existing industries — sound very much like the apprehensions that were expressed about atomic power in the years after the end of World War II. In fact, both lines of thinking are correct: The “Horseless Carriage Committee” report dates not from 1875 but from the late 1950s, and it is a bit of fiction created for (and excerpted from) a much longer editorial intended to point out the dangers of the U.S. government’s capitalizing on all those fears to justify controlling the development and application of atomic power:  Individually, we tend to learn from experience. Collectively, if mankind can be viewed as a collective, we tend to repeat the same old mistakes. The differences between the government of Julius Caesar and of Dwight Eisenhower are minor and of academic interest. The parallels are startling and numerous. Today, in this world of scientific advancement, we live under the shadow of political reaction. Let something new come to the attention of the politicians and steps are immediately taken to control it, to limit it, or to repeal it. If none of these things is feasible, the politicians then devise a program whereby they can own it outright. It is said that Tiberius Caesar cut off the head of a Phoenecian glass blower who had developed a formula for flexible glass. Such a glass, according to Caesar, would have upset the economy and might have become more valuable than gold. Currently, our Washington officials have blanketed pay television, put a crimp in railroad operations, tied the hands of business men by means of taxes and laws which compel union deals and various types of controls, arrested farmers who produce in excess quotas and so forth. The list is nearly endless. To illustrate just how the same old fallacies repeat year after year, we reproduce here a special report by a Joint Congressional Committee on the subject of the horseless carriage. This report was made as a result of the “emergency” occasioned by the development of the internal combustion engine, in the year 1875. “A new source of power, which burns a distillate of kerosene, has been produced by a Boston engineer. Instead of burning the fuel under a boiler, it is exploded inside the cylinder of the engine. This so-called internal combustion engine may be used under certain conditions to supplement steam engines. Experiments are under way to use such an engine to propel a vehicle.",false,"History, Documentary Evidence"

One of the latest comes from Morgan Brittany, a former actress from the original television soap opera Dallas who is now a commentator with the conspiracy-minded blog WND. Brittany suggests that Ebola is part of a larger White House plan to control the nation. Brittany’s column describes a Los Angeles dinner party where the conversation turned grim. ""One of the men brought up the fact that Washington has known for months if not years that we were at risk for some sort of global pandemic,"" Brittany wrote. ""According to a government supplier of emergency products, the Disaster Assistance Response Team was told to be prepared to be activated in the month of October for an outbreak of Ebola. Hmm, that’s just like the fact that they knew 60,000 illegal children were going to be coming across our southern border eight months before it happened."" A few months ago, we debunked that last eyebrow-raising bit about the government being behind the surge of undocumented children at the border. Now, we examine whether something called ""the Disaster Assistance Response Team"" was told to get ready for an outbreak of Ebola. Brittany’s column provided a link to Global Research, another conspiracy website. Global Research had its own alarming article. ""A large government supplier of emergency response products specializing in ‘high risk events’ says that Disaster Assistance Response Teams were told to prepare to be activated in the month of October. The shocking revelation, made on the Golden State FIRE EMS Twitter page, suggests that not only did someone know that the Ebola virus would be reaching America, but that they knew exactly when it would happen."" Global Research even had a screenshot of the Twitter exchange from Sept. 30, and indeed, there we found, ""DART teams were notified months ago they would be activated in October. Timing seems weird. Source: current DART member."" The tweets are authentic. What’s lacking is anything of substance behind them. We spoke to Ed Castillo, president of Golden State FIRE EMS. Castillo was regretful. ""A couple of EMS guys were talking about conspiracy theories,"" Castillo said. ""There are no facts to support it. It can be written off as a couple of guys shooting the breeze."" Golden State is based in Woodland Hills, Calif. Among other services, it contracts with Hollywood film companies to have a medical team on hand when they shoot stunt sequences. Castillo said the company’s only goal now is to ""extinguish the flames"" and stop hearing from conspiracy theorists. ""These guys came out of the woodwork left and right,"" Castillo said. ""We had to tear down our Twitter account. Now we’re just sticking to Facebook and our Web page. We just want to get back to work."" The Golden State tweets might have been vacuous blather taken as reality, but the Global Research and Brittany posts went beyond even what the tweets said. Their reference to a ""large government supplier of emergency response products"" seems to have greatly reimagined Golden State’s line of work. To write about ""the Disaster Assistance Response Team"" as a singular entity also seems odd. Such a name applies generically to any group that jumps in to help in a disaster. Brittany doesn’t write definitively that these theories are accurate but closed her article on a note of fear. ""Maybe the current administration needs this to happen so martial law can be declared, guns can be seized and the populace can be controlled. Once that happens … game over."" Our ruling Brittany passed along as fact that a government supplier knew that emergency responders had been told well in advance to get ready for Ebola.

The state’s governor, Kim Reynolds, says schools should re-open for students who do not have health conditions that would put them at risk if exposed to the novel coronavirus. ""Kids are less likely to get it,"" Reynolds said at a July 14, 2020, news conference about children’s susceptibility to the virus, COVID-19. ""They’re less likely to spread. So I think there’s some pretty good data out there that will help alleviate some of the concerns."" PolitiFact has visited this topic previously, stating that children can catch the virus but that their symptoms aren’t as potent as those in older people. And, President Trump has called forcefully for schools to re-open for the next school year. Deciding to re-open schools that have been closed since mid-March in Iowa while the coronavirus pandemic continues has been a balancing act. Parents and teachers are dealing with the virus’s health threat on students, teachers and staff but also fear negative effects on children isolated at home instead of learning face-to-face with teachers and interacting with other children. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Federation of Teachers, National Education Association and the School Superintendents Association are on record saying interaction is necessary but also caution against moving unsafely when reopening schools. While there’s no mistaking that a child ill with the virus would deal with discomfort, or in a worse scenario serious health risks, existing research backs up Reynold’s statement about the virus’ incidence rate and spread rate for children and research backing that up. In Iowa, 5% of people testing positive for COVID-19 as of July 15 were 17 or younger, state data showed on July 16, 2020. That’s lower than the national rate, which shows 10% of Americans testing positive for COVID-19 were age 17 or younger, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed July 16. Almost one-half of Iowa’s COVID-19 cases were detected in people ages 18 to 40. Researchers concluding, to date, that young children are at less risk than older adults of catching or spreading the virus include: An international research team conducting studies in China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada and South Korea. They concluded that the risk of transmitting the virus under the age of 20 could be as much as one-half the risk for those over the age of 20. They published their findings June 16, 2020, with Nature Medicine. Doctors and researchers at Mayo Clinic, of Rochester, Minnesota. ""While all children are capable of getting the virus that causes COVID-19, they don't become sick as often as adults,"" the clinic’s COVID-19 section on its website states.

Skepticism has existed about the WHO-China report, especially when testing only was done in hospitals. Also, some researchers caution that infection and transmission rates among young people aren’t as high as they are for adults because the youths have not been exposed as much as adults to the virus. And that CDC data? It shows a higher percentage of people age 17 and younger who are tested for the virus showing up positive. Part of the reason for those CDC numbers is that fewer children than adults have been tested, and that what testing has been done has been with children suspected to be at risk. ""Our data is skewed originally to people with symptoms, and then skewed to adults over 18,"" Dr. Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said at a July 8, 2020, White House news briefing. More in-depth study of COVID-19’s affect on children is needed, she said. Five days later, German researchers released a study of students in their country who were exposed to each other in school that, the researchers said, could indicate that COVID-19 might not spread as much among the youths as feared. Pediatricians at Dresden University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus said they reached their conclusions after studying blood samples taken in May and June from 1,541 youths mostly in eighth through 11th grade. The samples were from 13 secondary schools and part of a 2,045-sample test that also included teachers, the researchers said. Reynolds said, ""Kids are less likely to get it (COVID-19). You know, they’re less likely to spread. So I think there’s some pretty good data out there that will help alleviate some of the concerns."" Reynolds’ assertion is supported by the bulk of the existing research, which shows that scientists have seen lower COVID-19 infection rates among young people and have not seen the virus spread among children at the rate as high as the ones for adults. However, researchers have only been able to study the virus since late January 2020, and they are learning more about it by the day. There may also be statistical quirks affecting the data, such as the limited extent to which children are being tested for the virus.

Tim Kaine said he doesn’t have their backs.

""Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization of the V.A.,"" Kaine said July 11. ""That is something that is overwhelmingly rejected by America's veterans. They do not want to go down that path. Do they want improvement? Sure they do. But they don't want risky or radical."" To back up his claim, the Kaine camp pointed to Trump’s campaign page on V.A. reforms and articles suggesting privatization is among them. But the Trump campaign told us Trump’s plan simply gives veterans a choice, and that’s not the same thing as privatization. While Trump wants to give veterans access to health providers outside the V.A. system, Kaine is being overly simplistic by suggesting Trump wants to turn over the whole thing to the private sector. What Trump proposed Trump’s VA plans include some elements of privatization, but it isn’t an outright overhaul of the existing system. At an October 2015 rally in Virginia, Trump said even though some candidates want to get rid of the V.A. (possibly referring to Ben Carson’s proposals to give veterans health savings accounts) he wants to ""supplement"" the existing V.A. system for veterans. ""No, it doesn’t have to be privatization,"" Trump said at a May 2016 press conference. ""What it has to be is when somebody is online and they say it’s a seven-day wait, that person’s going to walk across the street to a private doctor, be taken care of, we’re gonna pay the bill."" Nowhere on his position page or in his July 2016 Virginia Beach speech on veterans issues does Trump propose privatizing the V.A. Instead, he seeks to modernize it, crack down on inefficiency and abuse, and provide more care for female vets and those in in rural areas. He does, however, propose a veterans ID card for use outside of the V.A. system on his campaign website: ""Under a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran’s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately. ...The power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans’ health care dollars."" Similarly, Trump floated the idea in his speech in Virginia: ""We are going to ensure every veteran in America has the choice to seek care at the V.A., or to seek private medical care paid for by our government."" According to the Trump campaign, this is essentially the recommendation of the bipartisan federal Commission on Care, but with more choice in doctors. But veterans groups (many of which support the commission’s recommendations) told us that’s not an entirely accurate comparison. In short, the commission plan folds private health care providers into the V.A. system, while the Trump plan allows veterans to opt out of it. In its 300-page report, the commission emphasized that the V.A. should have oversight over an integrated health care network by vetting, training and coordinating with private sector doctors and clinics that qualify for participation. Trump’s plan, again, gives veterans access to all Medicare providers, but it doesn’t specify that these non-V.A. doctors would have to coordinate or meet the standards of the V.A. The I.D. card proposal also bears some resemblance to the Veterans Choice program, a law sponsored by John McCain that gives veterans access to community providers if they’ve been waiting for more than 30 days for V.A. care or if they live more than 40 miles away from a V.A. facility. Trump’s plan would essentially get rid of these eligibility requirements. Trump advisor Sam Clovis did tell the Wall Street Journal the candidate might model V.A. care after Medicare (like an insurance provider), as the Kaine campaign pointed out, but Clovis also said Trump ""doesn’t want to take away the veterans hospitals and the things that are working out."" Not exactly privatization Veterans group agreed that Trump’s I.D. card plan would lead to more privatized care, but were divided on whether Kaine’s characterization of Trump’s plan was accurate. Paralyzed Veterans of America’s executive director Sherman Gillums Jr. criticized Trump’s proposal for ""completely privatizing"" the V.A. in a press release, but praised Trump’s attention to veterans issues. AMVETS spokesman John Hoellwarth called the proposal ""well-intentioned,"" but agreed that it was privatization and would be disastrous. ""Encouraging all veterans to seek care in the private sector, which lacks the expertise to treat military and combat injuries and illnesses, and which does not typically provide integrated or coordinated care, would lead to worse health outcomes for many veterans,"" Hoellwarth said. Veterans of Foreign Wars, meanwhile, considers the Trump’s idea partial privatization. ""Our concern is that a ‘go anywhere card’ leads to veterans receiving fragmented, uncoordinated, and lower-quality care, which is not what veterans have earned and deserve,"" said Joe Davis, the group’s director of public affairs. ""Private sector health care must complement, not compete with or supplant the VA health care system."" On the other end, Dan Caldwell, vice president for political and legislative action at Concerned Veterans for America (which is backed by the anti-Trump Koch brothers) said the group supports both choice and integration and disagreed vehemently with Kaine’s characterization. ""Giving veterans the choice of where to use their VA benefits does not necessitate the sale of VA hospitals to corporations nor does it eliminate government control of veterans’ health care,"" Caldwell said. ""Calling expanded health care choice for veterans ‘privatization’ is simply a poll-tested scare tactic."" Our ruling Kaine said, ""Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization of the V.A."" Actually, Trump is a guy who has called for giving veterans access to private providers. That may lead some veterans to seek care outside the V.A., but it’s not the same thing as completely privatizing the system.

""Have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who've been killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade and the number of Americans who've been killed by gun violence, and post those side by side on your news reports,"" he said in his address on the shooting. ""We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?"" Obama's underlying point was to highlight the lack of resources and legislative action taken on gun violence. Some have questioned the merit of such a comparison -- for example, critics have pointed out that cigarettes kill more people than guns. We're not weighing in on that debate. Rather, we're looking just at the data. Multiple outlets obliged (though each came up with slightly different numbers). Several readers asked us to check out one specific comparison widely shared on Facebook and Twitter. It was created by NowThis, a New York-based news company that produces content specifically for social media. The image says that 24 Americans have been killed by terrorism in the last decade, while 280,024 Americans were killed by guns. While NowThis’ numbers aren’t perfect, the overarching point is accurate. There have been far more deaths from gun violence than from terrorist attacks. Walking through the math Let’s start with the tally for terrorist-related deaths. NowThis senior editorial producer Versha Sharma told PolitiFact that the 24 figure refers to the number of U.S. citizens killed by terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, and does not include deaths abroad. Sharma acknowledged that this could have been made clear in the graphic. But she maintained that it’s more apt to compare domestic gun deaths to domestic terrorism deaths. Counting terrorist attacks abroad, she said, would make it an apples to oranges comparison. The number comes from the nonpartisan think tank the New America Foundation’s count of lethal jihadist attacks on U.S. soil from 2005 to 2015. It includes for example the four people killed during the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 and the 13 deaths from the Fort Hood shooting in 2009. To get to 280,024 gun deaths, NowThis compiled data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Vital Statistics System and the Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced project that tallies deaths and injuries in mass shootings. According to the CDC, the number of violent gun deaths between 2005 and 2013 (the latest year on record) was 279,976. That includes suicides, homicides, and police-related shootings. Mass Shooting Tracker counts 389 mass shooting gun deaths in 2014 and 375 so far in 2015. There are, however, a few issues with these numbers. For starters, a spokesperson for New America told us it would have been more accurate to include lives lost to both jihadist and non-jihadist extreme violence (47 deaths from 2005 to 2015) for a total count of 71 deaths from terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Secondly, Mass Shooting Tracker, as the name implies, only tracks deaths from mass shootings, defined by the group as when four more people are shot in an event. If we look at all gun-related deaths as the CDC does from the past two years, the numbers are much higher. According the nonprofit project the Gun Violence Archive, there were 12,562 gun deaths in 2014 and 9,959 in 2015 thus far. That’s a grand total of 301,797 firearm-related deaths in the past decade, compared to 71 deaths from domestic acts of terrorism. If we factor in terrorist attacks overseas, the comparison is still stark. From 2004 to 2014, 303 Americans were killed in terrorist attacks worldwide, according to State Department reports. During that same time frame, 320,523 Americans were killed because of gun violence. Here’s a breakdown:  Our ruling A viral image says the number of Americans killed by terrorism in the last decade is 24, while the number of Americans killed by guns in the last decade is 280,024.

Those claims headline a public service announcement airing statewide on television and radio in this season of merriment and cheer. ""Watch your speed. Put down the phone, and don’t get behind the wheel if you’ve been drinking,"" Gov. Nathan Deal warns listeners. For months, state officials have been alert to an unwelcome change: After falling annually for nine straight years, Georgia’s traffic deaths were up this year. But have more than 1,300 people really died this year on Georgia roads? And have 25 percent — or one out of four of those deaths — been caused by drunken driving, as the public service announcement says? PolitiFact Georgia decided to rev up the Truth-O-Meter. Figures compiled by the state Department of Transportation and released through the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety show traffic deaths in Georgia fell each year from 2005 to 2014, going from 1,729 to 1,170, even as U.S. census estimates show the state added about 1 million residents. Georgia roadway deaths for 2015 hit 1,345 as of Monday of this week. That's up 186, or 16 percent, from 2014, and it’s still a few days until we turn the calendar to 2016. According to state data, the 1,345 included six people killed in car-train collisions, 192 pedestrians, 138 motorcyclists and 21 bicyclists. The largest number of traffic deaths occurred on state and local roads, 675 and 485, respectively. But deaths on interstates — often the most visible because of the gridlock that follows — are up 21 percent, from 153 in 2014 to 185 so far this year. But were 25 percent of this year's fatalities alcohol-related? The answer: That could well be the case, but officials don’t know that with absolute certainty. Harris Blackwood, the director of the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety, said his agency has certified data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showing that 297 of Georgia’s 1,179 fatalities two years ago, or 25 percent, involved alcohol blood content of 0.08, the legal limit. Smaller amounts of alcohol — 0.01 percent or higher — were found in 30 percent, or 349, of those fatalities in 2013, Blackwood said. Part of the reason they don’t know for certain about the role of alcohol in 2015 traffic deaths is it can take months to obtain blood test results from the GBI crime lab, he said. ""However, there are indicators, such as open containers, information provided by other passengers, and so on,"" Blackwood said. ""The percentage of alcohol as a factor has been consistent on a percentage basis over a 10-year period, even as fatalities were going down prior to this year,"" he said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website gives an extensive five-year view of fatal crashes in Georgia and the nation — including the role alcohol plays. Between 2010 and 2014, alcohol-impaired driving was a factor in 24 percent to 25 percent of all fatal accidents each year. The one exception was 2011, when the percentage dropped to 22 percent. Nationally, 30 percent to 31 percent of all fatalities in those same five years involved alcohol-impaired drivers (those with a blood alcohol content of 0.08 or above), according to the NHTSA data. Blackwood said the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety also did a preliminary analysis early this year and found no evidence that ""the alcohol percentage is going down"" from prior years. In the first nine months of 2015, there were 483 instances where an officer requested an alcohol test or a driver refused an alcohol test, he said.

Young Liberian women are more likely to know how to read than be married.",Kate Wilkinson,"Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist and author Tina Rosenberg recently drew attention to a shocking statistic about women’s education in the African country of Liberia. ""This is education in Liberia,"" Rosenberg wrote in the New York Times on June 14. ""A girl is more likely to be married by 18 than to know how to read."" Liberia was devastated by civil war between 1989 and 2003. More recently, its schools were closed for six months following the outbreak of the Ebola virus in 2014. Our partners at Africa Check looked at the available survey data to determine the accuracy of Rosenberg’s claim. Recent data doesn’t support claim Rosenberg, who won the Pulitzer for non-fiction The Haunted Land: Facing Europe's Ghosts After Communism, told Africa Check that her claim was based on a Liberian database of statistics collected from the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). The database reported that 37.9 percent of children are married in Liberia by 18. That is fractionally higher than the female youth literacy rate of 37.2 percent, according to the UNICEF database. The problem is those figures come from 2007 reports and are out of date. The 37.9 percent figure for child marriage appears to track back to Liberia’s Demographic and Health Survey from 2007. The youth literacy figure is likely from a 2007 UNESCO Institute for Statistics’ estimate. The estimate covers women between the ages of 15-24, not just girls 18 and under. The most recent data comes from the country’s 2013 Demographic and Health Survey. Teen marriage rates in Liberia The Demographic and Health Survey presents data in five year increments for people aged 15 to 49. Women who are 18 fall into the youngest age group of 15 to 19. However, the survey is missing data for marriage rates for this age group. Instead, a United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund note on interpreting child marriage data recommends using the next age group: ""Looking at the group of women 20 to 24 years old is simpler and allows for the inclusion of all girls who were married or in union by age 18 within the closest time period for which complete data are available."" Following this standard, the 2013 Demographic and Health Survey shows that 35.9 percent of Liberian women aged 20 to 24 reported being married by the time they were 18. This method is imperfect because it doesn’t tell us about the chances that a girl under 20 today will have been married by 18. However, it gives us the best estimate for youth marriage rates for a group of young women who could reasonably be called girls. Literacy rates in Liberia The 2013 survey reported a literacy rate of 64.2 percent for women between 15 and 24 years of age. Someone is considered literate if they went to high school or if they can read a whole sentence or part of that sentence. The literacy rate decreases slightly to 58.9 percent when you look at women ages 20 to 24. Other organizations define literacy more strictly. For example, UNESCO doesn’t include people who can only read part of a sentence in the literate population. If we apply UNESCO’s literacy definition to Liberian women aged aged 20 to 24, literacy drops to 51.2 percent – still much higher than the marriage figure of 35.9 percent.

925,24949,John McCain Says Obama called Sarah Palin a pig.,"September 10, 2008","If there's lipstick on a pig, it's this McCain ad",Angie Drobnic Holan,"(Published Sept. 10, 2008) The story begins, like so many these days, with Gov. Sarah Palin’s speech at the Republican National Convention last week. Having stirred the crowd to its feet more than once, Palin delivered a knockout line when she deadpanned: “I love those hockey moms. You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick.” The line drew cheerful applause and has echoed ever since, which seems to explain how Sen. Barack Obama found himself in the middle of an uproar when he uttered a time-worn phrase to denigrate Sen. John McCain’s proclaimed agenda for “change” in Washington. ""John McCain says he's about change, too,"" Obama said. ""And so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out, George Bush! Except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy, and Karl Rove-style politics, we're really going to shake things up in Washington.'"" ""That's not change,"" Obama said. ""That's just calling something the same thing something different. But you know, you can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it’s still going to stink after eight years. We’ve had enough of the same old thing."" Gasp! He just said lipstick! Did he just call Sarah Palin a pig??!!! That’s the charge. Later that day, the McCain campaign arranged a conference call for reporters with Jane Swift, the former governor of Massachusetts. She said that when you add up Obama’s comments and Palin’s comments, you get Obama calling Palin a pig. Swift said Obama should apologize. “Calling a very prominent female governor of one of our states a ‘pig’ is not exactly what we want to see,” Swift said. The issue has dominated the presidential campaign for two days, with the McCain campaign stirring a controversy by having local lawmakers call for Obama to apologize, and the Obama campaign responding with examples of how often he and others have used the phrase. The next day, Obama called the McCain’s campaign tactics “lies and phony outrage and Swift-boat politics.” On Wednesday, the McCain campaign released a Web ad called “Lipstick.” It begins with a clip of Palin delivering her lipstick line, then text flashes on the screen saying “Barack Obama on: Sarah Palin.” A moment later, the ad plays a small portion of Obama’s “lipstick on a pig” remark, but not enough of his quotation to make clear what he was talking about. The ad concludes with a clip of CBS anchor Katie Couric soberly remarking on sexism on the campaign trail. The ad has two big problems, as does the complaint of former Gov. Swift. First, in the full text of the remarks it’s clear that Obama isn’t talking about Sarah Palin. He’s talking about McCain’s argument that he represents change. Second, “putting lipstick on a pig” is a popular put-down, especially among politicians. It generally means taking a bad or unattractive idea and trying to dress it up. We weren’t able to pin down the origins of this folksy expression, but we found tons of instances of people using it. The political newspaper  The Hill  labeled the phrase “Congress Speak” back in June, and gave it an official definition: “an expression used to illustrate that something unattractive cannot be beautified or otherwise positively changed by any amount of makeup or other exterior alterations.” In 1986, Texas Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower used the phrase to criticize Ronald Reagan’s farm policy. During the 2004 presidential campaign, both Dick Cheney and John Edwards used it to attack the other guy’s running mate. Earlier this year, Democratic Congresswoman Linda Sanchez of California gave a speech on trade policy. “You know the old saying about putting lipstick on a pig? Well, I smell bacon,” she groused. Obama and McCain both have used the expression. In September 2007,  Washington Post  columnist Eugene Robinson quoted Obama using the phrase to discuss Iraq policy: “I think that both Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are capable people who have been given an impossible assignment,” Obama said. “George Bush has given a mission to Gen. Petraeus, and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig.” In Iowa on Oct. 11, 2007, McCain panned Sen. Hillary Clinton’s health care plan, calling it “eerily reminiscent” of the plan that failed during Bill Clinton’s administration, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune. “I think they put some lipstick on a pig,” McCain said, “but it’s still a pig.” On Feb. 1, 2007, McCain blasted a Senate resolution that would have criticized President Bush’s strategy in Iraq. Some had praised the resolution as a compromise measure, but McCain disagreed. “It gets down to whether you support what is being done in this new strategy or you don’t,” McCain said. “You can put lipstick on a pig, [but] it’s still a pig, in my view.” It is simply impossible to view the complete remarks by Obama and conclude that he’s making a veiled and unsavory reference to Palin. Her name never is used in the preceding sentence. In fact, it’s hard to see how one could interpret Obama’s lipstick-on-a-pig remark as referring directly to McCain, either. We think it’s very clear that Obama was saying McCain’s effort to call himself the “candidate of change” is like putting lipstick on a pig, trying to dress up a bad idea to look better. Agree or disagree with Obama’s point, but his remark wasn’t the smear that McCain’s people have tried to make it. If anyone’s doing any smearing, it’s the McCain campaign and its outrageous attempt to distort the facts. Did Obama call Palin a pig? No, and saying so is  wrong.",false,"National, Candidate Biography, John McCain, "
927,1842,State high court rules NYC ban on large sodas is illegal.,"June 27, 2014",New Yorkers can now sip their super-sized sodas without worry.,Joseph Ax,"Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s plan to limit the sale of large sugary drinks was rejected on Thursday by the state’s highest court, which ruled the local health board overstepped its authority in approving the regulation. The 4-2 ruling from the state Court of Appeals upheld two lower court decisions from last year, siding with the soft drink, restaurant and movie theater industries, which had challenged the law. “By choosing among competing policy goals, without any legislative delegation or guidance, the Board engaged in law-making and thus infringed upon the legislative jurisdiction of the City Council,” wrote Judge Eugene Pigott for the majority. The law, which was struck down by a state judge in March 2013 one day before it was to take effect, would have barred restaurants, movie theaters and other businesses from selling sugary beverages larger than 16 ounces (473 ml). The decision Thursday ended the city’s final appeal, which was taken up by Bloomberg’s successor, Bill de Blasio. But the so-called “soda ban” remained closely associated with Bloomberg, who had previously banned cigarettes from parks and bars and trans fats from restaurants in a broad effort to combat public health problems through regulation. The soda ban, the first of its kind in the United States, drew national attention, with critics blasting Bloomberg’s “nanny state” and public health advocates praising the attempt to fight obesity. In a statement, de Blasio said he was disappointed but that officials have a “responsibility to address the causes of this epidemic.”  A spokesman for the American Beverage Association, which led the legal challenge and includes members like PepsiCo Inc, The Coca-Cola Co and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc, said the law “would have created an uneven playing field for thousands of small businesses in the city and limited New Yorkers’ freedom of choice.”  Steve Anastos, the manager of City Diner on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, said he supported the decision because “people can drink whatever they want.”  The court focused on the law’s loopholes, which exempted businesses not subject to the health board’s authority and left untouched certain drinks, such as milk-based beverages. As a result convenience stores such as 7-Eleven, which sells a 64-ounce Big Gulp drink, were unaffected. Likewise, high-calorie coffee drinks like Starbucks’ Frappuccinos remained exempt from the ban. The decision could also curtail the board’s power in the future to enact sweeping health initiatives. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Susan Read said the health board acted properly and any challenge belonged in the political arena, not the courts. “What petitioners have truly asked the courts to do is to strike down an unpopular regulation, not an illegal one,” she wrote. “But if that is so, eliminating, limiting, or preventing it via political means should present little obstacle.”",true,Health News

Some patients who buy health insurance through the exchange could lose access to their current doctor, but it’s difficult to predict how many.",Amy Sherman,"Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., calls Obamacare a ""broken and failed experiment."" In an interview with Fox’s Sean Hannity on July 31, Rubio railed against the health care law, saying it would hurt regular folks. ""Just think about the people that have health insurance now, and they’re happy with it. They’re going to lose that health insurance. They have a doctor they’ve been seeing for the last 15 or 20 years, they won’t be able to keep going to that doctor,"" he said. Rubio’s claim that insured patients will have to stop seeing their long-time doctors caught our attention, so we decided to check it out. We asked a Rubio spokesman for an explanation and did not get a response. Even without Obamacare patients sometimes have to switch doctors If we set aside the health care law, there are already ways that people can end up losing access to their doctor now. Companies can switch health care plans, and some employees’ doctors may not be in the new network. Employees can lose their job -- or switch jobs -- and end up with a different plan that doesn’t include the same doctor. Switching jobs -- and therefore, potentially health insurance -- can happen often. In 2012, the median job tenure was 5.4 years, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. ""It's hard to imagine many people on the same health plan for 15-20 years given natural job turnover,"" said Paul Fronstin, senior research associate at Employee Benefit Research Institute. The health care law leaves in place the current health insurance system, so switching plans and possibly doctors will still happen. The law also puts more requirements on insurance companies, so that they have to offer more comprehensive coverage. For people who are uninsured or have to buy insurance on their own, the law creates state-by-state health insurance exchanges where people can buy their own insurance. These new options mean people may end up switching health plans, and that could mean switching doctors. But experts on the health care law told us it’s difficult to predict how many will fall into that category. There are many factors at play, including the particular insurance plan, geography and if the patient shops for a plan on the exchange. ""Most people are not going to be affected, at least in the short term,"" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. ""Will it be huge numbers? Probably not. Will some people find they can’t keep their current doctor? Yes."" If Rubio wants to protect people from involuntary changes in their doctors, ""the best remedy is to abandon the current employer-based insurance system and to provide insurance on some other basis -- e.g., a single-insurer system of the kind they have in Canada,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. Now let’s examine the possibilities as it relates to Obamacare: • Employers that offer health insurance: It’s possible that employers will switch their health care plans and that a new plan won’t include some employees’ current doctors in network. But that was already the case before Obamacare. ""If the ACA results in more employers switching plans, it is possible that more people will be in a situation where their new plan isn't in the network, but I've seen nothing that quantifies this,"" Fronstin said. It’s also possible that some large employers could decide to drop their plan and pay the penalty, forcing employees to buy insurance from the exchanges. Also, a small employer who won’t face a penalty could drop their plan, sending workers to the exchanges. But industry experts are not expecting the changes to be particularly widespread. Barry Schilmeister, a health care actuary and senior consultant at Mercer, said that ""it's not likely that employers will be making a lot more carrier changes than in the past, if they're keeping their traditional programs (which most are, for now)."" • Exchanges: A patient’s current doctor may not be available through some -- or potentially any -- of the plans offered on the exchanges. There are lots of different scenarios here. A patient’s doctor might be on an exchange plan, but the consumer might choose a cheaper alternative instead that doesn’t cover that doctor. If that consumer truly couldn’t afford the plan covering their doctor, we might call that being ""forced"" to switch doctors, but if someone simply chooses to save money, then they are making a choice. Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said that there is some truth to Rubio’s claim, because there is the potential for some patients to lose access to their doctor. But she said at this point, it’s not possible to predict how many people that will happen to in the first year of the exchange -- or beyond. ""Just like private plans now don’t include all the doctors, many doctors may not choose to be in the plans offered in the exchanges,"" she told PolitiFact. That ""will depend on which companies participate in the exchanges, whether they have a relationship with those plans, and the payment rates that the plan will use for the exchange. Many states have pushed plan premiums way below what the companies thought it would take and may come in with narrow networks to live within those rates."" News reports indicate that some health care insurance companies are forgoing some state exchanges, at least for now. Aetna announced Aug. 2 that it was pulling out of Maryland’s individual exchange. We interviewed spokespersons at a few health care companies and learned that United Health plans to participate in about a dozen exchanges, while Aetna plans to join about 14. Cigna currently offers individual plans in 10 states and has chosen half for initial participation in exchanges. This means for consumers who now have a particular insurance company and have to buy a plan on the exchange, ""whether your doctor might be on other plans is a crapshoot -- maybe yes, maybe no,"" Wilensky said. • Medicare: Jeff Johnson, state director of Florida AARP, said that nothing in the Affordable Care Act would force patients on Medicare to switch doctors. Future changes to Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors ""could affect doctors getting out of Medicare."" However, that has been an issue years before Obamacare. The ""sustainable growth rate"" passed into law under President Bill Clinton is supposed to set Medicare reimbursement costs but is routinely bypassed by Congress. ""The Affordable Care Act did not include a permanent fix to that,"" he said. Judith Stein, executive director of Center for Medicare Advocacy, said every year doctors decide whether to continue serving patients on Medicare or Medicare Advantage -- and that’s unrelated to Obamacare. With Medicare Advantage, doctors consider how many of their patients are on the plan, reimbursement rates and administrative hassles ""It may be your Medicare Advantage plan may not include your doctor next year, but not because of Obamacare. ... That has always been the case and continues to be the case."" Our ruling Rubio said that for people who currently have health insurance, ""They have a doctor they’ve been seeing for the last 15 or 20 years, they won’t be able to keep going to that doctor,"" due to Obamacare. Rubio ignores the fact that without Obamacare, patients can lose access to their doctor when their employer switches plans or they switch (or lose) jobs. Some patients who buy health insurance through the exchange could lose access to their current doctor, but it’s difficult to predict how many.

931,33849,The Titanic went to a watery grave carrying a cursed mummy in its hold. ,"October 10, 1999","In case you’re curious (and have some vacation time to spare), the coffin lid of the Priestess of Amun is still on display at the British Museum, just as it was when Stead and Murray created their infamous “cursed mummy” tale a century ago. Look for exhibit BM No. 22542, in the Second Egyptian Room.",David Mikkelson,"The following tale sends chills down your spine, doesn’t it? Of all tales of the supernatural, this one is perhaps the best documented, the most disturbing and the most difficult to explain …  The Princess of Amen-Ra lived some 1,500 years before Christ. When she died, she was laid in an ornate wooden coffin and buried deep in a vault at Luxor, on the banks of the Nile. In the late 1890s, 4 rich young Englishmen visiting the excavations at Luxor were invited to buy an exquisitely fashioned mummy case containing the remains of Princess of Amen-Ra. They drew lots. The man who won paid several thousand pounds and had the coffin taken to his hotel. A few hours later, he was seen walking out towards the desert. He never returned. The next day, one of the remaining 3 men was shot by an Egyptian servant accidentally. His arm was so severely wounded it had to be amputated. The third man in the foursome found on his return home that the bank holding his entire savings had failed. The fourth guy suffered a severe illness, lost his job and was reduced to selling matches in the street. Nevertheless, the coffin reached England (causing other misfortunes along the way), where it was bought by a London businessman. After 3 of his family members had been injured in a road accident and his house damaged by fire, the businessman donated it to the British Museum. As the coffin was being unloaded from a truck in the museum courtyard, the truck suddenly went into reverse and trapped a passerby. Then as the casket was being lifted up the stairs by 2 workmen, 1 fell and broke his leg. The other, apparently in perfect health, died unaccountably two days later. Once the Princess was installed in the Egyptian Room, trouble really started. The Museum’s night watchmen frequently heard frantic hammering and sobbing from the coffin. Other exhibits in the room were also often hurled about at night. One watchman died on duty; making the other watchmen wanting to quit. Cleaners refused to go near the Princess too. When a visitor derisively flicked a dustcloth at the face painted on the coffin, his child died of measles soon afterwards. Finally, the authorities had the mummy carried down to the basement figuring it could not do any harm down there. Within a wk, one of the helpers was seriously ill, and the supervisor of the move was found dead on his desk. By now, the papers had heard of it. A journalist photographer took a picture of the mummy case and when he developed it, the painting on the coffin was of a horrifying, human face. The photographer was said to have gone home then, locked his bedroom door and shot himself. Soon afterwards, the museum sold the mummy to a private collector. After continual misfortune (and deaths), the owner banished it to the attic. A well known authority on the occult, Madame Helena Blavatsky, visited the premises. Upon entry, she was sized with a shivering fit and searched the house for the source of an evil influence of incredible intensity; She finally came to the attic and found the mummy case. Can you exorcise this evil spirit? Asked the owner. There is no such thing as exorcism. Evil remains evil forever. Nothing can be done about it. I implore you to get rid of this evil as soon as possible. But no British museum would take the mummy; the fact that almost 20 people had met with misfortune, disaster or death from handling the casket, in barely 10 years, was now well known. Eventually, a hardheaded American archaeologist (who dismissed the happenings as quirks of circumstance), paid a handsome price for the mummy and arranged for its removal to New York. In Apr 1912, the new owner escorted its treasure aboard a sparkling, new White Star liner about to make its maiden voyage to New York. On the night of April 14, amid scenes of unprecedented horror, the Princess of Amen-Ra accompanied 1,500 passengers to their deaths at the bottom of the Atlantic. The name of the ship was of course, the H.M.S. TITANIC [sic]. Ah, but it’s only a ghost story: no mummy (cursed or otherwise) was carried as cargo by the ill-fated RMS Titanic on its one and only voyage. First of all, the tale is logically inconsistent. One of the few names quoted in the piece is that of Helena Blavatsky, a well-known occultist of the period. And we’re told the dreaded Princess of Amen-Ra was purchased in Luxor, Egypt, by four foolish young Englishmen “in the late 1890s,” while later in the same piece we’re informed of Helena Blavatsky’s dire pronouncements to the private collector who supposedly had possession of the mummy right before it was shipped on the Titanic. These claims cannot both be true, because Helena Blavatsky died of influenza in 1891, but the Titanic‘s first and only voyage didn’t take place until 1912. As for the facts of the matter, in 1985, Charles Haas, president of the national Titanic Historical Society, gained access to the ship’s cargo manifest and cargo diagrams. Though the cargo included raw feathers, linen, straw, hatter’s fur, tissue, auto parts, leather, rabbit hair, elastics, hair nets and refrigerating apparatus, not so much as one mummy was listed. Speaking to the legend that a cursed mummy was on board, Haas said, “The cargo manifest throws those myths right out the window.”   Other experts have come to the same conclusion: no mummy — least of all one “of the vengeful Princess of Amen-Ra” — was shipped aboard the Titanic. (Of course, the fact that the ship’s manifest listed no gold and no insurance claims were filed for valuable gems hasn’t stopped people from believing that those objects went down with the Titanic as well.) Note that “Amen-Ra” isn’t the name of a place; it’s the name of an Egyptian god, one whose name means “the hidden one”. He was seen as the creator of all things and, with his consort Mut and their son the moon-god Khonshu, was worshipped in the great temples of Luxor and Karnak. In fact, the mummy to which this story refers (which was actually just the coffin lid, not the mummy, of the Priestess of Amun) never left the British Museum, and it is still there to this day. So how did this fanciful tale begin? This ghost story was concocted around the turn of the century by two Englishmen named William Stead and Douglas Murray. Stead was a well-known journalist and editor who crusaded on behalf of liberal causes and created a national scandal when he published an article entitled “The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon,” describing how he was able to purchase the services of a thirteen-year-old prostitute for £5. Stead was also a believer  in mysticism and spiritualism who consulted mediums, investigated psychic phenomena,  and published a related periodical. We don’t know much about Murray — he’s been described as an “Egyptologist” and as the man who shipped the mummy in question to London in the first place, although he was probably neither. Stead and Murray crafted an elaborate horror story about a mummy that was brought to England and set up in the drawing room of an acquaintance of theirs. The morning after the mummy arrived, they claimed, everything breakable in the room was destroyed. The mummy was moved from room to room within the house, but each move resulted in the same destruction of all the breakable objects at hand. Wherever the mummy went, it brought sickness, death and destruction to its owner. Sometime after Stead and Murray invented their mummy tale, they were visiting the First Egyptian Room of the British Museum and noticed the coffin lid of the Priestess of Amun. They concocted yet another story that the look of terror and anguish in the face depicted on the coffin lid indicated that the coffin’s original occupant was a tormented soul, and her evil spirit was now loose in the world. Stead and Murray told their fanciful tale to eager newspaper reporters who — then as now — weren’t about to let the truth get in the way of a sensationally good story. The two stories were conflated into one and spread widely, and the Priestess of Amun came to be identified as the mummy whose mortal remains wreaked havoc wherever they were stored. This ghost story made the leap from London to the Titanic after William Stead went down with the ill-fated ship on 15 April 1912. Stead was traveling to America at President Taft’s request to address a peace conference, and he took delight in relating his “cursed mummy” tale to Titanic passengers. He reportedly defied superstition by starting his narrative at a dinner party on Friday, the 12th of April, and drew it out so that he concluded the tale just after midnight on the 13th. A few days after the Titanic‘s sinking, one of the survivors recounted Stead’s “cursed mummy” tale in an interview with the New York World, and eventually the ghost story Stead and Murray invented, Stead’s presence aboard the Titanic, and reports of Stead’s having related the mummy tale to Titanic passengers became jumbled together, producing a new legend about an actual mummy aboard the Titanic. The modified legend told of a cursed mummy the British Museum was so anxious to be rid of that they sold it to an American, who naturally sought to ship it back home via the Titanic. The presence of the cursed mummy (which had escalated the expressions of its wrath from breaking cups and saucers and making people ill to sinking passenger liners) in the Titanic‘s hold came to be whispered as the cause of the most famous maritime disaster in history. In an even more elaborate version of the legend, the mummy’s American owner paid a bribe to have the mummy placed in one of the Titanic‘s lifeboats; it was then smuggled aboard the Carpathia when that ship picked up the Titanic‘s survivors and secretly landed in New York. When the mummy continued to wreak havoc at its new home, its new owner had it taken to Canada in preparation for shipping it back to England. The mummy was placed aboard the liner Empress of Ireland, which, while on its way from Quebec City to Liverpool on 29 May 1914, was struck by a Norwegian coal ship. The Empress of Ireland sank so quickly that only 7 of her 40 lifeboats could be launched, and 840 passengers went down with her. As to how widespread this “curse of the mummy” stuff is, some of the crew members on a failed 1980 expedition to locate the sunken Titanic spoke darkly of the famous mummy that was allegedly on board her, saying it transferred the curse of all who disturbed its grave to the vessel’s maiden voyage and all subsequent search efforts. (Yeah. Like it couldn’t have been plain bad luck. And what was the mummy doing back on the Titanic after having sailed on the Empress of Ireland?) In looking to blame their bad luck on an outside force they couldn’t possibly have hoped to defeat, those crew members weren’t all that unusual. They merely brought into play a standard avoidance technique employed to keep us from having to confront what a scary, random world this place can be. In the wake of any disaster, there’s a strong urge to explain away the tragedy by ascribing it to some dark power beyond our control. As inconceivable as this might seem at first blush, it’s easier for many people to accept that a cursed mummy was the cause of great loss of life than it is to co-exist with the knowledge that sometimes even unthinkable accidents will happen. Being at the mercy of the God of Random Chance is far more frightening a reality to face than any vengeful mummy will ever be. Ghost stories like this one reaffirm our faith in the world being a predictable (and therefore safe) place. If a great tragedy such as the sinking of the Titanic can be explained away as the direct result of the evil forces of the supernatural’s being stirred up, we can again feel safe about placing our faith in the inherent safety of great ships, airplanes or even automobiles. Beyond the reassurance factor, such tales also make darned good storytelling. That too lies at the heart of their appeal.",false,"Horrors, Supernatural Tales, titanic"
934,9204,Personalized treatment for those in blood pressure 'gray zone',"January 23, 2017","This news release describes an analysis of data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study showing a link between a buildup of calcium in coronary arteries and heart attacks in patients with borderline high blood pressure, referred to here as “prehypertension.” The study asserts that coronary artery calcification (CAC) can be used to guide treatment decisions for these “gray zone” patients. Aside from an overreaching headline and sub-headline, the news release delivers essential information including costs, harms, availability, and study limitations. Nearly 30 percent of U.S. adults have prehypertension, defined as blood pressure between 120 and 139 for the first number (systolic) and/or 80 to 89 for the second number (diastolic). Preypertension is associated with a higher risk of heart attack as well as a heightened risk of developing high blood pressure, which increases the risk of stroke. But the concept of “prehypertension” is somewhat controversial. The most recent hypertension guidelines (JNC 8) do not include this classification. It’s still a leap of faith to imply that identifying this risk group and more aggressively treating their blood pressure would significantly reduce their cardiovascular risk. Patients generally are advised to make lifestyle changes such as exercise and weight loss, but medication is sometimes prescribed. A tool to better determine which patients would benefit from aggressive treatment — as coronary artery calcification scans might prove to be — could help clinicians make better recommendations, improving outcomes and reducing costs.","Mary Chris Jaklevic,Richard Hoffman, MD,Kathlyn Stone","The news release says that coronary artery calcium scans “aren’t usually covered by insurance and can range in cost from $100 to $400.” The news release does a good job of explaining the findings with numbers. It says the study shows “heart CT scans can help personalize treatment in patients whose blood pressure falls in the gray zone of just above normal or mild high blood pressure.” It says the study suggests “people with the highest calcium levels would benefit most from aggressive blood pressure treatment, whereas those with little or no calcium may not need to be treated as intensively, depending on their other heart disease risk factors.” It gives some detailed numbers to show the risk differential between people with no calcium buildup and those with a lot of calcium. To paraphrase the release, among participants with borderline blood pressure readings, those with calcium scores of zero and high predicted risk of heart disease had a low actual event rate, of 12.7 events per 1,000 person-years. Those with calcium scores over 100 but a low predicted risk of heart disease ended up with a higher rate of actual cardiac events, 19.7. “Thus,” the release says, “even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment. Given that the difference in cardiac event rates between people with low calcium scores and those with high calcium scores isn’t extreme, this might amount to a marginal benefit; we would have liked some discussion of how many patients might fall into this “gray zone” and thus benefit from this approach. Basically, the benefits, including the number needed to treat (NNT), cost-effectiveness, as well as harms and costs of obtaining these calcium scores are unknown. All we know is the magnitude of the increased potential risk associated with higher calcium scores, not whether this risk can be reduced. The news release states: “The scans use radiation, so there is a very small cancer risk for susceptible individuals.” While the mention of cancer risk is laudable, we aren’t clear what’s meant by “susceptible individuals.” Also, it does not mention that CT scans are not recommended for pregnant women due to possible risk to the fetus. In addition, harms can also arise from medications prescribed to treat these calcium scores. The news release is forthcoming about study limitations. It states: “The researchers caution that results are from an observational study, and a randomized trial would be needed to confirm the recommendations.” While other limitations are mentioned in the study, these are key ones readers should know about. The news release is accurate when it states that nearly one in three adults in the US. has the range of blood pressure it describes as prehypertension. But we wonder why it mentions that 70 million adults in the U.S. have high blood pressure, since the study results do not directly apply to that population. The news release mentions who funded the study, but it omits one potential conflict of interest that was reported in the study: one of the authors serves on a speakers’ bureau for GE Healthcare, which makes imaging equipment and software designed to detect coronary artery calcification. It’s not a a major concern, but the lack of disclosure means the release doesn’t quite meet our standard here. The news release offers this comparison: “Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don’t need.” Previous treatment guidelines (JNC 7) recommended only lifestyle changes for the average-risk prehypertensive patient. (And as noted above, the current guidelines do not include a prehypertensive category.) We would like to see some mention of these recommended lifestyle changes such as exercise, weight loss, dietary changes, and limiting alcohol, which can reduce blood pressure along with providing other health benefits. Though CT scans are widely available, the news release mentions that coronary artery calcium scans aren’t usually covered by insurance. This seems to be an important stumbling block to widespread adoption. Could insurers be persuaded to pay for scans if the cost is outweighed by better targeting of treatments? Addressing this point would have added value to the news release. The news release offers perspective via this quote from a researcher: “Our study, along with others, such as SPRINT and HOPE, positions cardiac risk and coronary artery calcium as helpful ways to determine if a given patient would either benefit from more intensive blood pressure control or do just fine with a more traditional blood pressure target.” According to the study itself, it’s the “first to incorporate information on individual coronary artery calcium (CAC) burden to personalize the risk-based treatment of hypertension.” It should be noted that the release is comparing an observational study with the HOPE and SPRINT trials which were randomized treatment trials. The former examines an association while the latter provides experimental evidence. This is a close call. Overall the tone of this news release is measured. However, the sub-headline jumps the gun when it states the CAC score “gives risk assessment to prevent over- or undertreatment of blood pressure.” The score may be able to help guide treatment decisions when the path is unclear, but as the body of the news release mentions, a randomized trial is needed to find out whether there’s a clinical benefit. Also, we’re wondering whether the term “personalized treatment” is overused. In the past it’s typically referred to treatment approaches directed by genetic variables. But in this case, the term has been expanded to cover variables in calcium buildup, with no known genetic component. The release also states: “the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient.”  At best, this provides the rationale for conducing a study to determine whether blood pressure treatment is appropriate–it cannot address the issue of which strategy.",true,"blood pressure,Johns Hopkins Medicine,prehypertension"

Trump charged that Democratic intransigence about how to renew Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was preventing an agreement on federal spending that would keep the government open — including the country’s defense forces. ""Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards,"" Trump tweeted on Jan. 12, 2018. ""The Dems will threaten ‘shutdown,’ but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" ....Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten “shutdown,” but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! We won’t wade into the question of who would be to blame for the shutdown. However, we wondered whether Trump was correct that a government shutdown is tantamount to ""shutting down our military."" When we checked with the White House, they said that Trump was not using the term literally, to suggest that the entire military will cease to operate. In other tweets, Trump used less sweeping language. In one, for instance, he warned against moves that would ""stop paying our troops and government workers."" Still, the less cautiously worded tweet attracted nearly 23,000 retweets and almost 91,000 likes, so we thought it was worth a closer look. What is a shutdown? Federal government shutdowns occur when spending bills expire, and Congress and the president find themselves at an impasse. A law known as the Antideficiency Act requires suspending a federal agency’s operations until an appropriation bill is enacted. But there is some leeway to continue certain federal activities deemed essential. A two-week shutdown occurred most recently in 2013, when Barack Obama was president, Democrats controlled the Senate, and Republicans controlled the House. Prior to that, there were two shutdowns in the mid 1990s, when President Bill Clinton squared off against a new Republican majority in the House and Senate. One was for five days in November 1995, and the other was for 21 days, from December 1995 to January 1996. Who works and who doesn’t During the 2013 shutdown, as many as 850,000 workers were furloughed per day, or about 40 percent of the federal workforce (not counting active-duty military personnel and U.S. Postal Service workers). The longstanding guidance is that ""employees who are performing emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property"" remain on their jobs during a shutdown. The determination of who works and who doesn’t has traditionally been made by senior executives and legal advisors at each agency. This means that the president, as the head of the executive branch, could theoretically order which federal workers must continue to show up for work, said Stan Collender, a budget specialist at the consulting firm Qorvis MSLGROUP. During a shutdown, national parks typically shut their doors, government-funded scientific research is halted, and various health and safety inspections — by agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration — are put on hold. (Some government functions are not reliant on congressional appropriations, and these can usually continue unimpeded in the face of a shutdown.) But workers responsible for human safety and security will typically remain on the job, and that includes many members of the military. How the military is affected Active-duty military personnel have always been required to work through shutdowns. Army troops don’t abandon their posts and naval ships don’t all return to port. In addition, many civilian workers in the Defense Department have been required to work through shutdowns. Other civilian workers in the Defense Department, however, hold jobs that do not meet the urgency threshold to keep working. In 2013, the government furloughed about half of its civilian workers, or about 400,000 employees, leaving a patchwork of various permissible and impermissible activities, according to Federal News Radio. ""We can and will continue to support key military operations,"" former Defense Department comptroller Bob Hale told Federal News Radio in 2013. ""We’re allowed to do that by law, but the law would force us to disrupt many of our support activities. We wouldn’t be able to do most training, we couldn’t enter into most new contracts, routine maintenance would have to stop, and we couldn’t continue efforts to improve contracting and financial management including our audit improvement efforts."" The Defense Department, like other parts of the government, will experience some consequences from a shutdown. But experts we interviewed agreed that Trump’s language in this tweet amounted to an exaggeration, especially because the Defense Department is hurt less by a shutdown than most agencies. ""All critical military functions will continue,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""There would be some wrinkles, but nothing like other areas of government."" Todd Harrison, a defense budget specialist with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the ""biggest impact is probably on defense contractors, who will have to stop working."" But ""troops that are in harm’s way overseas will continue operating as normal and won’t be at any increased risk,"" he said. Paychecks could be delayed One way that even active-duty troops could feel the shutdown is in their wallets. Employees who are required to work are not paid until a new spending bill is passed— effectively working for free, at least temporarily. Workers who are furloughed have historically been compensated for back pay through subsequent congressional action, though there is no requirement that such a bill be passed. In 2013, the Office of Management and Budget estimated that $2.5 billion in pay and benefits was paid for hours not worked government-wide, said Tyler Evilsizer, research manager for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Usually, paychecks have been sent after a shutdown is over, but for the Defense Department in 2013, Congress and the president agreed to a bill in the middle of the shutdown that paid all active-duty and many civilian Defense Department employees. This enabled Defense Department employees to return to work while the shutdown was still going on for workers in other departments. Delayed paychecks are just one downside of government shutdowns. ""A shutdown is a huge waste of taxpayer dollars, disruptive of government operations, and simply bad management,"" said John Palguta, a former federal human-resources official who is now an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Public Policy Institute. ""A shutdown, however, will not put the U.S. in harm’s way by shutting down our military."" Even just planning contingencies for a possible shutdown divert time and effort from the government’s duties, said Mallory Barg Bulman, vice president of research and evaluation at the Partnership for Public Service. Our ruling Trump said that in a government shutdown, ""what they are really doing is shutting down our military."" This is an exaggeration. Based on historical precedent, the Defense Department does stand to see a substantial fraction of its civilian workers furloughed, and employee morale would likely suffer if paychecks are held back. But experts agreed that core military functions would remain operational, including all active-duty military personnel and many essential civilian workers.

938,9755,"Surprising news about teens, marijuana, and health issues. It’s all good.","August 6, 2015","The story describes one study of about 400 men who were followed from their teens in the late 1980s until 2010. The researchers found no increased risk of asthma, depression, lung cancer or mental illness, which the story seems to accept as a big reassurance. We felt the story did not squarely address the study limitations as described by the authors themselves in the paper. Instead, the “surprising news” came in a single-source story, lifting quotes from a news release, without any independent perspective or adequate context. Millions of individuals, of all ages, are making current decisions about medical and recreational marijuana use every day. Medical research on the health impacts of that exposure matter for each person and for society as a whole. This story over-valued the conclusion of a single small study based on a sample of only young men. Yes, the study results were interesting and indeed add to a body of knowledge about the use of marijuana by adolescents but it is by no means definitive. Suggesting, “it’s all good” is a misleading leap based on this one limited study.","Sally James,Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Gary Schwitzer","We’ll rule this Not Applicable. The story didn’t discuss costs, and we acknowledge it would be difficult to pin down marijuana costs from different sources – from the time period in question in the analysis – or today. Although the story is about research examining harms we think that a brief line or two about the reasons for marijuana use would have been informative. Especially when the author is allowed to say that he wanted to “help inform the debate about legalization of marijuana.”  Debates involve tradeoffs of benefits and harms and we heard only one side of it in this story (and incompletely at that). The story provides a list of the potential harms associated with marijuana use but it over-emphasizes the importance of this relatively small study in downplaying them – calling it “surprising news” that is “all good” in the headline. And the second sentence says the study “should alleviate some of the worst fears.”  That is too big a leap. The story tried to describe the context of previous studies on marijuana but used this language “other studies in the past that seemed to allude to marijuana use and later development of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations.” As readers, we want to ask – did previous studies conclude there were risks? How can a study “seem to allude?” A recent review (N Engl J Med 2014; 370:2219-222) cited 69 publications examining the potential harms of marijuana use by the general population. This one study is simply an addition to the growing body of evidence. The story provides several hints into the study design. We are told how many subjects were enrolled and the duration of the data collection. We are also told that the 408 really represented 4 separate and distinct groups based on usage with the early chronic users highlighted. This latter group was represented by 86 subjects. The implication is that these young men ingested a good deal of marijuana. Usage was not however uniform. The methods of assessing the presence of absence of the harms under study are not provided (of note: 25 of the original subjects died during the study period with 21 deaths listed as homicides) nor are we told about missing data. The study was conducted only in male teens, so the headline or early sentence should have emphasized the limitation that the “surprising” findings apply only to one gender. This single study relies solely on the reports of the participants and ended in 2010 – based on their reported use of marijuana in the 1980s and 90s. Many observers believe the marijuana sold in the United States has changed dramatically in the past 25 years. Results on exposures from so long ago may not apply to modern marijuana strains for sale. Here’s how one laboratory representative described the potency change, in a CBS story from earlier this year. “We’ve seen a big increase in marijuana potency compared to where it was 20 or 30 years ago,” lab founder and director of research Andy LaFrate, Ph.D., said in a video released by ACS. Based on testing in laboratory equipment, “I would say the average potency of marijuana has probably increased by a factor of at least three. We’re looking at average potencies right now of around 20 percent THC.” THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the psychoactive compound in marijuana that acts on the brain to produce the feeling of being high. Not applicable in this case. There was not a single disease or condition explored in any detail. The story badly needed an independent source. It would have been possible and helpful to choose from among many researchers whose work points to potential harm from chronic marijuana exposure. Again, letting the researcher get away with saying – unchallenged- that he wanted to “help inform the debate about legalization of marijuana” in a single source story is problematic. This is not an applicable category for this story topic. However, it is interesting to consider whether teens who use marijuana are not using alcohol, and whether that may lower their risk of harms from alcohol use. The story leads with the “widespread availability of marijuana in recent years” – especially “thanks to its legalization in a growing number of states.” The story suggests that the study highlighted was novel in that it did not find an association between marijuana use in adolescent and harms seen by other researchers. However, the story did little to provide any context to the differences. Since the intent of this criterion is to establish the true novelty of a finding, we judge the story to be unsatisfactory. The quotes from researcher Bechtold are identical to those in an American Psychological Association news release. The story euphemistically refers to these comments appearing in “a statement.”  Let’s call it what it is:  a news release or press release written by public relations people. Lifting quotes and then not seeking independent perspectives are a double whammy.",false,"marijuana,teens"
939,27560,"Nazi Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering  proclaimed that although ""the people don't want war,""  they ""can always be brought to the bidding of their leaders.","October 4, 2002","We note that the validity of this quote is based upon a single source’s report of a private comment (and therefore cannot be independently verified), but it is the only possible source, and Gustave Gilbert was a respected psychologist with no obvious motivation to fabricate a tale such as this. Some sixty-five years on, Gilbert’s book The Psychology of Dictatorship: Based on an Examination of the Leaders of Nazi Germany is still a highly regarded entry in its field.",David Mikkelson,"Another quote in the vein of the apocryphal Julius Caesar warning about political leaders who can all too easily send the citizenry marching eagerly off to war by manufacturing crises that purportedly threaten national security and making popular appeals to patriotism. In this case the sentiment expressed is even more disturbing because it comes not from a venerated figure of antiquity, but supposedly from a reviled twentieth-century figure associated with the most chilling example of genocide in human history: Hermann Goering, Nazi Reichsmarshall and Luftwaffe-Chief:  “Of course the people don’t want war. But after all, it’s the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it’s always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it’s a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them  they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger.” — Herman Goering at the Nuremberg trials  We may be made somewhat uneasy by the idea that the head of a classic civilization recognized 2,000 years ago that the populace could be manipulated into sacrificing themselves in wars at the whims of their leaders, but perhaps we’re more outraged (and maybe even scared) at the thought of a fat Nazi fascist flunky’s recognizing and telling us the same thing. The notable difference here is that although the Caesar quote is a latter-day fabrication, the words attributed to Hermann Goering are real. Goering was one of the highest-ranking Nazis who survived to be captured and put on trial for war crimes in the city of Nuremberg by the Allies after the end of World War II. He was found guilty on charges of “war crimes,” “crimes against peace,” and “crimes against humanity” by the Nuremberg tribunal and sentenced to death by hanging. The sentence could not be carried out, however, because Goering committed suicide with smuggled cyanide capsules hours before his execution, scheduled for 15 October 1946. The quote cited above does not appear in transcripts of the Nuremberg trials because although Goering spoke these words during the course of the proceedings, he did not offer them at his trial. His comments were made privately to Gustave Gilbert, a German-speaking American intelligence officer and psychologist who was granted free access by the Allies to all the prisoners held in the Nuremberg jail. Gilbert kept a journal of his observations of the proceedings and his conversations with the prisoners, which he later published in the book Nuremberg Diary. The quote offered above was part of a conversation Gilbert held with a dejected Hermann Goering in his cell on the evening of 18 April 1946, as the trials were halted for a three-day Easter recess:  Sweating in his cell in the evening, Goering was defensive and deflated and not very happy over the turn the trial was taking. He said that he had no control over the actions or the defense of the others, and that he had never been anti-Semitic himself, had not believed these atrocities, and that several Jews had offered to testify in his behalf. If [Hans] Frank [Governor-General of occupied Poland] had known about atrocities in 1943, he should have come to him and he would have tried to do something about it. He might not have had enough power to change things in 1943, but if somebody had come to him in 1941 or 1942 he could have forced a showdown. (I still did not have the desire at this point to tell him what [SS General Otto] Ohlendorf  had said to this: that Goering had been written off as an effective “moderating” influence, because of his drug addiction and corruption.) I pointed out that with his “temperamental utterances,” such as preferring the killing of 200 Jews to the destruction of property, he had hardly set himself up as champion of minority rights. Goering protested that too much weight was being put on these temperamental utterances. Furthermore, he made it clear that he was not defending or glorifying Hitler. Later in the conversation, Gilbert recorded Goering’s observations that the common people can always be manipulated into supporting and fighting wars by their political leaders:  We got around to the subject of war again and I said that, contrary to his attitude, I did not think that the common people are very thankful for leaders who bring them war and destruction. “Why, of course, the people don’t want war,” Goering shrugged. “Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece. Naturally, the common people don’t want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.” “There is one difference,” I pointed out. “In a democracy the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.” “Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.

940,9007,Researchers use smart phone to make a faster infection detector,"April 26, 2018","This news release about a smartphone-based infectious disease testing device confuses speed and device cost with benefits to patients and public health. It oversimplifies infectious disease detection and response. In their published study, the researchers reported an important achievement: comparable accuracy (under ideal conditions) with existing lab devices. However, the release doesn’t point out vital distinctions between performance in the lab and in real-world field use, or between the cost of a device and the total cost of a public health program that uses such a device. The release does not put the status of this device into context with other similar devices being developed by universities and companies around the world. We note that the release does report the funding source and the commercial intentions of the researchers. News releases should include essential context, not just certain facts that put researchers’ work in the most positive light. This release focuses narrowly on accuracy comparisons between an experimental device and existing lab equipment. It leaves reporters and other readers to discover on their own how this device compares to similar experimental products. The release highlights potential real-world health benefits without acknowledging the complex questions that need to be asked before anyone can know whether this device can deliver on the promises. Infectious diseases are still a significant source of mortality and morbidity especially in low and middle income countries. A device that could improve the diagnosis of these diseases would be useful in these settings.","Andrew Holtz, MPH,Dan Mayer, MD,Kathlyn Stone","The news release reports that the device would probably cost less than $50 to manufacture. However, the cost of a lab device is only part of the cost of infectious disease testing. What sort of training is needed to accurately interpret results? Would the device be able to replace conventional lab tests or would it be used as a preliminary test, that would then be checked by conventional tests? It is possible that in real world circumstances, the device could lead many more people into testing, potentially increasing the total cost of testing programs. The health benefit could be worthwhile, but the news release should not claim that a device would reduce costs without evidence of total costs in real world use. The release reports details of a direct comparison between test results produced by this device and standard lab equipment. However, relative accuracy of lab tests is not, by itself, a health benefit. The release says that using conventional lab testing services takes too long “by which time the infection may have become widespread.” The obvious implication is that this hand-held device would lead to more rapid and more effective outbreak detection in the field. Perhaps…but that’s not what was tested. The release should have been clearer that actual human health benefits won’t be known until after testing in the field. Tests, even accurate ones, have downsides which were not mentioned in this release. The release stated that the device “provided false positives only about one percent of the time.” If field workers fanned out across a city and tested 100,000 people, that 1% false positive rate would mean that about a thousand people would be told they were infected when they actually were not. The release did not mention false negatives (telling an infected person that he or she is not infected). The lead sentence of the release claims that this device “works nearly as well as clinical laboratories.” But what was actually reported was just a comparison of this device to standard lab equipment in an ideal laboratory setting as performed by the device’s developers. The release should have made clear that the device was not tested in the field or using people who had only the amount of training that would be available under actual use conditions. The release should have noted the limitations of the study. It would have been more appropriate for the release to state that the researchers made progress demonstrating the potential for their device but that the actual public health benefits won’t be known until after field testing. We will give the release a satisfactory rating on this criterion. However, other than measles, it is not clear that other types of infections used in this study (including mumps, herpes and Lyme disease) are responsible for the type of fast-moving outbreaks that the release says this device could help identify more rapidly. The release reports that the researchers have filed a patent and hope to commercialize their product. It also states that the work was supported by a Washington State University fund to support entrepreneurial endeavors. As noted above, this test was done by the device’s developers under ideal lab conditions. The comparisons to existing devices and speculation about relative effectiveness should wait until field tests are done. The release states that the researchers “hope to move forward with clinical trials that could lead to commercialization.” Although the release does not claim this device is the first or most advanced of its kind, it conspicuously avoids mentioning similar devices. A quick search of PubMed.gov and other online sources reveals a number of reports on similar products being tested at competing institutions including UCLA and Macquarie University in Australia. The release does not explain how this device compares to others. The release includes several speculative claims that this device could perform better than existing devices in reducing public health program costs, health care access and delivery, infectious disease control and more. None of these important goals has been tested.",false,"infectious disease,smartphone apps,Washington State University"
941,11506,"Lipogen Targets PMS/PMDD Relief, Naturally","March 2, 2016","This news release announces an Israel-based company’s success in obtaining a U.S. patent for a proprietary “phospholipid formulation” called PS Plus, which is purported to treat physical and “emotional” symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Somewhat misleadingly, the release suggests the formulation was “designed” to address PMS and PMDD, when in fact it appears to be the same single-ingredient supplement already sold to provide “brain support,” “sharpen memory” and ameliorate “stress.” Prevalence statistics presented in the release are contradictory and qualitatively lightweight. There is evidence in the literature of some clinical testing of phosphatidic acid, a natural phospholipid, or fatty acid derivative of soy lecithin, used as a carrier for some experimental drugs, but it is the only active ingredient mentioned on the product website – and not at all in the release — and there is precious little information about other ingredients or costs anywhere. PMS is a very common health condition in women of reproductive age. As such, women in this age group and in many countries may be interested in “natural” remedies to alleviate some of the symptoms. Additionally, Americans are high users of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions. Recent studies have noted that in the United States, “approximately 38 percent of adults (about 4 in 10) and approximately 12 percent of children (about 1 in 9) are using some form of CAM.” Moreover, CAM use among adults is greater among women and those with higher levels of education and higher incomes – exactly the population this news release is trying to reach. The supplement industry’s so-called “orthomolecular” therapies, which claim to maintain health with the use of natural compounds, have long been the subject of public health and scientific controversy, and come-and-go fads among consumers who spends millions on supplements for which rigorous evidence of clinical value is at best scant. For an aging population of boomers, in particular, the promise of protecting and boosting brain health (and by inference reducing the risk of age-related dementia), has been especially appealing, particularly if the products claim to be “natural” and with no ill effects. Similarly, for younger women, claims of safe, natural relief for  PMS and related syndromes are appealing, given that the conditions have long been “medicalized,” and such treatments as hormone replacement therapy and anti-depressants — all carrying risks and adverse effects —  have been over-prescribed and costly. Consequently, there is likely to be substantial interest in a product that promises to relieve what the release says are “more than 200 different symptoms” of PMS, and protect and enhance brain function.","Joann Rodgers, MS,Ranit Mishori, MD, MHS, FAAFP,Kathlyn Stone","Although the release points out the high costs of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other drug treatments for PMS cost $60 to $535 per month, it fails to mention that a 30-day supply of its product costs $54.95. According to a website showing the product patent application,  it appears to be a combination of phosphatidylserine (PS) as the active ingredient along with phosphatidic acid (PA) and magnesium. These products are available from other manufacturers for purchase on the internet for varying costs. Of interest, the patent application (but not the news release) states that various formulations were given “four times a day”…”from three weeks before the expected monthly menstruation until the commencement of menstruation.”  That would amount to more than 80 pills or tablets per cycle, which would be quite expensive compared to daily dosing of other medications. The description of the benefits is very poor, vague and unscientific. No information is given on study participants such as ages, inclusion criteria, type of symptoms, duration, and severity of symptoms at baseline and post-intervention. The release does report that 23 out of a subset of 220 women among 2,000 volunteers who took PS Plus for brain health and stress management over a two-month period, “noticed relief of premenstrual syndromes.” The company claims these are “strong” results. There is no description of potential harms. The company CEO is quoted saying there are “no reported side-effects.” However, a look at a commonly used scientific database for CAM product ingredients reveals there are side effects associated with phosphatidilserine, the active ingredient found in the product. Those include nausea, gastric distress and insomnia. There also may be an increased risk for acquiring infectious diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) if the phosphatidilserine is derived from bovine cortex, according to the database site. As noted above, there is precious little information about the volunteer subjects except that they are women, and under age 40. At one point, the release states that premenstrual syndromes occur in 15 percent of pre-menopausal women ages 25-44, and later that  symptoms “qualify” as PMS in 20 to 30 percent of such women. But there is no citation for these numbers, nor is it clear that they are meant to reflect the experience in the United States or elsewhere. The essential concern here is that there are no published data, based on standard clinical trial protocols, to provide credible evidence of benefits that are consistent and predictable. That has been an issue and challenge for the supplement industry, regulators, and consumers, and one not likely to end anytime soon. The release and the study upon which the evidence is based lumps together two conditions —  PMS and PMDD — which have different diagnostic criteria and severity. Their citations are inaccurate (PMS occurs in women outside of the age range 25-44, for example) and confusing. It is true that PMS can be annoying and disruptive, but many women’s symptoms are not disruptive enough to require any medication interventions. Additionally, lumping PMS it together with PMDD (which is much more severe and intense) is uncalled for and bordering on disease mongering. In addition, the release offered no explanation for how it came up with the claim that “More than 200 different symptoms have been associated with PMS.” It’s clear from the release that Lipogen, the company that issued the release, also funded the study. According to the release: “When the benefits of phospholipids on PMS and PMDD came to light through Lipogen’s research, we immediately explored its potential,” says David Rutenberg, CEO for Lipogen. Other than mentioning anti-depressants, which are not routinely prescribed for PMS, the release does not discuss any of the many other alternatives to managing PMS/PMDD symptom relief. Many interventions have been studied, from exercising (from which there is insufficient evidence) to other CAM therapies. According to a review published in American Family Physician journal, “A 2009 systematic review found 62 studies of herbal supplements, vitamins, and minerals with published claims for PMS symptom relief, only 10 of which were [randomized controlled trials] RCTs.” The review found that data are insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of ginkgo, saffron, St. John’s wort, soy, or vitamin E, because only one study existed for each. However, results suggested that chasteberry and vitamin B6 may reduce PMS symptoms.”  Other pharmacologic interventions include: SSRIs, oral-contraceptives, GnRH agonists, and anxyolitics. The release might have been strengthened somewhat if there had been some acknowledgement of some other non-pharmalogical interventions. The release doesn’t mention when or in which formulation the supplement might be available in the U.S. market, even though the release is introducing the supplement to a U.S. audience. The release does, albeit somewhat confusingly, make the point that the observation about its purported benefits in PMS were made, apparently serendipitously, during a study of its effects on brain health and stress. That’s newsworthy, but could have benefited from more detail. The claims made were not supported by the evidence provided. Some of the unsupported or misleading claims: “Realizing the significance of this discovery” “Strong results” “Can save significant health costs over medication alternatives” “No reported side-effects” “Lipogen guarantees its customers ingredient systems that are supported by the highest level of scientific data.” What are these “ingredient systems” and why didn’t they include the “highest level of scientific data?”",false,"industry/commercial news releases,Women's health"

At its lowest, in March 2011, his favorability among the Ohioans who had just elected him was an abysmal 30 percent. That was bad enough to crown Kasich as the least-popular governor in America for a brief period.",Nadia Pflaum,"Gov. John Kasich has been repeating an odd talking point lately: He keeps saying how unpopular he was as governor. The Ohio leader and presidential candidate said it in a Republican debate on March 30. On April 24, he repeated it on CBS Face the Nation when host John Dickerson asked if he thought it was possible for a candidate to change negative perceptions about him. ""After my first year as governor, I was one of the most unpopular governors, maybe the most unpopular governor in the country,"" Kasich said. ""It takes a long time to change negatives. People have to see that you're actually being fruitful in your work. What happened with me is when people started getting work, and we started balancing budgets and reaching out to people, it changed."" Is he right about being the least beloved state leader across the land after his first year in office? An August 2011 poll by Public Policy Polling said that with a 36 percent approval rating, he was the second or third least popular governor in the country. That was at least a few points better than in March 2011, when the same pollsters found Kasich’s approval ratings in the basement at 30 percent, and in May 2011 at 33 percent. Where was the love? In April 2011, his third month in office, Kasich made boatloads of enemies with a stroke of his pen. Kasich signed a massive union reform bill that prohibited forced union membership for state employees, mandated merit pay, outlawed strikes and limited collective bargaining rights for public employees. Unlike a similar reform bill in Wisconsin, Ohio’s SB 5 included police and firefighters. The political backlash was immediate, and a repeal effort quickly coalesced and reversed Kasich’s attempt at reform. Vying for the title of most unpopular governor in 2011 was Florida’s Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Public Policy Polling found that Kasich edged out Scott for most unfavorable governor in September 2011 with a 53 percent disapproval rating, compared to Scott’s 52 percent. But Kasich said he was (maybe) the country’s most unpopular governor after his first year. If he took office in January 2011, then we’d need to know his approval rating for the first few months of 2012. PolitiFact’s Louis Jacobson looked at the cast of rookie governors in February 2012, one year into their terms, for Governing magazine. Kasich made Jacobson’s list of the seven rookie governors who were struggling the most. Here they are, by approval rating: Jerry Brown (D-CA): 47 percent Rick Scott (R-FL): 43 percent Neil Abercrombie (D-HI): 39 percent Scott Walker (R-WI): 38 percent Nikki Haley (R-SC): 35 percent John Kasich (R-OH): 33 percent Lincoln Chafee (I -RI): 22 percent Based on these numbers, Kasich is the second-most unpopular governor after his first year. But Jacobson’s analysis only counted the 26 governors who took office at the start of 2011. Jacobson notes that approval ratings for governors aren’t exactly the holy grail of polling. He had to consult a handful of different polling groups for his comparison. Peter A. Brown, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, concurred. ""Nobody’s done every governor in the country,"" he said. ""There’s no reason to."" He said Quinnipiac only polls from nine states. ""What you can say is that it’s not possible to determine (whether Kasich was the least popular governor in the country),"" Brown said. ""But in a general sense, he’s probably right. He was certainly close to the bottom."" Rob Nichols, Kasich’s presidential campaign spokesman who was also the spokesman for the governor’s office in 2011, told us, ""Well yeah, we had just come from the election with $10 million in negative attack ads against us. So the last thing you saw was all this TV, trashing him."" Nichols also gave us this anecdote: In August 2011, his official email inbox was bombarded with form letters that started out, ""Dear Gov. Kasich staff member, I wanted Gov. Kasich to know that I voted for him in the Worst Governor Ever contest at www.worstgovernorever.com...."" ""I got so many that I had to get our IT people to route them to a special mailbox so they wouldn’t destroy my inbox,"" Nichols said. Ohioans started to warm to Kasich after the turbulent first year. Later in 2012, his rating bumped up to the 40s, and was up to 53 percent approval in 2013. Quinnipiac University had Kasich polling at 62 percent favorability in October 2015. Our ruling Kasich said, ""After my first year as governor, I was one of the most unpopular governors, maybe the most unpopular governor in the country.""

They alleged DePuy engaged in unfair and deceptive practices in the promotion of its ASR XL and Pinnacle Ultamet hip implant devices. DePuy in a statement said the settlement involves no admission of liability or misconduct on the part of the companies. “DePuy Synthes remains committed to meeting the current and future needs of orthopedic surgeons and patients,” the company said. The states claimed J&J made misleading claims about the longevity of its metal-on-metal hip implants, with patients frequently having to undergo a revision surgery before the company’s advertised timeframe of five years. Under Tuesday’s settlement agreement, DePuy is required to maintain a post-market surveillance program and update procedures to track complaints over the hip implants, according to a statement by New York Attorney General Letitia James. DePuy in 2010 announced a worldwide voluntary recall of 93,000 of its ASR hip implant systems, saying that 12 percent of them failed within five years. Saying it would pay at least $2.47 billion, the company has since settled thousands of lawsuits by patients who had to have the ASR implant removed. In 2013, DePuy ceased selling the Pinnacle devices after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. Metal-on-metal hip implants have also come under scrutiny over allegations that the products cause a build-up of metal ions in the blood, causing groin pain, allergic reactions, bone erosion and tissue death. The company faces some 10,400 lawsuits in the United States over its Pinnacle device in connection with those claims.

946,12405,Americans are 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries.,"June 14, 2017","Candidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently said ""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot and killed than others in developed countries."" Newsom’s spokesman pointed to a study in the American Journal of Medicine that backs up this very sad statistic. It found the gun homicide rate in the United States is about 25 times greater than in other high-income, industrialized countries such as Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. A similar study by the United Nations found America had a slightly lower gun homicide rate but included countries such as Turkey and Chile with relatively high gun homicide rates not included in the American Journal of Medicine report. Their inclusion explains the slightly lower rate. Newsom’s claim is backed by what appears to be a valid study. But another report with credible findings shows the gun homicide rate is not quite as high compared to other nations as Newsom asserts. His statement could have used this additional information. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. ",Chris Nichols,"Gun control is a top priority for California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. So, it’s no surprise Newsom, a Democrat and 2018 candidate for governor, promoted the cause on National Gun Violence Awareness Day. He claimed in a statement on Twitter on June 2, 2017: ""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries. We've had enough. #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay."" This is not the first time we’ve fact-checked a gun claim by Newsom. In November 2016, we rated his assertion that California has seen a ""56 percent decline in the gun murder rate"" since the 1990s. Earlier that year, his statement that ""So far in 2015, there have been more mass shootings than days."" In this case, we wondered whether the facts support his claim about the seemingly huge disparity in gun homicide rates between the United States and other developed countries. We’ll fact-check this claim below. First, here’s some background on Newsom and the 2018 California governor’s race. Governor’s race Newsom is among several prominent Democrats as of now competing in 2018 to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others include former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; California Treasurer John Chiang and Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction. Announced Republican candidates include John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a Hall of Fame professional football player.

Email us at [email protected], tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook. Newsom has supported California’s stringent gun and ammunition laws. In 2016, he proposed and helped pass Proposition 63, a voter initiative that requires instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Our research We interpreted Newsom’s claim of ""shot and killed"" to mean gun homicides. These are intentional killings using a firearm, not including suicides. To back up the statement, Newsom’s campaign spokesman pointed to a study published in the American Journal of Medicine in March 2016 called ""Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010."" The study relied on mortality data from 2010 collected by the World Health Organization. It found the rate of gun homicides was 25.2 times higher in the United States than in 22 other populous and high-income countries for which data was also gathered. A sample of those included South Korea, Australia, Canada, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy. When considering all types of gun deaths, such as homicides, accidental shootings and suicides, people in the United States were 10 times more likely to die from a gun-related death than those in the other countries, the report said. Authors of study weigh in We contacted the co-authors of this study. Both described Newsom’s claim as ""accurate."" ""Yes, what he said seems accurate,"" David Hemenway, professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-author, said by email. ""I think anyone who looks at the data would agree."" Erin Grinshteyn, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of San Francisco and the other co-author, also said the claim was correct. Grinshteyn described the report as ""purely an academic study."" She said her portion of the work was not funded while Hemenway’s participation was funded, in part, by the Joyce Foundation. On its website, the foundation says it supports ""research-based strategies that can prevent gun violence by reducing the easy accessibility of firearms."" Related study In 2014, PolitiFact examined a related claim by lawyer and author Lisa Bloom that said ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries."" PolitiFact took this to mean gun homicides. It rated her claim , citing figures collected by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. That data showed the United States had a slightly lower gun homicide rate in 2010 than reported in the American Journal of Medicine Study. That, in turn, meant Americans would be closer to 20 times as likely to die in gun homicides compared with several other ""civilized countries."" But as PolitiFact noted, much depends on which countries are included in this comparison and the years for which that data was available. Chile and Turkey, both with relatively high gun homicide rates, were included in the United Nations study but not in the report in the American Journal of Medicine. Grinshteyn told us her study only included high-income, populous countries  as defined by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development. ""If they included Chile and Turkey, which were not included in our comparison group, those will cause the comparison to be skewed,"" she added. We reached out to the Sacramento-based Firearms Policy Coalition, a gun rights advocacy group, to ask whether its members knew of any additional and independent reports on this topic. We did not immediately hear back. Our rating Candidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently said ""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot and killed than others in developed countries."" Newsom’s spokesman pointed to a study in the American Journal of Medicine that backs up this very sad statistic. It found the gun homicide rate in the United States is about 25 times greater than in other high-income, industrialized countries such as Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. A similar study by the United Nations found America had a slightly lower gun homicide rate but included countries such as Turkey and Chile with relatively high gun homicide rates not included in the American Journal of Medicine report. Their inclusion explains the slightly lower rate. Newsom’s claim is backed by what appears to be a valid study. But another report with credible findings shows the gun homicide rate is not quite as high compared to other nations as Newsom asserts. His statement could have used this additional information. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",true,"Crime, The 2018 California Governor's Race, California, Guns, Gavin Newsom, "
947,17766,"In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths.","October 29, 2013","Sachs’ statistic -- that starting in 2011,  texting began surpassing alcohol as the leading contributing factor to teen driving deaths -- was based on a misinterpretation of a scientific study and information from NHTSA that could not be confirmed. In reality, NHTSA’s analysis of their data found that alcohol was involved in more lethal crashes than distracted driving in 2011. While there’s no question that texting while driving is a danger, it hasn’t supplanted alcohol as ""the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths."" However, the figures are imperfect enough that we can't rule out an undercount in deaths associated with texting while driving.",Rochelle Koff,"On the first day of Florida’s new texting-while-driving ban, state Sen. Maria Sachs, the Senate Democratic leader pro-tem, was already announcing a proposal to make the law tougher. The new law makes texting while driving a secondary offense, which means an officer can’t ticket a motorist only for typing or reading messages while behind the wheel. Rather, the driver has to first commit another violation, like swerving or running a red light. Sachs, of Delray Beach, has filed a bill to make texting while driving a primary offense, which she argues will make it easier to enforce. The penalties -- $30 for a first violation -- will remain. At a press conference with AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson to announce her proposed changes, Sachs recited several somber statistics. We decided to fact-check this claim: ""In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths."" There’s little doubt that texting is a danger in automobile safety. A 2006 study by David Strayer and Frank Drews at the University of Utah found that people are just as impaired when they drive and talk on a cell phone as they are when they drive intoxicated at the legal blood-alcohol limit of 0.08 percent. The report, which looked at talking on handheld or hands-free cell phones and not texting, concluded that using a cell phone while driving ""can be as profound as those associated with driving while drunk."" But is it true that in 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths? When we contacted Sachs’ office, her legislative chief of staff said the information came from an op-ed piece AutoNation’s Mike Jackson wrote for the Tampa Bay Times and from news articles about a study done by the Cohen Children’s Medical Center in Long Island, N.Y. The statistic quoted by Sachs has appeared in various media outlets, including CBS and Newsday, but the study’s chief researcher, Dr. Andrew Adesman, said the media ""wrongly attributed"" the drinking-texting conclusions to his team’s studies, a bit of misinformation that has continued to spread. Adesman said his research team analyzed CDC data -- the 2011 ""Youth Risk Behavior Survey"" The study found that 45 percent of U.S. high school students 16 and up (46 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls) reported texting while driving during the previous 30 days. The study suggested that the number could actually be a lot higher, given that 75 percent of teens now have cell phones. The study, however, didn’t directly compare texting and drinking while driving, which makes Sachs’ conclusion questionable. The study found a ""subgroup"" of the students who admit to texting while driving also tended to be involved in other risky behaviors on the road, including not wearing a seatbelt, riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol and drinking and driving. These risk takers were also more likely to smoke marijuana, have unsafe sex and ""use indoor tanning devices."" The correlation of all these factors makes it difficult to determine what is the ""leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths."" Indeed, certain aspects of the study didn’t provide much support for proponents of texting laws. Researchers found that while texting while driving was slightly less common in states that prohibit it, ""the reality is that millions of teens text while driving,"" Adesman said. The study didn’t consider the strength of the laws or penalties. Adesman did say there’s reason to be alarmed about the number of teens texting. ""Kids aren’t drinking on a regular basis on school days, but they are texting daily."" (The CDC reports that high school teens drive after drinking 2.4 times a month.) Sachs said she wants to ""change the culture"" of texting while driving. ""I think our culture has turned against alcohol and driving, so we want to say to kids, ‘you know it’s wrong to drink and drive’ and the same thing has to be said about texting."" Another problem for Sachs’ claim: The data isn’t perfect. The involvement of cell phones is still underreported in accidents, said Deb Trombley, senior program manager for transportation initiatives for the National Safety Council. ""One challenge is that there isn’t good data. Cell phone use isn’t being recorded on crash reports… It goes down as distracted driving."" Jackson’s office said that he discovered the information about texting surpassing drunk driving as a cause of teen driving deaths from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, but staff didn’t have any further details. NHTSA officials said the data they collect suggested the opposite of what Jackson and Sachs claimed. According to the agency, 12 percent of 2,105 teen-aged drivers ages 14 to 18 involved in fatal crashes in 2011 were distracted in some way; 24 percent of those distracted drivers were using a cell phone. By comparison, 20 percent (428) of 14 to 18-year-old drivers involved in a fatal crash in 2011 had some level of alcohol in their system, according to NHTSA. A driving distraction can be anything from adjusting the radio or putting on makeup to eating a burger behind the wheel. With teens, there are often a bunch of noisy friends in the car. Our ruling Sachs’ statistic -- that starting in 2011,  texting began surpassing alcohol as the leading contributing factor to teen driving deaths -- was based on a misinterpretation of a scientific study and information from NHTSA that could not be confirmed. In reality, NHTSA’s analysis of their data found that alcohol was involved in more lethal crashes than distracted driving in 2011.

948,39839, This is a forwarded self   defense tip that says if you do not have pepper spray to use a can of   wasp spray to stop an assailant. Wasp spray shoots a stream up to twenty   feet and can temporality blind an attacker.     ,"March 17, 2015",Use Wasp Spray to Stop an Assailant as a Criminal Deterrent ,  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"The source quoted in the   eRumor for this suggestion of the use of wasp spray for defense is a man   named Val Glinka. He is real and is a self defense instructor at   Sylvania Southview High School near Toledo Ohio. He told an  ABC affiliate that he considers wasp   spray “inexpensive, easy to find, and more effective than mace or pepper   spray.”  Glinka said, “This is better than anything I can teach   them.”  Pepper spray is a personal defense weapon that is legal in all 50   states. Each state has various restrictions as to how it is sold and   when it was originally introduced users in some states had to take a   self defense class to be certified for proper use. We have not found any other credible source that recommends using wasp   spray instead of pepper spray. We have not found any studies that   suggest that wasp spray would be effective as a deterrent. There is also a   liability issue to consider. There is the question of whether using   insecticides in such a manner could bring liability issues for the user. Insecticides are controlled by the  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA), which prohibits   the use of such products other than the originally intended purpose. The EPA web site has information posted that says insecticides must be   properly labeled to inform users on proper use before they can be sold. The EPA site also says, “The overall intent of the label is to provide   directions for product use while managing risks to human health and the   environment. It is a violation of federal law to use a pesticide in a   manner inconsistent with its labeling.” Police officer   J.D. Dhein hosts an internet radio feature called “Police   On The Scene” and this eRumor was read   to him on his program by his producer. Dhein was taken by surprise by   the advice offered and voiced his concerns about liability issues of   using wasp spray against an assailant. He said that he did   not believe that any police department would suggest the use of wasp   spray as a criminal deterrent. He did offer the church a valuable   tip when counting the offering and that was to lock the door. Updated 06/04/10    Comments",false,"Crime / Police, Miscellaneous, Warnings"
950,1051,"U.S. states, cities sue to block Trump 'conscience' rule for healthcare workers.","May 21, 2019",Two dozen U.S. states and municipalities sued the Trump administration on Tuesday to stop it from enforcing a rule that would make it easier for doctors and nurses to avoid performing abortions on religious or moral grounds.,Jonathan Stempel,"A lawsuit led by New York Attorney General Letitia James said the expanded “conscience” protections could undermine the ability of states and cities to provide effective healthcare without jeopardizing billions of dollars a year in federal aid. It also said the rule would upset legislative efforts to accommodate workers’ beliefs while ensuring that hospitals, other businesses and staff treat patients effectively. Sterilizations and assisted suicide are other procedures that might be impeded, according to a complaint filed by New York and 22 other states and municipalities in federal court in Manhattan. California filed a similar lawsuit in San Francisco. “The federal government is giving health care providers free license to openly discriminate and refuse care to patients,” James said in a statement. The rule is scheduled to take effect on July 22. It will be enforced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Roger Severino, director of HHS’ Office for Civil Rights, said in a statement: “The rule gives life and enforcement tools to conscience protection laws that have been on the books for decades. HHS finalized the conscience rule after more than a year of careful consideration and after analyzing over 242,000 public comments. We will defend the rule vigorously.”  President Donald Trump, a Republican, has made expanding religious liberty a priority, and the proposed rule drew  support from anti-abortion activists. Critics, including some civil rights medical groups, have said the rule could deprive some patients, including gay and transgender people, of needed healthcare because they might be deemed less worthy of treatment. The Manhattan lawsuit said the rule could even prevent hospitals from asking applicants for nursing jobs whether they opposed giving measles vaccinations, even during an outbreak. So far in 2019, the worst U.S. measles outbreak in a quarter century has sickened 880 people, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday.

951,33804,"In August 1997, the Baltimore Orioles deliberately created a lighting malfunction before a game to keep Cal Ripken's consecutive game streak intact.","June 27, 2001","Whatever Kevin Costner’s relationship with the Ripkens might have been, Cal and Kelly stayed together long afterwards (they were married for 28 years), and Costner didn’t make some Machiavellian maneuvering on the part of the Orioles necessary to keep Cal from missing a game.",David Mikkelson,"On 6 September 1995, Baltimore Orioles infielder Cal Ripken, Jr. broke a record long thought to be unassailable when he played in his 2,131st consecutive baseball game, surpassing the mark of 2,130 set by Lou Gehrig back in 1939. Ripken would go on to play in a total of 2,632 straight games before finally sitting one out on 20 September 1998. One of the most remarkable aspects of Ripken’s most remarkable of streaks was that he started every game (i.e., his streak included no pinch-hitting, pinch-running, or late-inning defensive appearances), he voluntarily left a game before the seventh inning only four times (in addition to twice being ejected by umpires), and at one point he played every single inning of every single game for a span over five years. In other words, Ripken didn’t even come close to missing a game during his streak — except, as rumor claims, for one evening in August 1997, when Ripken was unable to make it to the park for that day’s game due to the fallout of having caught his wife in bed with another man, and a mysterious malfunction in his home ballpark’s lighting system (allegedly one deliberately created by an Orioles employee) forced the cancellation of the game and thereby preserved Ripken’s streak:  Cal Ripken, Jr. was allowing Kevin Costner, the actor, to stay at his house, following the wrap of “The Postman”. One day, Ripken left for Camden Yards to play in a game. Somewhere between his home and the stadium, Cal realized that he had left something back at his house, and turned back to retrieve it. Upon arriving at his home, he found Kevin Costner in bed with his wife, Kelly. Cal then proceeded to beat the crap out of Costner, to the point that Costner was unable to make any publicity opportunities for a time. Cal then called the Orioles, and told them he wouldn’t be coming in to play that day. Upon hearing this, the owner reminded Cal about his streak, telling him The Streak would end if he didn’t play that day. Cal told him it was impossible for him to come in, so there went the streak. Reportedly, the owner told him not to worry, because he would take care of it. That night, the game was cancelled due to “electrical failure” with some lights on the field. The caller [I heard this rumor from] said that there was no problem with the lights, that everything else, including the hotels and restaurants that are part of Camden Yards, worked perfectly. The next day, the lights were fixed, Cal was able to play, and the streak stayed intact. A game between the Orioles and the Seattle Mariners scheduled for Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore on 14 August 1997 was cancelled due to lighting problems, but there was nothing “mysterious” about the incident. A ground fault interrupt kept tripping the circuit breaker each time the lights in one of Oriole Park’s lighting banks were turned on, and the game’s 7:35 P.M. starting time was pushed back as a crew worked on the problem. (That the businesses surrounding Oriole Park did not experience similar problems is not strange, as the ballpark is on a separate portion of the city’s power grid.) The crew finally got the bank of lights working by 8:45 P.M., but about 20 bulbs in the bank failed to illuminate, and the umpiring crew had to make the decision whether to allow the game to begin. Umpire crew chief Al Clark officially postponed the game at 10 P.M. after determining that shadows at home plate created unsafe playing conditions, a decision influenced by the fact that fireballing pitcher Randy Johnson was scheduled to start for the Mariners. Given that Johnson was a left-hander who threw extremely hard, and the lighting outage occurred on the first-base side of the field (i.e., the side on which batters would be visually picking up the ball from Johnson’s hand as the southpaw threw towards home plate), the risk of serious injury to a batter was deemed too great to allow the game to proceed. The contest was cancelled and made up as part of a double-header the following day. Shortly afterwards, a conspiracy rumor was concocted from this scenario which involved actor Kevin Costner, who had a long-standing friendship with Cal Ripken, and rumors of marital difficulties between Ripken and his wife Kelly. According to that rumor, Ripken caught Costner in bed with his wife on the morning of 14 August 1997, and the shock of that betrayal left Ripken too emotionally distraught and/or too sore and bruised from brawling with Costner to show up at Camden Yards for the Orioles’ game with the Seattle Mariners that evening. (Some versions of the rumor even maintained that Ripken couldn’t make it to the ballpark because he had been hauled off to jail for assault.) In order to preserve the tremendous publicity value of Ripken’s consecutive game steak, Orioles management quickly arranged for someone in the Camden Yards facilities crew to create a ‘malfunction’ that would prevent the day’s game from coming off as scheduled and provide Ripken with a much-needed day off to recover from his ordeal. Kevin Costner and Cal Ripken, Jr. met in 1990 at a premiere of Costner’s film Dances with Wolves and began what Costner described as a “burgeoning friendship.”  Before a game during the 1991 season, Costner took batting and fielding practice with the Orioles, played catch on the sidelines, went through stretching exercises in the outfield, and batted and took grounders with Ripken. Costner was often seen taking in Orioles games from the stands at Baltimore’s Camden Yards, sometimes sitting with Ripken’s wife, Kelly. In late 1997, gossip began circulating to the effect that the Ripkens had separated, Cal was staying with a teammate, and a divorce was imminent. The rumors included claims of infidelities on both sides, with the male interloper named as anyone from “an Orioles trainer” to Costner (who at the time lived about an hour from the Ripkens’ ranch). From such rumors was the “mysterious game cancellation” legend concocted back in 1998. Whether the electrical outage was “mysterious” or not, it wasn’t devised to keep Ripken’s streak alive by forcing the cancellation of a game he would otherwise have missed. News reports of the day’s events prove Ripken was present at the ballpark, suited up and ready to play, and both fans and reporters noted him sitting in the dugout and playing catch along the sidelines that evening. Ripken himself addressed the rumor in a 2008 interview on NPR:  It’s easy to check the facts of that one. I remember it very well. The bank of lights went off and Randy Johnson was pitching for the Seattle Mariners. And we were deciding what to do about that. Was there enough visible light out there to actually see a guy throwing over 100 miles per hour? The bank was just over our dugout. And I physically went out and tested it for the umpire. I was in discussion with the umpires. I was definitely there, I was ready to play. And the funny part about it was we all decided it was better that we play that night, because the next day would have been a Sunday day game, and Randy Johnson would have been throwing out of the stands, and in day games he’s much harder to see. So we all decided that we were going to go. Evidently [Mariners manager] Lou Piniella told Seattle a little different story that the game wasn’t going to go, and they started leaving the ballpark, so we didn’t have that option after all. We scheduled it for the next day, and we played. But I definitely was there. And I’m sure I was on camera a number of times being out on the field. When this legend was repeated by a couple of hosts on Fox Sports Radio in June 2001, an angry Costner called the show the next day to deny it and tell the hosts that if they had claimed the story was true, “I was going to take your heads off.”  Costner maintained at the time that he had met Ripken’s wife only twice in his life, that he had probably spent no more than 10 minutes with her altogether, and that he had never been to the Ripkens’ home. (Since Costner had been noted sitting in the stands for whole games with Kelly Ripken, his “10 minutes” and “twice in his life” claims were probably underestimates).",false,"Entertainment, baseball"
953,22336,David Prosser Says Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg’s record as a state Justice Department lawyer consists only of the prosecution of cases regarding regulation of docks.,"April 1, 2011",Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice David Prosser says challenger JoAnne Kloppenburg’s record consists only of prosecuting cases regarding regulation of docks,James B. Nelson,"The candidates in the acrimonious race for Wisconsin Supreme Court have spent a considerable amount of time focusing on their experience and qualifications for the job. Justice David Prosser’s experience is pretty simple to understand. He has served a dozen years on the court and was Outagamie County district attorney for a couple of years. A Republican, Prosser also served 16 years in the state Assembly, and was speaker. The JoAnne Kloppenburg file is more difficult to evaluate: 21 years as an attorney in the state Department of Justice. That leaves plenty of room for interpretation -- by the candidate and her opponent. That’s what happened in a March 21, 2011, debate at the Marquette University Law School. Prosser told the audience that Kloppenburg ""is incredibly envious"" of his record as a district attorney, and his time as a lawmaker and justice. He said he had prosecuted cases that involved violent crime. ""I’ve had victims of crime cry on my shoulder,"" Prosser said. He continued with this observation about Kloppenburg’s experience: ""She has a very different record as a prosecutor. It’s all the prosecution of DNR regulations of docks … the length of docks. The width of docks. Whether people can have docks. That’s a complete different kind of prosecution that I am familiar with or have been writing cases about as well for 12 and a half years."" That stopped us and undoubtedly many in the audience. More than two decades on cases hassling dock owners? Sounds like a lot of legal grunt work. It’s a claim that Prosser has made repeatedly on the campaign trail, and a theme that’s been picked up in ads from outside groups attacking Kloppenburg. We asked for backup. Prosser’s campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir said in an email that state court records and other research tools showed 46 cases that involved Kloppenburg, 76 percent of which ""were for the DNR."" ""Of the 46, five were directly identifiable with piers,"" he said. Fair enough. For a decade, Kloppenburg led the Department of Justice’s environmental litigation team. Docks would be in her wheelhouse. Kloppenburg opponents have seized on her record as a environmental lawyer, painting her as an extremist. On March 29, talk show host Charlie Sykes said: ""If you are an environmental zealot, I do understand that JoAnne Kloppenburg is probably your candidate."" Sykes added: ""If you have a pier that’s a few feet too close … JoAnne Kloppenburg is your worst enemy."" But let’s circle back to the support Prosser’s campaign provided. Of the 46 cases cited, only five dealt with docks. What about the rest? The Kloppenburg campaign gave us a list of 17 published decisions of cases that she argued before the state Appeals Court. The cases involved water and air pollution permits, a landfill dispute and the state’s authority over navigable waterways. Two involved the civil rights of state prison inmates, one involved the treatment of a prisoner. No dock cases were included. The campaign noted that over the years, Kloppenburg has argued hundreds of cases in circuit courts around the state, and numerous cases before the state Supreme Court -- including one in which a decision was handed down March 23,  two days after the debate at Marquette. In that case, Kloppenburg represented the state in a lawsuit involving a dispute over a hearing for a water discharge permit for a paper mill in Green Bay. Environmentalists wanted a public hearing about the permit; the DNR did not. Kloppenburg represented the DNR and won the case -- with Prosser voting with the majority. While environmentalists were unhappy with the decision, business groups -- some of which are paying for ads attacking Kloppenburg’s legal credentials -- were pleased. She said her campaign was able to identify citations of 206 court cases dating back to 1989, and said few, if any, involved docks or piers. Other cases she’s handled in her career included those involving complaints from prisoners, the state’s part of lawsuits against big tobacco companies, Indian treaty rights and gaming compacts, and medical malpractice caps. She has had numerous cases involving well-known state and local companies, including Patrick Cudahy, Enbridge, Georgia Pacific, and a sunken barge in the Menomonee River. Kloppenburg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board that her job was to enforce the state’s environmental laws. When we asked Prosser directly to explain his comment, he said he was well aware Kloppenburg handled a much broader variety of cases for the Justice Department than docks. Indeed, a number of them were argued before him on the Supreme Court. ""I’m certainly aware of the breadth of those cases,"" Prosser said, adding that his comments about docks were ""a little rhetorical flourish."" Prosser recalled a case about a July 2006 decision about a Green Lake subdivision that let homeowners have a fractional interest so they could have a boat slip on a nearby dock. The court ruled in favor of the DNR and forced the association to reduce the number of boat slips. Prosser also mentioned another case that was relayed to him in a private letter from a circuit court judge in northern Wisconsin. ""Those are the two I was most familiar with,"" Prosser said. He added this about his dock comment: ""I was really trying to inject a little bit of levity into this. I think the rhetorical flourish is easily justified in terms of these two cases."" But that flies in the face of the reality of the campaign. As we noted, the dock cases have emerged as a line of attack against Kloppenburg from several fronts. What’s more, those in the audience didn’t offer a lot of chuckles during that portion of the debate. Former Journal Sentinel reporter Alan Borsuk, who now works for the Marquette Law School, blogged this about the event: ""I’ve been at some testy and tense debates and joint appearances by candidates in various races, but this one was way up the list, if it wasn’t the champion on my personal list."" Borsuk noted the exchange about experience and said Prosser touted his record ""while slighting her record in environmental work with the attorney general’s office as involving ‘the length of (boat) docks.’""  Let’s bring this ship to shore. Justice Prosser told a debate audience that his opponent’s work as a prosecutor was very limited and said she only handled cases involving the size and length of docks. But the record shows a much broader range of cases handled by Kloppenburg in her time at the Department of Justice. Indeed, Prosser later said he was well aware of the ""breadth"" of those cases. What’s more, Prosser brushed the claim off as a ""rhetorical flourish"" and an attempt at ""levity."" That would be more believable if people treated it that way at the time and if it didn’t match up with one of the major lines of attack from Kloppenburg critics in the campaign. At PolitiFact, a statement is False if it is not accurate. It’s not accurate to say that Kloppenburg’s has only handled dock cases. That’s a ridiculous claim -- from a justice who has heard her argue a variety of cases before him on the state’s high court.

958,9212,New study finds EPA and DHA omega-3s lower risk of coronary heart disease,"January 6, 2017","This news release summarizes a recent paper published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings that evaluated the effect two types of omega-3 fatty acids — eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) — had on reducing risk of coronary heart disease. The report was a meta-analysis, meaning researchers evaluated the findings of multiple published studies. Specifically, the meta-analysis looked at 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 16 prospective cohort studies. RCTs are designed to measure the effect of a specific intervention under clearly-defined, experimental conditions. This means that researchers aim to determine, with some degree of certainty, whether a specific intervention is causing a specific outcome. Prospective cohort studies follow large groups of people over extended periods of time, allowing researchers to determine what characteristics or behaviors may be associated with specific outcomes. Because of the nature of these cohort studies, they can only tell researchers if a behavior or practice is correlated with an outcome — but not whether the behavior is causing the outcome. These sorts of meta-analyses can be extremely valuable tools for assessing a broad body of work on a given subject. However, this news release is problematic. It is written in a way that is confusing, if not misleading, and fails to make clear that the scientific-sounding organization that funded the study (and wrote the release) is an industry group that was created to promote the global use of omega-3 supplements or foods that are high in omega-3s. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, approximately 370,000 people die of coronary heart disease each year in the United States. Many adults make decisions about their diet, activities and lifestyle based on how those decisions may affect their heart health. Research on subjects such as how omega-3 fatty acids affect heart disease risk play an important role here. According to a 2015 Washington Post article, people in the U.S. spend $1.2 billion each year on fish oil supplements, largely because they contain omega-3s that consumers think will reduce their risk of heart disease. But increasingly consistent evidence shows that fish oil does not, in fact, protect against heart disease. If people are going to make informed decisions about their personal health — and how they spend their money — they need to have good information that they can actually understand. News releases like this one make it hard for most consumers to understand exactly what the research says.","Matt Shipman,Yoni Freedhoff, MD,Kathlyn Stone","Cost is only addressed in a quote from the executive director of an omega-3 industry organization, who refers to increasing one’s omega-3 intake as an “inexpensive” lifestyle change. What does “inexpensive” mean? What may be cheap for one consumer could be cost-prohibitive for another. What’s more, it’s difficult for any reader to work out what the cost may be, because the release doesn’t make it easy to determine how much of EPA or DHA one needs to take in order to see any potential benefit. It is only in the tenth paragraph, which quotes an editorial suggesting that taking “at least 1 gram of EPA+DHA per day…continues to be a reasonable strategy.” That’s still not necessarily clear for many consumers, since it’s not directly linked to the benefits discussed elsewhere in the release, but it’s the only reference to how much an individual might need to consume — and it’s buried near the bottom of the release. The release tells readers that, among the RCTs, “there was a statistically significant reduction in [coronary heart disease] risk in higher risk populations, including…16 percent in those with high triglycerides and 14 percent in those with high LDL [low-density lipoprotein] cholesterol.” So the release is claiming that seafood, supplements and pharmaceuticals offer a 16 percent reduction in risk of coronary heart disease for people with high triglycerides. That sounds good, right? But over what time span? A year? A lifetime? And how high does a person’s trigylceride count need to be in order for that person to have “high triglycerides?” The release doesn’t tell us. And then things get really confusing. Consider this statement: “A non-statistically significant 6 percent risk reduction among all populations in RCTs, a finding supported by a statistically significant 18 percent reduced risk of [coronary heart disease] among prospective cohort studies.” Does the statistically significant finding somehow make the non-statistically significant finding more, well, significant? No. Does bundling those two things together into one sentence muddy the waters for readers? You bet. Does the release still fail to explain the time-frame it is using when discussing risk reduction? Yes. Providing readers with figures describing the absolute risk reduction would have been very helpful here. The release does not mention any potential problems associated with omega-3s. And there are potential harms. For example, the University of Maryland Medical Center notes that patients should consult with their doctors about potential interactions with prescription drugs before taking omega-3 supplements, and adds that “High doses of omega-3 fatty acids may increase the risk of bleeding, even in people without a history of bleeding disorders, and even in those who are not taking other medications.” There are concerns about other potential harms as well, such as whether fish oil supplements may increase risk for prostate cancer. We don’t expect a news release to include an exhaustive summary of all the possible harms associated with a particular intervention. But we do expect a news release to at least acknowledge that the potential for harms exists, when appropriate. The release does tell readers the total number of RCTs and cohort studies that the meta-analysis looked at, as well as the overall number of study participants involved. That’s good. The release also articulates the difference between the two types of studies — which is also a good thing. However, things get dicey when the release starts discussing benefits. For example, the release tells readers that “The study reviewed 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 16 prospective cohort studies, with 93,000 and 732,000 subjects, respectively.” As noted above, the release also states that the study found a “16 percent [risk reduction] in those with high triglycerides and 14 percent in those with high LDL cholesterol.” It would be natural for readers to assume that those risk reduction numbers are based on the 18 RCT studies, which evaluated 93,000 study participants. But that would be wrong. According to the journal article, only six of the RCT studies looked at patients with “high triglycerides,” and only five of the RCT studies looked at patients with high LDL cholesterol. So, while the release is not technically incorrect, it’s misleading — and that’s not okay. No disease mongering here. But there’s also no context about the prevalence of coronary heart disease. This is a really close call. The story makes clear that the research was funded by the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s (GOED) — which also issued this news release, through AAAS’s EurekAlert! news service. The release also quotes two GOED employees, and clearly identifies them as such. However, the release doesn’t include any language explaining what GOED is, what it does, or who its members are. And that’s important, because GOED is not an independent research organization, it’s an industry group that exists to promote consumer use of products that contain omega-3 fatty acids. There are many actions that invididuals can take to reduce their risk of coronary heart disease, including losing weight, exercising regularly, and managing stress. The release doesn’t mention any of them. This is particularly problematic given that these are actions which are not mutually exclusive: one could lose weight, exercise regularly, manage stress and eat more fish (for example). The release refers to consuming EPA and DHA in the form of either seafood or supplements, so we’ll give this a pass. However, that single reference to sources of EPA and DHA is only found in a quote in the tenth paragraph. There are a ton (to use a technical term) of studies on omega-3 fatty acids and heart disease, including lots (and lots) of meta-analyses (like this one or this one, for example). What sets this meta-analysis apart? The release doesn’t tell us. As noted above under the Why This Matters section, there’s considerable evidence and recent consensus that fish oil doesn’t have much if any effect on cardiovascular disease. A few points here. First, the release states that increasing their consumption of omega-3s is a “change that most consumers need to make.” That’s over-reach, and that alone would give the release an unsatisfactory rating here. But there’s one other note that we’ll make here, since it doesn’t really fit anywhere else: at no point does the news release tell readers what EPA and DHA stand for. Nor does it explain what they are, or even what omega-3 fatty acids are, much less how they may be beneficial for heart health. If you’re going to use terms that are not common knowledge — such as “DHA omega-3s” — please give your readers some idea of what you’re talking about.",false,"coronary artery disease,Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s,GOED,omega-3s"
961,33563,"A hand-held police radar unit successfully tracked a military aircraft on maneuvers, nearly causing the aircraft to fire a missile in response.","May 23, 2000","A classic ""warning against technology"" tale.",Snopes Staff,"This report has been circulating around the internet for several years at least. Examples: A report has revealed that two traffic patrol officers from North Berwick were involved in an unusual incident whilst checking for speeding motorists on the A1 road between Oldhamstocks and   Grantshouse. Last May, they were using a hand-held radar device to trap unwary motorists on the Edinburgh to London trunk road. One of the unnamed officers used the device to check the speed of an approaching vehicle, and was surprised to find that his target had registered a speed in excess of 300 miles per hour. The £5000 machine then seized up and could not be reset by the bemused PC’s. The radar had in fact latched on to a NATO Tornado aircraft in the North Sea, which was taking part in a simulated low-flying exercise over the Borders and Southern Scotland. Following a complaint by Sir William Sutherland, Chief Constable of the Lothian & Borders Police force to the RAF liaison office, it was revealed that the officers had a lucky escape – the tactical computer on board the aircraft not only detected and jammed the “hostile” radar equipment, but had automatically armed a Sidewinder air-to-ground missile ready to neutralize the perceived threat. Luckily the Dutch pilot was alerted to the missile status and was able to override the automatic protection system before the missile launched. The Police have so far declined to comment, although it is understood that officers will be advised to point their radar guns inland in future. USMC speeding ticket Top this for a speeding ticket: Two California Highway Patrol Officers were conducting speeding enforcement on I-15, North of MCAS Miramar. One of the officers was using a hand held radar device to check speeding vehicles approaching near the crest of a hill. The officers were suddenly surprised when the radar gun began reading 300+ miles per hour. The officer attempted to reset the radar gun, but it would not reset and turned off. Just then a deafening roar over the treetops revealed that the radar had in fact locked onto a USMC F/A-18 Hornet which was engaged in a low flying exercise near the location. Back at the CHP Headquarters the Patrol Captain fired off a complaint to the USMC Base Commander. Back came a reply in true USMC style: Thank you for the message, which allows us to complete the file on this incident. You may be interested to know that the tactical computer in the Hornet had detected the presence of, and subsequently locked onto your hostile radar equipment and automatically sent a jamming signal back to it. Furthermore, an air to ground missile aboard the fully armed aircraft had also automatically locked onto your equipment. Fortunately the Highly Trained Marine Pilot flying the Hornet recognized the situation for what it was, quickly responded to the missile system alert status and was able to override the automated defense system before the missile was launched and your hostile radar was destroyed. Thank you for your concerns. The story is almost certainly false for a number of highly technical reasons. First off, police radar is relatively weak — it doesn’t need to be strong, and you wouldn’t want to fry passing motorists or the police officers who use it daily. These units don’t have much range; a few miles or so is sufficient since the police officer needs to be in line-of-sight with the vehicle he’d like to track. Next, a number of different radar types (pulse, continuous-scan, doppler, and so on) are used for different purposes. Doppler radar is used for tracking the speed of an object, whether it’s a moving automobile or a particularly threatening thunderstorm. Pulse units are used for aerial and naval navigation as well as military applications; in the latter case their ON/OFF nature makes it slightly more difficult for an enemy to identify their source. Additionally, there are different types of scan profiles in use, such as circular, unidirectional,  bi-directional, helical, raster, palmer, conical, and track-while-scan. Police radar units are directional ones that send pulses in a relatively narrow cone in the direction the officer points the device. (This type of radar is used to prevent the operators from being exposed to the devices’ high-frequency radiation over long periods of time.) Therefore, it’s pretty unlikely that an officer pointing a hand-held unit at an incoming car would also manage to illuminate a flying aircraft — an intervening hill, a large building, or even heavy plant growth would block any stray signal. Surface-to-air missile (SAM) radars behave differently than handheld police units. Also, each type or model of radar gives off very specific characteristics, and the onboard systems in military planes can differentiate among these types of threats (e.g., a SAM-2 vs. a ZSU vs. an F-16). To quote from Info-Strategies’ web site, “Every radar produces a radio frequency (RF) signal with specific characteristics that differentiate it from all other signals and define its capabilities and limitations.” Excepting a case of incredible coincidence, the police radar wouldn’t be on the “threat” list. Also, SAM radar units are also relatively short range systems (30-50km), since the usual practice is to employ longer-range tracking stations to keep watch on incoming aircraft, then alert the SAM unit in the aircraft’s flight path of the impending arrival of the hostile plane. Building on the above, we also need to remember that radar is in common use all over the world, and Europe sports some densely-packed airspace. All aircraft are tracked by large, fixed stations in order to prevent mid-air collisions and other accidents. Thus, the Tornado in question was most likely being “painted” by multiple radar stations at various airports around the UK, and possibly also from the continent. A puny police traffic-enforcement radar signal wouldn’t even be noticed in all the noise. Next, and very important to our understanding of this legend, the systems on military aircraft will not automatically arm and fire offensive ordnance. This is the case  to specifically prevent incidents such as the one described in this story. There’s no way that the Tornado’s systems would auto-arm a missile, much less try to fire it without a human “go” signal. At any rate, a human operator in a non-wartime situation would need  explicit permission to fire at an enemy position; if the pilot in our story was alerted of a possible “threat” radar signal by an onboard system, he or she could simply confirm the source by checking the direction from which the signal was emanating. As the police unit was outside any military firing range it would be obvious from the start that the signal was not a threat or was merely a spurious contact. Lastly, there are glaring factual errors in the story itself. The “Sidewinder” is a heat-seeking air-to-air missile (AAM) designed for short-range strikes against attacking aircraft. In other variants of the story, an “ASRAAM” (also a heat-seeking AAM) is mentioned. Neither would ever be used against a ground-based target; instead an ALARM (Air-Launched Anti-Radar Missile), AGM-65A “Maverick,” or AS.30(L) air-to-surface missile (ASM) would be fired. Also, the act of “jamming” radar does not involve disabling the unit itself, but rather forces it to produce inaccurate or widely fluctuating results (or no results at all) in order to confuse the operator and any incoming missiles are attempting to “lock” onto the target. This urban legend seems to be a classic “warning against technology” tale, cautioning us against the development of systems that could somehow escape human control and cause havoc. Compare this tale with Cruise Control, in which a misunderstanding of the operation of an automotive device leads to a serious accident. Also think of  the Y2K craze, or even to recent stories of the purported existence of an automated “Armageddon” system called “Dead Hand” in Russia (which was supposedly about to fire all Soviet missiles on 1/1/2000 after the computers failed). All are about our fear of modern technology and how a possible lack of human control in a given situation spells disaster.",false,"Technology, police, Techno File, Techno-Industrial Terror"

The Miami-based National Hurricane Center said Dorian was packing maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 kph) as it churned an unpredictable path toward Florida. “Although fluctuations in intensity are possible early next week, Dorian is expected to remain a powerful hurricane during the next few days,” the NHC said in a statement on Friday. On Florida’s east coast, where Dorian’s winds are expected to quickly gather speed on Monday morning, residents snapped up bottled water, plywood and other supplies as fast as they could be restocked. Some gas stations had run out of fuel. “They’re buying everything and anything that applies to a hurricane, flashlights, batteries, generators,” said Amber Hunter, 30, assistant manager at Cape Canaveral’s ACE Handiman hardware store. In the Bahamas, evacuations were already underway, two days before Dorian is expected to bring a life-threatening storm surge forecast at up to 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 meters) to the northwest of the islands. NHC Director Ken Graham saw a worrying, unpredictable situation for Florida, with the hurricane set to hit land somewhere up its east coast and potentially linger over the state, spinning slowly. “Slow is not our friend, the longer you keep this around the more rain we get,” Graham said in a Facebook Live video. It was unclear where the hurricane would hit land, but the results were expected to be devastating: “Big-time impacts, catastrophic events, for some areas 140 mph winds, not a good situation,” said Graham. Mindful of that warning, Cocoa Beach Mayor Ben Malik was putting up storm shutters on his Florida home on Friday afternoon and worrying about the flooding Dorian could unleash on his barrier island town. “It’s slowed down, we’re looking at a multiple-day event, we were hoping it would just barrel through and leave,” Malik said of forecasts that Dorian could sit over Florida for up to two days, dumping up to 18 inches (46 cm) of water. “I’m really worried about the amount of rain we’ll be getting.”  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis urged residents to have in reserve at least a week’s worth of food, water and medicine. President Donald Trump told reporters before leaving for Camp David for the weekend: “We’re thinking about Florida evacuations, but it’s a little bit too soon. We’ll probably make that determination on Sunday.”  But Fort Pierce Mayor Linda Hudson urged its 46,000 residents who planned to evacuate not to delay. “It’s decision time now. Don’t wait until I-95 north and I-75 north and the turnpike are parking lots,” said Hudson, who experienced two devastating hurricanes in 2004. Dorian’s course remains unpredictable. One of Florida’s last major hurricanes, 2017’s Irma, swept up the peninsula, instead of hitting the east coast. Florida residents like Jamison Weeks, general manager at Conchy Joe’s Seafood in Port St. Lucie, planned on staying put. “I’m planning on boarding up my house this evening,” said  Weeks. “The mood is a little tense, everybody’s a little nervous and just trying to prepare as best as possible.”  In the Bahamas, Freeport’s international airport was set to close on Friday night and not reopen until Sept. 3, amid worries that Dorian will slam tourist hotspots on the archipelago. Dorian began on Friday over the Atlantic as a Category 2 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale. By Friday night it was moving at nearly 10 mph (16 kph), giving it time to intensify before making landfall. Two thousand National Guard troops will have been mobilized for the hurricane by the end of Friday, with 2,000 more joining them on Saturday. Florida officials also were making sure all nursing homes and assisted living facilities had generators. Only one in five Florida nursing homes plans to rely on deliveries of temporary generators to keep their air conditioners running if Dorian knocks out power, a state agency said on Friday, short of the standard set by a law passed after a dozen people died in a sweltering nursing home after 2017’s Hurricane Irma. North of Cape Canaveral, the Kennedy Space Center’s 400-foot (122-m) launch tower was dragged inside a towering vehicle assembly building to shelter it from Dorian, a video posted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-owned space launch center showed.",true,"Foreign Policy, PunditFact, Lawrence O'Donnell, "

Forest, who has accused Cooper of reopening business sectors arbitrarily, tweeted that North Carolina is one of only four states that hasn't reopened gyms. Most other states have reopened gyms with restrictions. And in a couple states, gyms opened after a court ruling -- not the governor's orders. But his claim is generally accurate.",Paul Specht,"Gov. Roy Cooper has kept gyms and fitness centers closed during the coronavirus outbreak, drawing criticism from his Republican challenger. The number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations has been steadily rising in the Tar Heel state, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Cooper has said he worries that the heavy breathing associated with exercise could increase the spread of the virus. But Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, the Republican who hopes to unseat Cooper in November, criticized the governor for picking pandemic ""winners and losers."" On Monday, Forest said North Carolina is one of only a fraction of states keeping gyms closed. ""Now, 46 states have gyms/fitness centers open - North Carolina is one of four states that does not,"" Forest tweeted. Is that ? Generally speaking, yes. Some states are taking a regional approach to reopening gyms. In those states, gyms are allowed to open in some counties but not others. Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and North Carolina are the only states where governors are keeping gyms closed across the board. Our review of virus-related executive orders tracked by CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post and the National Governors Association backs up Forest’s assessment. Our review of these websites found that Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and North Carolina are the only states keeping gyms closed across the board. Most other states have either reopened gyms with restrictions, or reopened gyms in some areas but not others. For example, in California, gyms are allowed to reopen in all but seven counties. In Pennsylvania, 54 of the state’s 67 counties had entered a ""green phase"" by June 19, meaning gyms could reopen at reduced capacity. But 13 counties remained in the ""yellow phase,"" meaning their gyms were still closed. Things are moving a little slower in Washington, where less than half of the state’s 39 counties have entered Phase 3. That’s the phase when gyms can reopen at less than 50% capacity, according to the Seattle Times. In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer allowed some gyms to open on June 10, while others remained closed because they didn’t meet the state’s qualifications to reopen. But a federal judge recently halted the order, allowing all gyms to open on June 25. They’ll remain closed if Whitmer’s appeal is successful. A similar situation happened in Wisconsin, too. Gov. Tony Evers didn’t lift his ban on gym operations. The ban was dissolved after the state Supreme Court struck down his stay-at-home order. Forest tweeted that ""46 states have gyms/fitness centers open"" and that ""North Carolina is one of four states that does not."" Our review found that North Carolina, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts are the only states where gyms remain closed across the state. It’s worth noting that, in other states, government leaders are opening gyms in some counties, but not others. But Forest’s wording is broad enough to account for that variation.

""They claim pandemics only happen once every 100 years, but what if that is no longer true? We want to be ready, early, for the next one. Because clearly, the Obama administration did not leave any kind of game plan for something like this,"" said McConnell. This claim caught our attention because its definitive nature was directly at odds with the position of some former Obama administration officials, who immediately disputed it and started circulating on social media the link to such a plan. We reached out to McConnell’s press team to ask for the basis of his statement. McConnell’s spokesperson David Popp said in an emailed response that ""this is a unique crisis and we are all adapting to the public health and economic challenges."" In terms of the pandemic’s economic impact, he said there was ""definitely no playbook there"" and instead credited McConnell with his work on the CARES act, a coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress. Soon after McConnell made his playbook comment, Ronald Klain, who was the White House Ebola response coordinator from October 2014 to February 2015, tweeted out a link to a document titled ""Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents."" The document, originally unearthed in March by Politico, is a 69-page National Security Council guidebook developed in 2016 with the goal of assisting leaders ""in coordinating a complex U.S. Government response to a high-consequence emerging disease threat anywhere in the world."" It outlined questions to ask, who should be asked to get the answers and what key decisions should be made. Nicole Lurie, another Obama administration official, confirmed to us the existence of the NSC pandemic playbook and also said similar documents were created for the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""To say there was no playbook was ridiculous,"" said Lurie, who served as the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS during both terms of the Obama administration. The playbook lists types of infectious disease threats that could emerge. ""Novel coronaviruses"" were among pathogens flagged as having potential to cause heightened concern. Lurie said that there were tabletop exercises, which included planning for a pandemic-like situation, during the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations. (The Trump administration also conducted an exercise — known as ""Crimson Contagion"" — in 2019.) Other Obama-era officials offered similar stories in interviews this week with CNN: ""They were extensively briefed, to the extent that they paid attention to these things during the transition,"" said Jeremy Konyndyk, who directed USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. ""We absolutely did leave a plan. It was called a playbook,"" said Lisa Monaco, who was a former homeland security adviser to President Obama  The goal, she said, was to share the lessons learned during Ebola and Zika. Meanwhile, Peter Loge, who served as a senior adviser within Obama’s Food and Drug Administration, told KHN he remembered a very clear message from the HHS secretary regarding the presidential transition. ""Our job was to set up the Trump political staff for success, and we took that mandate very seriously,"" said Loge. He and his colleagues wrote memos to inform the Trump staff about priority issues. ""But nobody called me and asked what I was doing in my job,"" said Loge. However, the Trump administration has maintained that the coronavirus sneaked up on the U.S., and Trump himself has even said it was a ""very unforeseen thing."" But, in a May 14 exchange with reporters on the White House lawn, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany acknowledged the existence of the Obama pandemic playbook, even holding it up to show the press. She also dismissed its usefulness. ""The Obama-Biden plan that has been referenced was insufficient. It wasn’t going to work. What our administration did under the leadership of President Trump was do an entire 2018 pandemic preparedness report,"" said McEnany. Trump, who was standing nearby, agreed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Obama administration did not leave behind a ""game plan"" for a pandemic. That’s wrong. Multiple Obama-era officials have said they left a 2016 ""pandemic playbook"" that detailed exact steps to take in the event of an infectious disease outbreak. The White House press secretary even held up the actual document on the White House lawn. There has been discussion in recent days as to whether the Obama plan was dated because it dealt with lessons learned from earlier outbreaks that may not apply to the current pandemic. Still, McConnell’s statement focused only on whether any such ""game plan"" existed, and ample evidence suggests it did. We rate it .

This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment)."" New CDC research conducted on the Diamond Princess cruise ship found traces of the coronavirus on some of the ship’s surfaces up to 17 days after passengers disembarked. But traces are not the same thing as live viruses. The report doesn’t conclude that the virus ""survived"" on any of the surfaces that long and the CDC hasn’t issued an official statement that gives that assessment, either.

We previously looked at how long the virus can survive on certain surfaces in a recent fact-check and found research suggesting it can live for up to three hours in the air, four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard and three days on plastic and stainless steel. It’s important to note that the study hasn’t been peer-reviewed and more research is needed.

It was penned by Sarah McCann, who writes online about food-related matters, including recipes, warning about the purported dangers of spoiled onions. (The pen name “Zola Gorgon” is a play on gorgonzola, a veined blue Italian cheese known for its strong flavor and distinctive odor.) Spoiled Onions Written by Zola Gorgon – author of several cookbooks. Watch out for those spoiled onions… I had the wonderful privilege of touring Mullins Food Products. Mullins is HUGE and is owned by 11 brothers and sisters in the Mullins family. My friend Jeanne is the CEO. The facility is mammoth. We toured about 280,000 square feet! Questions about food poisoning came up and I wanted to share what I learned from a chemist. The guy who gave us our tour is named Ed. He’s one of the brothers. Ed is a chemistry expert and is involved in developing most of the sauce formula. He’s even developed sauce formula for McDonald’s. Keep in mind that Ed is a food chemistry whiz. During the tour, someone asked if we really needed to worry about mayonnaise. People are always worried that mayonnaise will spoil. Ed’s answer will surprise you. Ed said that all commercially-made Mayo is completely safe. “It doesn’t even have to be refrigerated. No harm in refrigerating it, but it’s not really necessary.” He explained that the pH in mayonnaise is set at a point that bacteria could not survive in that environment. He then talked about the quint essential picnic, with the bowl of potato salad sitting on the table and how everyone blames the mayonnaise when someone gets sick. Ed says that when food poisoning is reported, the first thing the officials look for is when the ‘victim’ last ate ONIONS and where those onions came from (in the potato salad?). Ed says it’s not the mayonnaise (as long as it’s not homemade Mayo) that spoils in the outdoors. It’s probably the onions, and if not the onions, it’s the POTATOES. He explained, onions are a huge magnet for bacteria, especially uncooked onions. You should never plan to keep a portion of a sliced onion. He says it’s not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag and put it in your refrigerator. It’s already contaminated enough just by being cut open and out for a bit, that it can be a danger to you (and doubly watch out for those onions you put in your hotdogs at the baseball park!) Ed says if you take the leftover onion and cook it like crazy you’ll probably be okay, but if you slice that leftover onion and put on your sandwich, you’re asking for trouble. Both the onions and the moist potato in a potato salad, will attract and grow bacteria faster than any commercial mayonnaise will even begin to break down. So, how’s that for news? Take it for what you will. I (the author) am going to be very careful about my onions from now on. For some reason, I see a lot of credibility coming from a chemist and a company, that produces millions of pounds of mayonnaise every year.’ Also, dogs should NEVER eat onions. Their stomachs cannot metabolize onions. Mike Mullins of Mullins Food Products had this to say about the tour of his company’s facilities that resulted in the Internet rumor about food poisonings from onions and mayonnaise: There is some truth to the story, but the two examples from the plant tour look to have been combined. The potato in the potato salad is much more likely to spoil than the mayo. […] The ph level for mayonaise is in the low 4’s and is a poor environment for the growth of many of the organisms that can make you ill. A good rule of thumb is that if it is sold at room temperature in your retail store that it is probably safe. Any product can be mishandled and when left in suitable temperatures for growth the products can become unsafe for consumption. Often times what is mixed with mayo or salad dressings (tuna, potatoes, vegetables, etc.) can become more readily contaminated than the base of the salad dressing or mayonaise. The second example used on the tour referred to the onions. The example given was that in a warm environment an onion that was sliced is a great environment for growth. The ballpark example referred to the hot dog dressing table where fresh onions were put on top of onions that already started to show contamination. Onions are easily contaminated once the protection of the outer skin has been removed. Onions, potatoes, and eggs are handled with extreme care in the food industry once the outer layer of protection has been removed. Quite a few food poisonings have been traced back to onion contaminations, and we throw out onions after 10 days even though we cook any onions we use in our facility. The stories were used as examples for “old wives tales” for various foods. The mayo is usually the ingredient that gets the blame and we try to point out that there might be a lot more going on than meets the eye. As to the content of the article, it is true that commercially-prepared mayonnaise is hardly the food poisoning menace it is widely believed to be. A study conducted by researchers at the University of Wisconsin’s Food Research Institute in late 1980 and early 1981 (results published in the Journal of Food Protection in February 1982) showed that mayonnaise actually inhibited the growth of some bacteria in food. Its high acid content, gained from the incorporation of ingredients like vinegar or lemon juice into the product, slows bacterial growth. “When you add the mayonnaise to your salad, you decrease the PH of that salad. It makes it more of a hostile environment for that bacteria,” said Michael P. Doyle, an assistant professor of agriculture and life sciences at the university. Salt in the condiment also works to prevent spoilage. However, mayonnaise is still not a substitute for keeping food cold. Also, homemade mayo, which is made from raw eggs, poses the threat of salmonella poisoning. (The eggs used in commercially-prepared mayonnaise have been pasteurized.) The claims made in the article about onions (and to a lesser extent, potatoes) are harder to substantiate. Germ transmission does occur more quickly when surfaces nasty microbes are lurking on or items that become contaminated by them are wet rather than dry; but it’s a great leap from realizing that cut surfaces of onions and potatoes are wet to concluding either of these vegetables are “a huge magnet for bacteria.” Also, cut bulb onions are highly acidic; the act of slicing them causes the enzymes they contain to generate sulphenic acids, the gas form of which has made many an unwary onion chopper cry. Given that it is mayonnaise’s acidity that retards the growth of bacteria, it’s hard to conclude that cut onions would be a hospitable place for germs or bacteria to take up residence, let alone a magnet that drew them from the air. However, long-standing superstition posits that very thing. It has long been asserted that keeping a plate of cut raw onions in the house will draw illness-causing germs from the air, thereby rendering the home free of contamination. These print sightings gathered by folklorists Iona Opie and Moira Tatum showcase that belief:  [1956] The onion is cut up and stood in an old tin-plate. Then you place it in the room where the sick child sleeps. The onion draws the complaint into itself, and when the child is better care must be taken to see that the onion is properly burnt. [1964] When there’s flu about, I puts a plate of cut up onion in every room. That’s what keeps colds away … All the cold germs goes into they. [1978] I fondly remember the smell of my mother’s window sill adorned with half onions. She swore by the legend that the onions captured any incoming germs and purified the air. Mind you, superstition also asserts that it is unlucky to keep cut onions around, as these additional sightings gathered by Opie and Tatum demonstrate: [1855] To have a cut onion lying about in the house breeds distempers. [1891] An old servant (Essex) … recently complained that … Spanish onions … were too big. When an obvious method of getting over that difficulty was suggested, she replied, ‘Oh, no! that would never do! It’s so unlucky to have a cut onion in the house.’ [1958] Special small onions are being grown for me as I am liable to keep half a cut onion from one meal to another, which I am assured is highly dangerous. Are cut bulb onions therefore a health scourge one must be on guard against? No scientific evidence points in that direction. What reports there are that tie onions to outbreaks of food poisoning almost exclusively name green onions (also known as long onions or scallions) as the culprit. Although both sorts could be exposed to e. coli and other nasties during their time in the ground or while being handled during the move to market, green onions are chopped up and eaten as is, whereas the paperish brown peel that covers bulb onions and which is discarded rather than ingested acts as a shield against contamination.",false,"Food, Food Contamination"

With Georgia’s Republican presidential primary just a few weeks away, the four remaining candidates and their supporters are expected to blanket the airwaves with attack ads in this delegate-rich state. One that we’ve seen -- scheduled to hit the airwaves Wednesday -- takes aim at former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who represented portions of Atlanta’s western suburbs for 20 years in Congress. ""He co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy,"" says the voice in the ad paid for by Restore Our Future. The super PAC is run by supporters of Republican hopeful Mitt Romney. There’s nothing that makes conservatives see more red than a reference to Pelosi, the liberal California congresswoman and House minority leader. Or talking about China for that matter. The ad that will soon be on your TV screens in Georgia is different than what Restore Our Future aired in Florida and South Carolina before their primaries. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Florida looked into this claim. We wondered: Did the group get its facts right this time? Gingrich is ahead in the polls in Georgia, a state where he desperately needs to do well to keep his campaign from becoming an episode of ""The Walking Dead."" His GOP rivals, particularly Romney, are trying to make Gingrich work hard for every vote here. Romney made a campaign stop in Atlanta last week and took a couple of shots at Gingrich. Restore Our Future has another ad on its website that says Gingrich ""is no Ronald Reagan."" The Georgia ad contains the same language as the one that aired in Florida and South Carolina. Here’s some more detail about the issue:  Restore Our Future refers to House Resolution 1078, which was introduced on Feb. 22, 1989, before Gingrich became speaker and when Democrats had control of the House of Representatives. The legislation was called the Global Warming Prevention Act of 1989. It set national goals to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and encouraged international agreements to address global warming, PolitiFact Florida reported. It required the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor global warming and create plans for future action. It supported stricter fuel standards for cars and alternative energy. It also sent money to developing countries to encourage practices that reduce carbon emissions. The bill had several hearings but received unfavorable reviews from the administration of George H.W. Bush and never became law. The resolution was introduced by Rep. Claudine Schneider, a Rhode Island Republican who left Congress in 1991. Yes, Gingrich and Pelosi co-sponsored the bill. In all, there were 144 House members who sponsored the legislation. Most were Democrats, but there were a handful of Republicans in the mix, such as Olympia Snowe of Maine and Jim Kolbe of Arizona. China’s one-child policy generally refers to the government’s efforts to limit population growth to one child per couple. Human rights advocates say the policy has resulted in forced sterilizations and abortions. The Restore Our Future website says the $60 million went to the United Nations Population Fund and that President Ronald Reagan withheld funds from the program after he determined the program, which supports family planning and contraception, was supporting Chinese actions. The bill did propose money for the United Nations Population Fund. But Section 1102, Part C, of the bill prohibits using any of the funds for ""the performance of involuntary sterilization or abortion or to coerce any person to accept family planning."" That is the exact opposite of the language in Restore Our Future’s ad about Gingrich. The language is the same in this ad. And the facts haven’t changed.",false,"Georgia, Message Machine 2012, Restore Our Future, "
979,27951,A photograph shows a child in a famine-stricken country crawling on the ground while a vulture waits in the background.,"September 12, 2008","Kevin Carter’s life (and death) was the subject of the 2004 documentary, The Life of Kevin Carter.",David Mikkelson,"If a hundred of the most talented members of the advertising industry were tasked with creating an image to illustrate the concepts of poverty and famine, quite possibly none of them would come up with anything nearly as grippingly and devastatingly effective as a 1993 picture snapped by South African freelance photographer Kevin Carter:  The PHOTO in the mail is the “Pulitzer prize” winning photo taken in 1994 during the Sudan famine. The picture depicts a famine stricken child crawling towards an United Nations food camp, located a kilometer away. The vulture is waiting for the child to die so that it can eat it. This picture shocked the whole world. No one knows what happened to the child, including the photographer Kevin Carter who left the place as soon as the photograph was taken. Three months later he committed suicide due to depression. This was found in his diary, “Dear God, I promise I will never waste my food no matter how bad it can taste and how full I may be I pray that He will protect this little boy, guide and deliver him away from his misery. I pray that we will be more sensitive towards the world around us and not be blinded be our own selfish nature and interests.” I hope this picture will always serve as a reminder to us that how fortunate we are and that we must never ever take things for granted. His poignant photograph of an emaciated toddler who collapsed from hunger on her way to a feeding center in famine-ravaged Sudan while a vulture ominously loomed in the background was originally published in the New York Times (which later described it as “a metaphor for Africa’s despair”) and earned Carter the 1994 Pulitzer Prize in the Feature Photography category, and the image has since become widely known as a metaphor for Africa’s despair. As described in Time magazine, the scene Carter captured in his now-famous photograph was one he stumbled across during a trip he made on his own in order to cover the civil strife in war-torn Sudan:  In 1993 Carter headed north of the border with [friend and fellow journalist] João Silva to photograph the rebel movement in famine-stricken Sudan. To make the trip, Carter had taken a leave from the [South Africa] Weekly Mail and borrowed money for the air fare. Immediately after their plane touched down in the village of Ayod, Carter began snapping photos of famine victims. Seeking relief from the sight of masses of people starving to death, he wandered into the open bush. He heard a soft, high-pitched whimpering and saw a tiny girl trying to make her way to the feeding center. As he crouched to photograph her, a vulture landed in view. Careful not to disturb the bird, he positioned himself for the best possible image. He would later say he waited about 20 minutes, hoping the vulture would spread its wings. It did not, and after he took his photographs, he chased the bird away and watched as the little girl resumed her struggle. Afterward he sat under a tree, lit a cigarette, talked to God and cried. “He was depressed afterward,” Silva recalls. “He kept saying he wanted to hug his daughter.” After another day in Sudan, Carter returned to Johannesburg. Coincidentally, the New York Times, which was looking for pictures of Sudan, bought his photograph and ran it on March 26, 1993. The picture immediately became an icon of Africa’s anguish. Hundreds of people wrote and called the Times asking what had happened to the child (the paper reported that it was not known whether she reached the feeding center); and papers around the world reproduced the photo. Friends and colleagues complimented Carter on his feat. His self-confidence climbed. But Kevin Carter was also a troubled soul, struggling with issues such as financial insecurity, drug problems, failed relationships, and the horrors of having witnessed multiple scenes of death — enough of a burden for anyone to struggle with, but in Carter’s case a burden made extra-heavy by the critical condemnation heaped upon him for taking the photograph that had made him world-famous:  Though the photo helped draw enormous attention to the humanitarian crisis that was engulfing Sudan, it was criticized by others who felt that Carter should have helped the girl and was instead exploiting her suffering for his gain. The real vulture, they said in vitriolic hate mail, was Carter himself. Some photojournalists might have easily dismissed such criticism, but it hit Carter hard and fed his self-doubts. On 27 July 1994, barely two months after having received his Pulitzer Prize, 33-year-old Kevin Carter could shoulder that burden no more and took his own life:  The Braamfonteinspruit is a small river that cuts southward through Johannesburg’s northern suburbs — and through Parkmore, where the Carters once lived. At around 9 p.m., Kevin Carter backed his red Nissan pickup truck against a blue gum tree at the Field and Study Center. He had played there often as a little boy. The Sandton Bird Club was having its monthly meeting there, but nobody saw Carter as he used silver gaffer tape to attach a garden hose to the exhaust pipe and run it to the passenger-side window. Wearing unwashed Lee jeans and an Esquire T-shirt, he got in and switched on the engine. Then he put music on his Walkman and lay over on his side, using the knapsack as a pillow. The suicide note he left behind is a litany of nightmares and dark visions, a clutching attempt at autobiography, self-analysis, explanation, excuse. After coming home from New York, he wrote, he was “depressed … without phone … money for rent … money for child support … money for debts … money!!! … I am haunted by the vivid memories of killings & corpses & anger & pain … of starving or wounded children, of trigger-happy madmen, often police, of killer executioners … “  Although the purported diary entry (beginning “Dear God, I promise I will never waste my food”) that has been tacked onto this photograph may sound like something Kevin Carter might have written, those words were not recorded in his diary, nor are they known to have been written or spoken by him. They were added to the photograph by an unknown hand after the picture had been circulating on the Internet for several years.",true,Fauxtography
983,11525,Study shows children's best hope for the potassium and fiber missing in their diets is potatoes,"February 29, 2016","This news release is about a study funded by and written by the potato industry. And not surprisingly given its provenance, the news release advocates vigorously for the inclusion of more potatoes in children’s diets. Interestingly, though, the study that’s the basis for the release does not deliver the same message. Instead, it says that a broad array of vegetables are not being eaten by children and therefore children’s diets are lacking in calcium, vitamin D, and other nutrients. Potatoes are a big focus of the study, of course, but here’s where the news release falls short, too: The study notes — and the news release ignores — that the potatoes being studied included french fries and potato chips. All potential health harm from these foods is completely ignored. (Such harm is ignored in the study, too.) The potential benefits are not clearly broken out in the study and seem to appear out of nowhere in the news release. Childhood intake of nutrients has been linked to later development of cancer and cardiovascular disease, as well as obesity and diabetes. As the release states, childhood eating patterns carry over to adults. Encouraging kids to eat a wide variety of vegetables is therefore important. The argument that potatoes should be particularly encouraged has little foundation in science.","William Heisel,Kathleen Fairfield, MD, DrPH,Kathlyn Stone","There is no mention of costs. We won’t penalize the release for not including this information since potatoes are a common and relatively inexpensive food. The release could have noted the average cost of a pound of potatoes to give parents a sense of how they might fit into a family grocery budget. The release says that potatoes are the “best hope” for delivering more fiber and potassium to kids. Based on what evidence? The study certainly doesn’t show this. Here’s what the study concludes: “The results suggest that patterns of potassium, [dietary fiber], and vitamin D intake for young children should be studied further in order to develop strategies for increasing intakes of these crucial nutrients. The consumption of a variety of all vegetables, including [white potatoes], is important to increase potassium and [dietary fiber] intakes and should be encouraged.” The most troubling thing about this study and about the release is the inclusion of french fries and potato chips in the study as if they were equal in health value to other forms of potatoes. There is no discussion of the potential harms that come from foods high in sugar, salt, fat, and calories. The release skirts any explanation of how the study was conducted. The study itself appeared to be focused on overall dietary patterns, not potatoes per se. In addition, the study was published as a paid supplement to a journal article. In general, supplements are not peer-reviewed, and so it would be helpful to note specifically whether the papers in the supplement were peer reviewed or not. The release is somewhat cagey on this point, saying that the study was published “in a special supplement of the peer-reviewed journal Advances in Nutrition.” The release does not engage in disease mongering. The release notes: The supplement is the outcome of a November 2014 USDA/ARS Children’s Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine roundtable on vegetable consumption in children. The forum was supported by the Alliance for Potato Research and Education, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to expanding and translating scientific research into evidence-based policy and education initiatives that recognize the role of all forms of the potato–a nutritious vegetable–in promoting health for all age groups. That’s good information as far as it goes, but the release does not acknowledge that the authors of the main study that is the basis for the release are both paid by the Alliance (one is an employee, the other a consultant), which is a membership group for potato growers. There are many comparisons in the study but the release mentions none of the many other dietary sources of potassium and fiber. We think it’s obvious that potatoes are widely available. By claiming that potatoes are the best hope for increasing potassium and fiber intake in kids, we think the release needed to prove the novelty of the research and this finding. But there’s nothing new here. The headline – and use of “best hope” — is unjustified, as far as we can tell.",false,"Food,industry/commercial news releases"
984,14220,Research even shows that sending more girls to school can boost an entire country’s GDP.,"April 29, 2016","Michelle Obama said that research shows that sending girls to school can boost a country’s entire economy. That’s a fairly broad statement and broadly speaking, it’s accurate. Research from economists at the World Bank and elsewhere suggest that it’s possible that educating more girls produces a stronger economy. But researchers can’t say whether it’s the education of girls that leads to growth, or the growth that leads to more education of women. Plus, women can hit roadblocks in the job market even if they are educated. The research shows that, too. Obama’s statement is accurate but it needs additional information.",Jon Greenberg,"Among the causes First Lady Michelle Obama has championed during her time in the White House is improving the lot of girls and women worldwide. About a year ago, Obama helped kick off Let Girls Learn, an interagency effort focused on educating adolescent girls. ""Studies from the World Bank show that one extra year of secondary school can increase a girl's future income by 15 to 25 percent,"" Obama said in an interview with a U.S. Agency for International Development publication. ""And we know that when girls are educated, they are less likely to contract HIV, more likely to delay childbearing and vaccinate their children, and have lower maternal and infant mortality rates. Research even shows that sending more girls to school can boost an entire country’s GDP."" We’ve seen that claim about educating girls and a rising GDP before. Is it true? Largely, yes. Research does show that a higher percentage of girls in school correlates with a higher gross domestic product. But those findings are much more limited than many people understand. Behind all the research, there’s uncertainty about whether a stronger economy leads to more girls in school, or if more girls in school leads to a stronger economy. No single rule applies everywhere. A stronger economy, for instance, provides both the resources and incentives to educate more women, who go to school, earn more and boost the economy a little higher. But it doesn’t always work that way. In the Middle East and North Africa, more women might be educated but for social and religious reasons, they can’t work, or must work in jobs that don’t fully reward their level of education. And the biggest sticking point is that what’s been called the ""girl effect"" seems to be much stronger in middle-income countries. For poorer nations, the effect is more muted. A few key studies and cautions The White House press office backed up the First Lady’s claim by citing policy reports that declared that educating girls and young women would boost a country’s economy. One from the World Bank said ""By effectively educating more women -- that is, providing more women with a high-quality education -- more will enter the labor market, and the economy will show the favorable results."" Those reports didn’t actually give the underlying research, so we’ll cover the highlights. • A 2009 article in the journal Feminist Economics compared regions of the world and measured gender gaps in both education and employment. That’s worth noting because, while the two generally go hand-in-hand, they are separate. You can educate girls, but if companies won’t hire them, a lot of the economic benefit is lost. This study’s bottom line was that between 1960 and 2000, East Asia’s growth rate was .9 percent higher than the region of the Middle East-North Africa. The difference was due to the higher fraction of girls in school in East Asia. • A 2011 World Bank study took 14 countries and teased out what would happen if every girl finished whatever level of school she was in -- either primary or secondary. Not surprisingly, the economic impact depended hugely on a country’s starting point. India and China, for example, had very low rates of girls not completing school, while on the opposite end, places like Burundi and Senegal had dropout rates over 80 percent. So the study found that getting girls and young women to complete a given level of schooling added a ""barely noticeable"" amount in India and China, while in the other countries, researchers predicted a hefty rise. One important contribution of this research is it factored in the diminishing returns of educating more women. When more people hit the job market, it tends to drive wages down. There’s still a net gain, but in this study, earnings could be about 20 percent less than you might expect. Tuck that point away and keep it in mind for the next landmark analysis on our list. It provided advocacy groups with a talking point that has gone viral. • In a 1999 World Bank paper Gender inequality, income and growth: Are good times good for women?, economists David Dollar and Roberta Gatti worked with data on 100 nations. The finding that gained the most traction was that ""in the countries with higher initial education, an increase of 1 percentage point in the share of adult women with secondary school education implies an increase in per capita income growth of 0.3 percentage points."" That might seem like a simple equation, but it actually makes two points that are often overlooked. The economic growth took place only in middle-income countries that already had a higher rate of educating women. ""For the poorer half of the observations, there is no relationship between female attainment and income,"" the authors wrote. The other generally ignored element is that the 1 percent increase in educated women applies to completing secondary education. Simply putting more girls in classrooms at any grade level wouldn’t necessarily deliver the same results. You have to get the girls all the way through high school. Specifics are important when measuring education gains Here’s where many organizations, including USAID, get into trouble. They say -- right now on their website -- that ""if 10 percent more girls attend school, a country’s GDP increases by an average of 3 percent."" That statement has three flaws. First, it treats all nations the same, whether they are low income or middle income. Second, it treats all education the same, whether it’s primary or secondary. Perhaps most troubling is it scales up the original equation by a factor of 10. Dollar, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told us that doing that ""is a bit risky."" ""You would expect diminishing returns,"" he said. Which takes us back to that 2011 World Bank study we tucked away. It predicted wages would be about 20 percent lower than you would expect. Less money in women’s pockets means less economic activity, and less economic growth. Our ruling Michelle Obama said that research shows that sending girls to school can boost a country’s entire economy. That’s a fairly broad statement and broadly speaking, it’s accurate. Research from economists at the World Bank and elsewhere suggest that it’s possible that educating more girls produces a stronger economy. But researchers can’t say whether it’s the education of girls that leads to growth, or the growth that leads to more education of women. Plus, women can hit roadblocks in the job market even if they are educated. The research shows that, too. Obama’s statement is accurate but it needs additional information.

985,31561,Using toilet paper as a barrier between your derriere and a toilet seat poses more health risks than just sitting down without a barrier.,"April 6, 2017","Ultimately, what you put between yourself and the toilet seat is between you and your toilet, but we rate these claims because a.) you are not reducing risk of spreading germs by failing to put down toilet paper, and b.) you are, likewise, certainly not increasing the risk by putting down toilet paper. The risk of germs is omnipresent, and it should, if anything, highlight the importance of washing your hands after using the bathroom.",Alex Kasprak,"On 23 June 2016, Hefty.co published an article with the headline “After You Read This, You’ll Never Put Toilet Paper on the Seat Again. Never.” The piece attempted to make the argument that, due to germs released to the air when a toilet is flushed combined with superior germ prevention abilities of toilet seats, there would be more germs on the paper barrier than on the seat itself: For a long time, people thought the seats were covered in germs and nasties and people could pick up all kinds of horrible gastrointestinal infections from them. But given their special shape and their particularly smooth surfaces, toilet seats actually prevent bacteria from settling on them. In addition, germs cannot multiply on bare skin, so mere contact with the toilet seat is not so bad after all. Toilet paper, on the other hand, is a completely different story. It’s common knowledge that (almost) no one puts the toilet lid down after using and flushing the toilet. As a result, all those germs spread around the room and also on the toilet paper. And contrary to the toilet seat, toilet paper is an ideal place for germs to gather. Its surface makes it easy for bacteria to settle on. It is precisely this germ-infested toilet paper that you would reach out to grab with your hands and then, unconsciously, you would touch your face, allowing the bacteria the easiest passageway into your body. There is a glaring logical fallacy in this argument that essentially makes debunking the science behind it unnecessary: Presumably, you will still be touching that same toilet paper with your hands when you reach for it to wipe; as well, you might “unconsciously… touch your face, allowing the bacteria the easiest passageway into your body.” We are not going to take that easy route out, though, because the science presented is not only illogical, it is factually inaccurate. The article’s central argument is that there is unlikely to be any appreciable amount of bacteria on the seat itself and that there would be, comparatively speaking, more on the toilet paper. These are actually questions scientists have addressed on multiple occasions in peer-reviewed journals. For example, a 1975 study (“Microbiological Hazards of Household Toilets”) used both laboratory work and “fieldwork” in public bathrooms to reveal that, while flushing a toilet does allow bacteria and viruses to “remain airborne long enough to settle on surfaces throughout the bathroom”, the samples most consistently showing the most bacteria was the seats of the toilet, not the walls or other surfaces near it. A study published in 2005, using its own experimental data as well as a review of literature on the topic, reached a similar conclusion: Epidemiological studies from recurrent outbreaks of norovirus infection in successive cohorts of guests in hotels and on cruise ships […] suggests spread from infected persons after vomiting by settling of aerosol particles onto surfaces which are then touched by hands. In addition, these studies suggested that splashing or aerosol generation during toilet flushing may spread virus particles onto contact surfaces such as the toilet seat or flush handle. Combined with our experimental data we believe that the potential spread of enteric disease by contact with surfaces in bathrooms harbouring pathogens cannot be ignored and must be regarded as a serious infection risk. So yes, flushing can liberate pathogens into the air and allow them to settle on a variety of bathroom surfaces (pretty much all of them, according to the 2005 study), but given that these pathogens’ most common area of detection is the toilet seat, whatever magical anti-germ power it is supposed to have is not doing its job, or more likely is nonexistent. To that point, experiments have demonstrated that pathogens on non-porous surfaces (such as the toilet seat) are more easily transferred to the skin than from porous ones (such as toilet paper). The post also makes the argument that putting the seat cover down reduces the risks of introducing pathogens to the air and, as a result, bathroom surface; as we now know, this would certainly increase the risk of transferring pathogens to your hands as well. But this claim, as well, flies in the face of the experimental results presented in that 2005 study: Experiments were carried out to establish the dynamics of aerosol formation and surface contamination after seeding the toilet with [both a bacterial and viral pathogen]. Closing the toilet lid had little effect in reducing the number of bacteria released into the air […]. The highest level of surface contamination was closest to the aerosol source, at the toilet seat level […]. The final false claim of this viral (and bacterial!) post is that “germs cannot multiply on bare skin”. Broadly speaking, this is not true. Logically speaking, it is also fairly irrelevant. The mechanism that is discussed throughout the Hefty.co post is not an infection on the skin, but transfer to the mouth from the hands. As you need only a small number of pathogens to enter your gastrointestinal tract, and because many pathogens can survive on a variety of surfaces for extended periods of time, the purported lack of “multiplication” on your skin is no protection from infection if there should be any contact between your hand and your buttocks (or anything else your buttocks may have come in contact with).",false,"Medical, hefty.co, pathogens, toilet"

The new lane on MoPac ""would be a high occupancy lane,"" Leffingwell said. ""It would be reserved for bus rapid transit and express buses and for registered car pools. It would also facilitate the movement of emergency vehicles such as police, fire and EMS vehicles. There has been some discussion of placing a variable toll on that lane only, not on the rest of MoPac, which would make it usable for folks in their private automobiles to use. It would be a variable-type toll depending on the movement of traffic in that lane to make sure it moves quickly. … If the speed goes down, the toll would go up. If the speed goes up, the toll would go down. That’s under discussion right now, and hopefully, that project will begin in 2014."" Shea shot back: ""All the transportation experts that I’ve spoken with have said you might call it an HOV lane, but it’s really a toll lane. And the mayor has voted for it in the three-year TIP transportation plan."" Shea was more blunt in a recent mailer to voters, saying: ""Lee voted for a toll lane on MoPac."" Over the years, various ideas have been floated to relieve congestion on MoPac, which opened in the 1970s. The current plan — to be built and operated by the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority, with most of the funding from the Texas Department of Transportation — includes adding an ""express lane"" to each side of MoPac for the approximately 11-mile stretch from Lady Bird Lake north to Parmer Lane. At the debate, Leffingwell described the additional lanes as ""high occupancy."" Then again, the MoPac express lanes wouldn’t be the same as the ""high occupancy vehicle,"" or HOV, lanes found in some urban areas. Often called ""car-pool lanes,"" they are typically reserved for vehicles carrying more than one or two people; some allow solo drivers to use them if they pay a toll. But Central Texas never adopted the HOV strategy, according to a Jan. 30, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, ""and the MoPac express lanes won’t change that."" Instead, as Leffingwell indicated, the additional northbound and southbound lanes would be open — for no charge — to transit buses, registered vanpools and emergency and military vehicles. Everyone else who wanted to hop in the express lane would have to pay a toll, the amount of which would change minute by minute depending on the level of traffic in the lane. The article quoted Mike Heiligenstein, executive director of the mobility authority, as saying that the point of the fluctuating tolls is to keep the speeds in each express lane at 50 mph or more. While there are no MoPac toll lanes yet, construction could start as early as 2013, according to an April 2, 2012, Statesman news article. The project is expected to receive final environmental clearance from the federal government around August 2012, which would trigger a six-month period in which approval can be challenged in court. We wondered how Leffingwell factored into the toll-lane plan. Shea told us that she was referring to three votes Leffingwell cast in 2010 as a board member for the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization. That’s a regional body whose primary jobs, according to its website, are to coordinate regional transportation planning and to approve the use of federal transportation funds within the region. The 19-member CAMPO board is made up mostly of local elected officials from Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties. CAMPO director Maureen McCoy told us that Leffingwell, who was elected mayor in 2009 and was a council member before that, joined the board in 2008. To back up her claim, Shea sent us copies of the minutes of CAMPO board meetings that struck us as showing that Leffingwell did vote for toll lanes on MoPac. Let’s look closer:  ** Vote No. 1: On May 24, 2010, the board voted to adopt Central Texas’ 25-year transportation plan, with Leffingwell and 16 others voting ""aye."" The plan, which is required under federal law, undergoes a top-to-bottom rewrite every five years. Any road or transit project that uses federal money, as most of them do, must be in the plan to qualify for that money. A May 10, 2010, Statesman news article previewing the vote said the proposed CAMPO 2035 plan contained several hundred road, rail, bicycle and pedestrian projects projected to cost nearly $30 billion. It noted that in the plan was $392 million for a new ""managed lane"" in each direction on MoPac from Parmer Lane in North Austin to Slaughter Lane in South Austin. The plan that the board approved in May 2010 includes the MoPac ""managed lanes"" project in its ""priority project list."" And a separate chart in the plan lists the MoPac project in a section labeled ""toll roads and toll express lanes."" Several months after the vote, in July 2010, state and local officials announced that the proposed MoPac project, with express toll lanes between Parmer Lane and the river, was moving forward after delays of several years, according to a July 8, 2010, Statesman news article. ** Vote No. 2: On Aug. 9, 2010, the CAMPO board voted to adopt the 2011-2014 Transportation Improvement Program, a short-term document that designates projects to be carried out over the next four years and how they will be funded. (Shea erred slightly in the debate by describing it as a three-year document.) Leffingwell was among the 16 board members who voted for the plan, which included the ""managed lanes"" project for MoPac between Parmer Lane and the river. In a telephone interview, we asked McCoy, the CAMPO director, whether she considered Leffingwell’s 2010 votes for the long-range plan and the TIP as votes to add a toll lane to MoPac. She said yes, saying that the projects had been discussed for some time. ** Vote No. 3: On Sept. 13, 2010, the board voted 13-4, with Leffingwell’s support, to approve the ""terms and conditions"" for the MoPac express lane project, as required by state law. According to a summary in the agenda for that meeting, the ""terms and conditions,"" developed by the mobility authority and TxDOT, establish that the project would add an express lane in the Parmer-to-the-river stretch of MoPac ""consistent with the CAMPO 2035 Regional Transportation Plan and the current Transportation Improvement Program."" They also establish that the toll rate for the project would be ""variable based on traffic demand with a minimum rate of 22 cents per mile"" and that emergency, military and transit vehicles would be exempt. Finally, it notes that the toll rates would increase annually based on the ""Consumer Price Index for Urban Areas."" As we closed out this review, Andy Mormon, Leffingwell’s city chief of staff, said in a telephone interview that to describe the MoPac project’s ""managed lanes"" as ""toll lanes"" oversimplifies a complex traffic solution project. He also suggested that Shea’s claim leaves out critical context in that under the regional plan, drivers could continue using MoPac without paying tolls. ""When you say toll lane in Austin, there’s a lot of people who get up in arms,"" he said. Our ruling During the debate, Shea responded to Leffingwell’s description of the plan to add a managed lane to each side of a stretch of MoPac by calling it a toll lane and saying Leffingwell had voted for it in a transportation plan. Our conclusion is that except for a select few kinds of motorists, drivers who use the new lanes would have to pay varying tolls. And Leffingwell voted for this approach thrice. Shea did not say MoPac would be entirely tolled. Her comment had the context already given at the debate by the mayor. We rate her claim .",true,"Transportation, Texas, Brigid Shea, "
990,2037,Quake amputees embody resilience in broken Haiti.,"January 10, 2011","Sprinting on their crutches at breakneck speed, the young soccer players who lost legs in Haiti’s earthquake last year project a symbol of hope and resilience in a land where so much is broken.",Tom Brown,"A member of an amputee soccer team hits the ball during a training session for an upcoming exhibition match in Port-au-Prince January 8, 2011. REUTERS/Kena Betancur Playing a weekend warm-up match days before the anniversary of the devastating January 12 quake, the players control the ball artfully with their good legs, avoiding “illegal” contact with their crutches. The teams train on a dusty pitch near Cite Soleil, Haiti’s largest slum on the outskirts of the wrecked capital Port-au-Prince. They faced off again on Monday in the National Stadium as part of a low-key yet poignant commemoration of the disaster that killed around a quarter of a million people. “Everything can’t get fixed after the earthquake but life goes on,” said Mackendy Francois, whose friends used a hacksaw to cut off his left leg below the knee when they freed him from the rubble of a shirt factory a year ago. Thousands of people lost limbs in the earthquake, which left more than 1 million Haitians homeless and living in misery in the already poor, calamity-prone Caribbean nation. “Life didn’t end when I lost a leg,” Francois, 23, told Reuters. He said he felt proud to represent his team against opposing side Zaryen, named after the Haitian Creole term for a tarantula because of the way the hardy spider keeps on going even after it loses a leg. The players got treatment, athletic training and prosthetic limbs thanks to a joint effort by Miami’s Project Medishare and the Knights of Columbus, which committed more than $1 million to the prosthetics and therapy program. More than 100 young quake victims have been fitted with limbs in the program so far and hundreds more will begin treatment in the coming weeks and months, Knights of Columbus Senior Vice President Patrick Korten told Reuters in an email. The soccer teams include some players disabled by birth defects and amputees from accidents unrelated to the quake. Despite the uplifting example of the amputee players, initial hopes that a new, more successful Haiti could somehow rise from the rubble with international help are becoming clouded by a sense of pessimism and despair. Even before the quake, about 70 percent of the 10 million people in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere’s poorest state, lived on less than $2 a day. Conditions for many now seem worse. Zaryen midfielder Bernard Noubert, who lost both his parents in the quake in the same building where he lost a leg, said soccer has helped keep him going. “It’s the best distraction for me to lighten my heart,” he said. LOW-PROFILE COMMEMORATION   Despite billions of dollars in pledged aid and a generous outpouring of world solidarity for Haiti after the quake, the anniversary promises little in the way of celebration. That may be due to a steady drumbeat of criticism from many quarters about how little has been achieved so far in trying to rebuild the capital city. Major streets in Port-au-Prince have been mostly cleared of rubble and tent cities that once held more than 1.3 million people made homeless by the quake have slowly started to thin out. But debris still covers vast tracts of the capital and bodies are still being pulled from collapsed buildings. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, the U.N. special envoy to Haiti who heads a reconstruction commission with outgoing Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, has also faced criticism over the lack of tangible results. Clinton is expected back in Port-au-Prince this week and is likely to call for patience in the grueling rebuilding task. Commemoration events this week include a ceremony on Tuesday marking the reopening of Port-au-Prince’s restored Iron Market, a cultural and architectural landmark in the city’s downtown area. Built by the French in the late 19th Century, the market with its ornate clock tower was badly damaged in the quake after a fire in 2008. Its restoration was funded by Irish-owned telecoms company Digicel, Haiti’s largest private investor. But such schemes are of little interest to Anise Sainee, a 54-year-old grandmother who lives with her husband and 11 children and grandchildren in a tent in a crowded camp in front of the wrecked presidential palace. She holds little hopes for a better future. “I can only count on God,” she said. A strong stench drifted from nearby latrines and from a sewer in front of Sainee’s tent, with its corrugated tin roof and dirty plastic sheeting stamped with the words “U.S. Aid from the American People.”   “I’ve seen no government here. There is no government,” Sainee said. “I’ve seen no progress either. It seems like the situation just gets worse.”   Nine months after the quake, a cholera epidemic hit Haiti and has since killed more than 3,600 people. Even the November 28 presidential and legislative elections failed to give greater credibility to the government, with the outcome of the vote mired in uncertainty after widespread fraud allegations and sporadic street violence. Screeds of Creole graffiti on Port-au-Prince’s walls chronicle Haiti’s chaotic politics. One reads “Aba Okipasyon (Down With the Occupation)” but it is not clear if it refers to the U.N. peacekeeping force in Haiti, the reconstruction commission co-chaired by Clinton or the army of foreigners involved in Haiti’s reconstruction. Given this instability, it is not surprising that some Haitians hark back with nostalgia to the rule of Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier, who from 1971 continued the rule of his late despotic father Francois “Papa Doc” Duvalier. Sainee’s 62-year-old husband, Fedor Cine, lost his job as a street sweeper four years ago and is one of those who believes things were better in the Duvalier era. “He was a real president,” Cine said of Jean-Claude Duvalier, who lives in France after being ousted by a popular uprising in 1986 — a rebellion that began Haiti’s still ongoing experiment with democracy.",true,Health News

He is seeking more than $15,000 in damages.",Brooke Binkowski,"In December 2015, Daniel Frederick Rushing was arrested when he was leaving a 7-Eleven in Orlando, Florida. That particular convenience store is apparently a locus of illegal activity, and since Rushing had been in and out of it a few times that day, police were suspicious. They pulled him over, found a few flakes of a “rock like substance” that looked suspicious on his floorboard, and — according to the police report — arrested him for possession of methamphetamine after a field test: A silver 4-door Chevy pulled into the 7-11 and parked. A white male, later identified as Daniel Frederick Rushing entered the 7-11 for a very brief moment and then exited the store without making a purchase. Rushing drove away and then returned a few minutes later with a black female employee of the 7-11. Rushing went back into the store and then left with the female a short time later. As Rushing was leaving the parking lot of the 7-11, he made no attempt to stop before entering the roadway to travel East on Colonial Drive (in violation of Florida state statute). Rushing then traveling north onto Parramore Avenue where the speed limit was 30 miles per hour. I paced Rushing at 42 miles per hour (with my certified calibrated speedometer) in the 30 mile per hour zone. For those two infractions I conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle at Parramore and Robinson. When I made contact with Rushing I asked him for his driver license. When Rushing opened his wallet I observed a concealed weapons permit. I asked Rushing if he was armed and he stated that he was. For my safety, I asked Rushing to step out of the vehicle. When Rushing exited the vehicle, I observed in plain view a rock like substance on the floor board where his feet were. I recognized, through my eleven years of training and experience as a law enforcement officer, the substance to be some sort of narcotic. I removed the firearm (a loaded revolver) from Rushing and placed it in my vehicle for my safety. Additionally, I asked Rushing if he had anything illegal in his vehicle and he stated no. I asked Rushing if I could search his vehicle and he stated yes. Officer Vance (17448) and Officer Rolle (18874) arrived to assist me with the traffic stop. I retrieved the substance that I initially saw on the floor board and two other small pieces from the floor board of the driver side. Officer Vance found an additional piece of the same substance in between the driver seat and the door area. I field tested the substance and I received a positive indication for the presence of amphetamines. I conducted a separate test on the substance and received another positive indication for amphetamines. I provided Rushing his rights per Miranda. Rushing stated that he has never done any drugs in his life and he has no idea how the substance got in his vehicle. Rushing stated that the substance is sugar from a Krispy Kreme donut that he ate. Rushing was placed under arrest and charged with possession of amphetamine with a weapon. The “rock-like substance,” as it turned out, really was glaze from the Krispy Kreme donut that Rushing had been eating as he was driving one friend to the hospital for a chemotherapy appointment, before picking up another friend who needed a ride home. Rushing was jailed for ten hours. “It was incredible,” he told reporters:  It feels scary when you haven’t done anything wrong and get arrested. … It’s just a terrible feeling. Several weeks after Rushing’s arrest, the lab reports came back showing no trace of methamphetamines or any other types of illegal substances. He has now hired a lawyer, and plans to sue the city because he was arrested for no reason at all. (Orlando police said that the arrest was lawful.) It’s not the first time field tests have mistaken sugary substances for methamphetamines or crack cocaine. In July 2016, investigative journalist outfit ProPublica found that up to half of the positive results from the $2 drug kits Florida police use for field testing are later invalidated: In one notable Florida episode, Hillsborough County sheriff’s deputies produced 15 false positives for methamphetamine in the first seven months of 2014. When we examined the department’s records, they showed that officers, faced with somewhat ambiguous directions on the pouches, had simply misunderstood which colors indicated a positive result. According to a 2015 story published by The Marshall Project, a reporting initiative about the United States criminal justice system, the tests yield false positives at least five percent of the time: Sage has been mistaken for marijuana; motor oil for heroin; jolly ranchers for meth; and breath mints for crack. In February, a Minnesota man spent months in jail after his vitamin powder tested positive for amphetamines. Soon after the arrest in Tampa, a Hillsborough police lieutenant conducted his own experiment on the NARK II tests, which cost between $15 and $20 for a box of ten. He found that just opening the test bag to the air produced the same shade of purple as exposure to methamphetamine, according to an internal memo. In February, the Hillsborough sheriff’s department announced it had switched to a different field test, made by the same company, which tests for a wider variety of illegal drugs. A spokeswoman for the sheriff’s department declined interview requests. In Austin, Texas, the field tests law enforcement was using yielded so many false positives that they stopped relying on field tests for drug-related indictments in 2013, instead returning to far slower lab test results for suspected drug offenses. No central agency regulates what drug tests are used in police departments, and there are no centralized or comprehensive records about their use.",true,"Crime, drug testing, false positives, florida"

REUTERS/Keith Bedford “I’m not losing nothing,” Honica Brittman said this week, sitting in a blue and white hospital gown before surgery in which she would give, for free, the initial kidney in a chain of five kidney transplants at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center. “To actually help somebody live a little bit, a lot longer, that’s an awesome thing,” she said. Brittman, who decided to be part of the swap after learning she could not donate to a family friend because of incompatibility, represents what experts say is a critical and growing number of “altruistic” or “non-directed” donors, people willing to donate to anyone in need as long as their blood type, antigens and other factors are compatible. The health dangers for kidney donors is believed to be low. The risk of death from the surgery is 1 in 1,700, according to the National Kidney Foundation, and life expectancy is said to be unchanged with one kidney. High blood pressure is a possible side effect, and critics point out there is no systemic collection of national data on the risks associated with living kidney donations. Experts say donors such as Brittman are key to helping the over 90,000 people awaiting a kidney transplant in the United States, according to the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. As in Brittman’s case, donors can enable a chain of kidney exchanges that increases the number of people who can benefit from live kidney transplants, which typically last longer than cadaver kidneys. The series of operation on Wednesday and Thursday, which required 10 separate surgical teams and weeks of coordination, was made up of a series of swaps within a group of men and women between the ages of 23 and 68 and with compatible blood types, all motivated by a mix of compassion and commitment to their loved ones. The chain started with Brittman, who donated a kidney to a 39-year-old television producer whose fiancée and partner of more than 10 years donated to a businessman from upstate New York. In turn, the businessman’s son, a college-age student who felt that for being healthy and the youngest of four sons, he should step up on behalf of his father and donate one of his kidneys to another young man, a 23-year-old originally from Haiti. His father then donated to a retired teacher from New Jersey. The operations took place in neighboring rooms with doctors simply walking from one room to another to deliver the small, plump vital organ from the donor to the recipient. The chain that Brittman made possible ended on Thursday when a woman, the wife of the retired teacher, donated her kidney to another woman who had been waiting four years for a transplant. “All this stems from the fact that this young woman ... wanted to donate a kidney purely altruistically without knowing any of the recipients,” said Lloyd Ratner, a surgeon and director of renal and pancreatic transplantation at the hospital. Brittman, by giving the first kidney, prevented any pair in the chain from having to donate a kidney before receiving one. While there is no conclusive national data on the number of donors like Brittman, experts estimate they have increased to between 100 and 200 a year, up from just dozens a few years ago. “After every chain that gets some publicity, there’s a flood of potential donors contacting kidney exchange networks and individual transplant centers,” Alvin Roth, an economics professor at the Harvard Business School said. The chain was also made possible by the decision of another pair in the group to be part of it. Adam Abernathy, the television producer, and his fiancée Dave Ferguson, 43, could have done a simple transplant between them because Ferguson’s blood type made him a universal donor. But they decided to be part of a chain when it was proposed by the hospital that Ferguson donate his kidney to a man whose blood type had made him a harder match for a donor, A. Jamal, the businessman and father of four. “We realized if we were in somebody else’s shoes, we’d want someone to do the same,” Ferguson said. Most of the group said they plan to meet their donors after recovering from the operation. “I can’t wait to meet them,” Brittman said.",true,Health News

In the video, Alexa’s computer-generated voice responds: ""According to Event 201, the government planned this event, created the virus and had a simulation of how the countries would react. This simulation occurred October 18, 2019. The government released the virus among the population and has lost control of the outbreak."" The spread of misinformation about the coronavirus on TikTok and through Amazon Alexa have recently been reported by outlets such as WUSA9’s VERIFY team and Vox. Let’s take a closer look. There was an Event 201, involving a simulated viral pandemic. And it did take place on Oct. 18, 2019, at a hotel in New York. But no actual virus was created or released. During the event, officials from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and 15 global business, government and public health leaders held a 3.5 hour simulation to view the potential effects of an infectious pandemic. The exercise consisted of pre-recorded news broadcasts, live ""staff"" briefings, and moderated discussions on specific topics, the organizers said. The purpose of the simulation was to examine how industries, governments and public health leaders might have to join forces to combat a global health crisis. It was inspired by research published by the World Economic Forum, an international foundation that studies the intersection of business, politics and academics and their impacts on policy. The pandemic in the fictionalized scenario was caused by a coronavirus, of which there are many types. The study found that a pandemic could cause an average annual economic loss of 0.7% of global gross domestic product, or about $570 billion. The businesses and political leaders involved in the simulation were tasked with working together to create viable solutions to the theoretical pandemic. The participants’ conclusion was that ""the next severe pandemic will not only cause great illness and loss of life but could also trigger major cascading economic and societal consequences that could contribute greatly to global impact and suffering."" Now that the world is grappling with an actual coronavirus pandemic, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has released a statement reaffirming that the simulation did not predict the current outbreak, but rather was an exercise to examine what would need to happen if one did occur. ""For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction,"" the center said. ""Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic."" Why did the question posed to Alexa bring up Event 201? That only happens in the TikTok video. We asked Alexa directly, and it brought up a different response. Alexa said, ""According to the World Health Organization, the exact cause of the current outbreak of COVID-19 is still under investigation.

The company said that any news Alexa is providing to customers about COVID-19 is from official government sources. The company suggested a couple of explanations why Alexa might have responded the way it did in the video. One possibility is that a customer set a specific response for Alexa. Responses can be recorded and scheduled, like a daily reminder service. This response would play only on that customer’s device, not the system at large. Another possibility involves Alexa Skill Blueprints, which offer templates for trivia games, birthday cards, and flashcards.

Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter’s 2017 lawsuit accuses Purdue, Johnson & Johnson & Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd of engaging in deceptive marketing that downplayed the risks of addiction associated with opioid pain drugs while overstating their benefits. The companies deny wrongdoing. They had sought to delay the May 28 trial to Sept. 16, citing the need to review records the state belatedly turned over that could be critical to their defense. The state is seeking over $20 billion in damages. The trial delay bid came as Purdue, owned by members of the wealthy Sackler family, was exploring filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to address potential liabilities stemming from the lawsuits, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Purdue did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. After the trial judge declined on March 8 to delay the trial, Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue denied that his ruling would have any affect on whether it files for bankruptcy. “We appreciate the quick action taken by the court and for not rewarding the defendants with more time for a problem of their own making,” Hunter said in a statement. J&J and Teva did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Opioids, including prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The epidemic has prompted lawsuits by state and local governments accusing Purdue and other drugmakers of contributing to the crisis. More than 1,600 lawsuits have been consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio, who has pushed for a settlement ahead of the trial before him in October.

The former mayor of New York City during 9/11 was widely lampooned for suggesting that terrorist attacks on U.S. soil were unique to Barack Obama’s presidency. But many media reports left out the beginning of his speech, when he talked at length about 9/11. He recounted how it was the ""worst foreign attack in our history since the War of 1812"" and how Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, visited ""Ground Zero when we were in desperate need of help."" Still, Giuliani seemed to throw everything he had just said out the window: ""By the way, under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States. They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office."" Back in 2010, Giuliani made a similar gaffe when he claimed, ""We had no domestic attacks under (President George W.) Bush."" He later apologized for misspeaking and not adding the words, ""since Sept. 11."" Giuliani apparently made the same mistake again, telling the New York Daily News that he was just using ""abbreviated language."" But even barring 9/11, Giuliani is omitting several successful attacks on U.S. soil. Some are undoubtedly jihad-linked while the connection to ""radical Islamic extremism"" is murkier in others. The New America Foundation, for example, compiles a comprehensive list of terrorist plots, but its definition of ""violent jihadist attacks"" does not necessarily match up with law enforcement classification. That’s because strict definitions like ""hate crime"" or ""terrorist attack"" may be useful for prosecuting cases, but they may cloud the public’s understanding of what the attack was and what motivated the crimes — ""questions to which answers are rarely linear or packaged into a neat explanation,"" said Albert Ford, a research assistant at New America. That being said, let’s go through successful attacks on U.S. soil in which ideology played some role. 2002 Los Angeles Airport shooting On July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two and injuring four. Hadayet, a 41-year-old Egyptian national, died after being shot by an airport security guard. Prior to his immigration to the United States, Egyptian authorities accused him of belonging to the terrorist organization, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (though he denied this charge). The FBI concluded that Hadayet’s killing spree was a terrorist act, but he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine. 2002 Beltway snipers In October 2002, John Allen Muhammad and his accomplice, 17-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo, randomly gunned down 10 people in Washington. They were arrested by police and SWAT officers on Oct. 24. The snipers’ motives were myriad. Malvo drew sketches depicting his acts as jihad and testified that Muhammad, a member of the Nation of Islam, lectured him on the religion. He also said Muhammad wanted to start a revolution over ""the continued oppression of black people."" A Virginia court found Muhammad guilty of engaging in an act of terrorism, and the incident is listed as a major terrorism case on the FBI’s website. Muhammad was executed in 2009 and Malvo is currently serving a life sentence. 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting On July 28, 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. A witness told the Associated Press that Haq declared himself ""a Muslim American, angry at Israel"" before opening fire. FBI officials said he was not acting part of a terrorist group, but ""acting out some kind of antagonism toward this particular organization."" The attack was ultimately classified as a hate crime by the county prosecutor. In 2014, however, the City of Seattle included the shooting as an example of an incident that fits ""into the terrorist mold"" while the New America Foundation lists it as a ""violent jihadist attack,"" because Haq claimed to be motivated by opposition to U.S. actions. 2006 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill attack In March 2006, UNC graduate Mohammad Reza Taheri-azar drove an SUV onto campus, injuring nine pedestrians. He turned himself in following the attack and sent several letters to UNC’s student newspaper from jail declaring his intentions to exact revenge for Muslims. ""I was aiming to follow in the footsteps of one of my role models, Mohammad Atta, one of the 9/11/01 hijackers, who obtained a doctorate degree,"" he wrote in one letter. UNC students were divided over whether Taheri-azar’s actions constituted an act of terror. The FBI declined to comment on whether it was investigating links to terrorism, the New York Times reported in 2006. Terrorist attacks that were unsuccessful or with unknown motives Two other infamous attacks don’t exactly fit Giuliani’s criteria, but are worth noting. The 2001 anthrax scare, which occurred shortly after 9/11, is the worst biological attack in U.S. history and a major terrorism case, according to the FBI. Five Americans were killed and another 17 were injured during the attacks. In 2008, the FBI was about to bring charges against Dr. Bruce Ivins, but the microbiologist committed suicide before they were filed. The 2001 shoe bomber, admitted al-Qaida member Richard Reid, attempted to light explosives on an American Airlines flight before he was subdued. In addition to these attacks, the New America Foundation has documented a handful of thwarted terrorist plots before Obama’s presidency. Our ruling Moments after mentioning 9/11, Giuliani said, ""Under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States."" Since then, there have been four successful plots on U.S. soil that were declared by the FBI to be terrorist attacks or whose perpetrators claimed to be motivated by ideology or anti-U.S. sentiments. Reasonable people can disagree over the definition of jihad-inspired terrorism, but Giuliani is taking things too far by omitting all of them.

A genuine news report about his death can be read here. The following report concerns a death hoax that circulated shortly after Hayden was hospitalized but well before he actually passed way. On 19 May 2017, the web site Reports-TV.com published a tasteless fake news article that included the claim that motorcycle race champion Nicky Hayden had passed away after a cycling incident in Italy: Former MotoGP [a motorcycle race] champion Nicky Hayden who was in an “extremely critical” condition has died, family announces in a statement. According to the statement the family was by his side after suffering “serious cerebral damage” in a cycling accident on Wednesday until his death this morning. Nicky Hayden did in fact suffer serious injuries while cycling in Italy. However, his family did not release a statement on 19 May 2017 informing the public that the motorcycle racer had passed away. In fact, Earl Hayden, Nicky’s father, told Roadracing World that rumor was not true and this article was fake news: I spoke to Earl this morning, and adding to the family’s pain has been a cascade of FAKE NEWS posted all over the internet, including by alleged professional news organizations that should know better. Earl told me the following: The family HAS NOT issued a statement that Nicky is dead. Nicky IS NOT dead, although he is on life support. Nicky was riding his bicycle alone, NOT in a group of 14 riders. Doctors DID NOT perform surgery on Nicky. Nicky WAS NEVER in an induced coma. The Red Bull Honda World Superbike Team, of which Hayden is a member, released a statement on 18 May 2017 reporting that Hayden had been involved in a serious accident while cycling near Rimini, Italy. Red Bull Honda World Superbike Team rider Nicky Hayden was involved in an incident while cycling near Rimini, Italy yesterday afternoon (Wednesday, 17th May) Following the incident, Nicky was treated on site by medical staff and then taken by ambulance to a hospital near Rimini for immediate treatment. Once Nicky’s condition was stabilised, he was transferred to Maurizio Bufalini Hospital in Cesena and remains in the hospital’s intensive care unit. The team issued another statement the following day reporting that Hayden’s condition had not changed: The following statement regarding Nicky Hayden’s current condition has been released today, 19 May 2017, at 19:45 local time (GMT +2), by the Maurizio Bufalini Hospital in Cesena (Italy). “The clinical picture of Nicky Hayden remains unchanged.

1011,9169,Magnetic brain stimulation causes weight loss by making gut bacteria healthier,"April 6, 2017","The focus of this news release from The Endocrine Society is on research examining the impact of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) — a non-invasive treatment that can stimulate different regions of the brain — on weight loss, hormones and signaling molecules that can affect metabolism and appetite, and composition of the gut microbiome in 14 obese human subjects living in Italy. Microbiome refers to the community of microorganisms living in and on our bodies, most of which are within the gut, and their genetic makeup. The results indicated that volunteers who underwent dTMS lost more weight and fat mass than those who had a sham procedure and that changes were seen in the microbiome profile in individuals who’d had dTMS. The release didn’t discuss any changes in the sham group, and there was no discussion of where these results fit within the total body of evidence in this area of research. Most importantly, the release takes significant liberties by stating that dTMS can directly impact microbes living in the gut, without considering the impact that weight loss and lifestyle changes have on microbial composition. Employing a more cautious interpretation of the results, and including a discussion of costs, risks, and comparisons to other weight loss treatments would have significantly improved the release. Researchers and clinicians work relentlessly every day to find treatments for obesity and its chronic health consequences, and yet, new, safe and effective techniques are few and far between. It’s well known that obesity treatment and management are critical concerns in the United States and abroad. Any new technique that might influence weight loss, appetite, or the gut microbiome is exciting to consider, given that lifestyle changes and prescription weight loss drugs often have limited long-term impacts. However, this news release overstates and oversimplifies the results of the study without fully addressing the complex interplay between weight loss, metabolic hormones and neurotransmitters (the brain’s chemical messengers), and the microbes living in our gut. Change in one of these components typically doesn’t proceed without the others, and the mechanisms are extremely intricate and multifaceted. This release seems to leap from Point A to Point C in a conclusion that does not show appropriate and cautious interpretation of the results of this very small study.","Allison Dostal, PhD, RD,Kathleen Fairfield, MD, DrPH,Kathlyn Stone","Cost of dTMS is not mentioned in this release. After doing a bit of independent information gathering, it seems that even though dTMS may be more cost-effective than other more invasive neurostimulation techniques, each session can cost a patient roughly $400-$500, according to PyschologyToday. Individuals in this study underwent 15 sessions each, which amounts to $6000 to $7500 for five weeks of therapy. We don’t know the long-term effects of dTMS on weight loss, nor do we know if, or – more likely – how often these sessions would need to be repeated, but it’s easy to see the price for an individual mounting quickly. The release doesn’t mention insurance coverage but costs for this type of therapy are likely to be out-of-pocket. One of the least straightforward ways to present research results is by stating changes in percentages rather than absolute differences between groups — and this release does exactly that. The release states, “After five weeks of treatment, subjects receiving dTMS lost more than 3 percent of their body weight and more than 4 percent of their fat — significantly more than controls did.” And yet, the release doesn’t report actual body weight or body fat data, leaving readers out in the cold as to what a 3 or 4% change in weight or fat loss really means. This is unintentionally misleading for people trying to assess the value of the treatment. Current guidelines for treating obesity recommend a 5 to 10 percent weight loss within one year for benefits to be clinically meaningful, and it’s uncertain if participants would achieve this goal, given the short time frame of the study. Neither the release or the abstract it’s based on addressed whether volunteers in the sham group (those who didn’t receive dTMS therapy) also lose weight or fat mass. Without this comparison, it’s difficult to understand the impact of dTMS itself or if the placebo effect played a role in these results. Specific risks are not discussed, though it’s mentioned that dTMS is currently approved in the U.S. for treating major depression and is being studied in other countries for treating neuropsychiatric disorders. Unlike deep brain stimulation, this technique does not require an operation or implantation of electrodes, so we can deduce that the potential harms are lower than other neurostimulation procedures. Nevertheless, a brief mention of harms would give readers a sense of the risk-benefit balance should dTMS rise in popularity and availability in the coming years. The release tells us that this research builds upon previous findings demonstrating that dTMS reduced food cravings and induced weight loss in obese individuals. That conclusion is also supported by the results of the current study, though we can’t gloss over the fact that the study only had 14 participants total — just 7 of whom received dTMS. The release claims that dTMS “helps obese people lose weight, partly by changing the composition of their intestinal bacteria.” But based on the study design of this research, there simply isn’t a way to determine if the changes in gut microbes were due to changes in weight, food intake, physical activity, hormonal or metabolic shifts, or if they were directly due to dTMS. The release suggests that dTMS can influence pituitary hormones and neurotransmitters, which are known to affect appetite and certain microbiota, respectively, but very little is known in this area of research and it would be wise to tread with caution through this conclusion. The release doesn’t engage in disease mongering. Obesity is an increasing problem on both the individual and population-level scales. The release provides some context about why new obesity treatments are needed, as well as the possible role gut microbes might play in weight management. No funding sources or conflicts of interest are described in the news release. While many strategies for weight loss are well known to the general public, none are mentioned in this release. It would be beneficial for readers to be able to compare the weight loss and metabolic changes in subjects who underwent dTMS to the results typically seen through changes in diet and physical activity, FDA-approved weight loss medications, or bariatric surgery, all of which are widely accepted treatments for obesity. The release does not discuss the availability of this treatment and the treatment does not appear to be available for obesity at this time. Since dTMS is only approved in the U.S. for treatment of depression, it’s unlikely that it would be available to people without a formal diagnosis of depression. The news release confirms that dTMS has been around for a while and is used to treat other conditions, but highlights that using the procedure to treat obesity is a new area of exploration. Though the release does take liberties in stating the conclusion of the study, it stays away from sensational language about the dTMS and its potential role in weight loss and microbial changes.",false,"magnetic brain stimulation,obesity,The Endocrine Society"
1012,30528,"Before his death, physicist Stephen Hawking declared his Christian faith after a visit with Pope Francis.","March 19, 2018","This Facebook post is just another in a litany of fabricated claims about famous non-believers. The source is a Facebook page associated with the disreputable web site FrancisMary.org, which appears to have no formal affiliation with the Catholic church and routinely posts clickbait articles touting videos of Jesus Christ appearing in the flesh during a church service, or as an “angel on a white horse fighting in Israel.”",Dan MacGuill,"The renowned physicist Stephen Hawking died in March 2018 at the age of 76, prompting a wave of tributes from the world of science, as well as reflections on his inspirational life story. On 14 March 2018, the “Catholics Online” Facebook page posted a photograph of Hawking meeting Pope Francis alongside a fabricated claim: Before he died, Stiph [sic] Hawkins [sic] who did not believe in God requested to visit the Vatican. “Now l believe” was the only statement he made after the Holy Father blessed him. Hawking was a longstanding and prominent atheist who often wrote and spoke about the origins of the universe and his views on the notion of a divine Creator (or rather, a lack thereof). As the Washington Post documented after his death, Hawking told the Guardian in 2011 that he did not believe in an afterlife or heaven: I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark. In 2010, he told ABC News: “One can’t prove that God doesn’t exist, but science makes God unnecessary.”  There is no evidence that Hawking deviated from those lifelong views before his death, and he did not make any declaration of faith after a meeting with Pope Francis.The photograph in the Facebook post shows Hawking and Francis together at the Vatican in November 2016, the last time the two men met. Contrary to the claim, Hawking did not request a private visit with the pontiff; rather, he travelled to Rome for a scheduled meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. Hawking was a valued member of the academy, having been appointed to it by Pope Paul VI in 1968. The Pontifical Academy of Sciences listed has among its aims “fostering interaction between faith and reason and encouraging dialogue between science and spiritual, cultural, philosophical and religious values.” After his death, the academy honored Hawking, tweeting a series of photographs of the physicist meeting Popes Paul VI, John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis. il beato Paolo VI che si inginocchia per consegnare la medaglia di Pio XI e Hawking che ringrazia al Papa per la decorazione pic.twitter.com/zVICFDlkaE — Casina Pio IV (@CasinaPioIV) March 15, 2018  However, notwithstanding his decades-long commitment to fostering dialogue between science and faith, Hawking remained an unbeliever himself. Hawking’s phony deathbed conversion is one in a long series of similar hoaxes of opportunity. For example, after the 2011 death of the writer Christopher Hitchens — an outspoken atheist and critic of organized religion — American evangelical Christian writer Larry Alex Taunton published a controversial book in which he claimed Hitchens had reevaluated his religious faith while he was dying of esophageal cancer. The book was widely dismissed and fiercely criticized by friends of Hitchens. Before that, there were debunked eleventh-hour “conversions” to Christianity by Charles Darwin, the father of the theory of evolution, and astronomer Carl Sagan.",false,"Politics, pope francis"
1014,33352,"White House adviser Valerie Jarrett once said she seeks ""to help change America to be a more Islamic country.","February 10, 2015","Moreover, the wording of the meme in its commonly reproduced form was too stilted to be believable as the utterance of a fluent English speaker (e.g., “I am an Iranian by birth and of [sic] my Islamic faith”). Finally, no news article or document associated with Stanford University records Jarrett as having made this statement back in 1977; and if there were any credible evidence Jarrett had ever said anything remotely like this, it would have been a well-covered news story since shortly after the 2008 presidential election and not a obscure meme that didn’t pop up until several years later.",David Mikkelson,"Valerie Jarrett was offered a role as a White House Senior Advisor at the very beginning of the Obama administration in January 2009 and held the position of Senior Advisor to the President of the United States. President Obama said he consulted Jarrett on every major decision, and the New Republic‘s Noam Scheiber reported thus of her influence with the White House: “Her role since she has been at the White House is one of the broadest and most expansive roles that I think has ever existed in the West Wing,” says Anita Dunn, Obama’s former communications director. Broader, even, than the role of running the West Wing. This summer, the call to send Attorney General Eric Holder on a risky visit to Ferguson, Missouri, was made by exactly three people: Holder himself, the president, and Jarrett, who were vacationing together on Martha’s Vineyard. When I asked Holder if Denis McDonough, the chief of staff, was part of the conversation, he thought for a moment and said, “He was not there.” Jarrett holds a key vote on Cabinet picks (she opposed Larry Summers at Treasury and was among the first Obama aides to come around on Hillary Clinton at State) and has an outsize say on ambassadorships and judgeships. She helps determine who gets invited to the First Lady’s Box for the State of the Union, who attends state dinners and bill-signing ceremonies, and who sits where at any of the above The level of influence Jarrett held with the Obama administration prompted many detractors to complain she wielded too much control over the President and decisions about who should have access to him, and one expression that detraction commonly took was the assertion that Jarrett was a foreign-born Islamic “mole” who was pushing for (or furthering) a Muslim agenda through the executive branch. One quote attributed to Jarrett is a typical example, holding that while she was an undergraduate psychology student at Stanford University in 1977, she proclaimed herself to be an Iranian who sought “to help change America to be a more Islamic country” and she felt “like it is going well in the transition of using freedom of religion in America against itself”:  Contrary to common rumor, however, neither Jarrett nor her parents are Iranian, nor (as far as we can tell) are any of them Muslim. Jarrett’s parents, James E. Bowman and Barbara Taylor Bowman, were both American-born U.S. citizens from Washington, D.C. and Chicago, respectively; the couple merely lived in Iran for about six years in the late 1950s and early 1960s while James served as chair of pathology at Nemazee Hospital in Shiraz as part of a program that sent American physicians to work in developing countries. Valerie was born in Shiraz during the Bowmans’ sojourn in Iran; she returned to the U.S. with her parents in 1962 (when she was five years old), whereupon she attended prep school in Massachusetts, graduated with a B.A. in psychology from Stanford University in 1978, and earned a J.D. from the University of Michigan Law School in 1981 before returning to Chicago to begin her working career. We’ve found no evidence Valerie Jarrett is (or ever was) Muslim, her only apparent connection to that religion being the incidental one that she temporarily lived in a predominantly Muslim country with her American parents for the first few years of her life. The quote to attributed “Valerie Jarrett, Stanford University, 1977” about her “seek[ing] to help change America to be a more Islamic country” is an unfounded one that has no source other than recent repetition (primarily on right-wing web sites and blogs). It’s also an anachronism, as “Valerie Jarrett” didn’t exist in 1977: she was born Valerie Bowman and didn’t take the latter surname until she married William Jarrett in 1983.",false,"Politics Quotes, islam, muslim, valerie jarrett"
1019,10543,Blood test that could predict arthritis risk,"December 21, 2015","This release from the University of Oxford describes a new blood test that researchers there developed after zeroing in on the protein that collects in the joints of people with rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of the protein can predict the advance of rheumatoid arthritis many years before arthritis symptoms develop, according to the research findings published in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases. Among some of the 2,000 individuals who were part of the study, the protein, called tenascin-C, was found as many as 16 years before disease symptoms appeared. The release does a good job describing the science behind the test but may leave readers wondering, “What’s next?” That’s because we aren’t told when and where the test will be available and there’s no mention of early treatment strategies — what the options are, what they entail, how long it lasts and what it might cost. Most doctors screen for rheumatoid arthritis among patients presenting with joint symptoms. Tests to diagnose RA aren’t perfect but have gotten better over time. This news release highlights a new test that may be able to identify patients who have not yet been diagnosed. As such, it would be predicting future RA in patients who do not yet have symptoms or other findings such as arthritis changes on x-rays. Identifying patients with so-called “pre-RA” might appear to be a good thing, but it may not be as simple as implied in this news release. First, it is one thing to retrospectively examine whether blood samples performed years earlier can identify people we’ve already classified. The next logical step would be to prospectively see if we can take patients who don’t have any symptoms and use the test to say “positive or negative” and then wait to see if the test correctly predicts a future diagnosis. This is complicated by the need to say who should we use the test on. Everyone? Someone who may be at risk for other reasons? It isn’t clear and the news release doesn’t help us. Second, since no test is perfect and there inevitably will be false-positives, what does it mean to label someone as being likely to develop future RA if in fact they won’t? Third, even if the test is correct, it isn’t clear what to do with the results. Should we start treating these patients with medications to prevent future symptoms? If the treatments had no side effects, one could argue to do so. But we know that the treatments for RA all have side effects, some quite serious. For those with debilitating symptoms, the risks of such medications may be justified. But for someone who has no such symptoms, it isn’t as clear. One would like to see studies saying that use of this test result leads to better outcomes. No such data exists. Finally, there is no effort to state what would be the potential costs of using such a test in routine practice. One would not only need to consider the cost of the test itself, but also the downstream costs associated with treatment and the potential savings in terms of RA complications avoided.","Kathlyn Stone,Steven J. Atlas, MD, MPH,Kevin Lomangino","The release doesn’t provide discussion of what the cost of the blood test might be. If the test is promising enough to issue a news release about it, readers should be given some idea of the cost. A related test called the CCP assay, which detects certain peptides that also predict future RA, is already in use and would make a good comparison. Moreover, there would not only be the cost for this test, but also the downstream costs of earlier treatment (and potential benefits). In general, the potential benefits in terms of cost savings are usually offset by higher costs associated with treatment for a longer duration of time (earlier diagnosis = earlier “longer” treatment). The release asserts that the key benefit of the test for tenascin-C protein is early detection of RA that can be used to initiate early treatment. After looking at results from 2,000 patient volunteers, the lead researcher was quoted saying the test “could diagnose RA in about 50% of cases” and that the test was 98% accurate in ruling out RA. It isn’t clear from the release if all 2,000 patients started out healthy and half went on to develop RA, or if the test accurately detected the RA precursor protein in only half the patients that went on to develop RA. Overall, the release provides insufficient information to quantify the benefits. Accuracy is a reflection of both sensitivity (diagnosing the condition when it really exists) and specificity (not diagnosing the condition when it doesn’t exist). The very high accuracy implies the test is both sensitive and specific. However, this may be misleading depending on the nature of the population studied. If the population includes patients with established rheumatoid arthritis it may make the test look better than studying a population of individuals who don’t have the condition or may have a different condition. The release briefly notes that the test carries a very low rate of false positives. However, the harms from screening tests are well-known. A false positive can result in additional tests, unnecessary treatment, anxiety and financial strains. A major concern is using the test in asymptomatic individuals who may be at risk for future development of symptoms due to rheumatoid arthritis. If the test isn’t 100% specific, it means we’re telling some patients who are otherwise fine that they’re going to develop something bad in the future – when in fact they won’t. Oops! Second, it isn’t clear that treating such asymptomatic patients may benefit them long-term. Remember the drugs for rheumatoid arthritis all have side effects – some of which can be quite serious. These potential harms are not mentioned at all. The research is a statistical analysis of data from four separately conducted studies of patients in four different geographic locations. The study cohorts varied which could affect accuracy of the findings. One group included 20 British RA patients and 20 healthy controls; one included 101 pre-RA cases and 326 matched controls compiled from four Southern European cohorts; a Swedish study involving 1985 RA patients and 160 health controls; and 287 RA patients and 330 control patients with osteoarthritis (OA) in the United States. The key missing point is that these are all retrospective cohorts. What one would like to see is a prospective cohort where you apply the test and classify the patient as positive or negative and then see what happens. Even before that, one would like information on the cut-points used in this study to define what is positive or not. Understanding whether there is a clear point where the test is positive or not would be useful information. In practice, that cut point is usually never 100% obvious. One could argue that this study and news release are pushing for the creation of a new disease – called “pre-rheumatoid arthritis.” But the value of classifying people with such a condition is not established, and the release doesn’t explore any of the downsides of such an approach. Expanding the boundaries of disease without sufficient evidence that this is justified constitutes disease-mongering. So we’ll flag the release here. There’s no mention of the funders in the release. According to the published study, funding was provided by the Arthritis Research UK, the Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research and BT CURE. In addition, it was disclosed that “data in this manuscript are the subject of a patent filing” and that the lead investigator sits on the board of and is a consultant to Nascient. The release provides some information about the cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) test, the standard test used, and states that the new blood test appears to be more accurate and reliable in comparison. The true alternative is actually to wait until symptoms develop. As noted above under “Cost,” if the test is promising enough to issue a news release about it, readers should be given some idea of when and where it might be available. We aren’t told until the very last paragraph that the research “provides the basis of tests that could improve diagnosis and, importantly, detect disease at a very early stage, with the promise even that people at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis can be followed before the disease begins.” In other words, it could be a very long way off. We think there should have been a caveat that more studies are needed or that this test may be years off before it will be ready for routine practice. Research into different proteins to diagnose RA in patients prior to the appearance of symptoms isn’t new. In fact, HealthNewsReview.org reviewed a WebMD news story on early detection of RA in 2010. Another blood test for RA is already on the market in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia.The JOINTstat test looks for another protein called 14-3-3η. The release suggests the test will “improve diagnosis” and help patients get the right treatment early in order to manage their disease. It’s too early to make such claims about a test still under development. For the reasons cited, this release does an inadequate job in placing this potential test into a larger context.",false,"Academic medical center news release,Diagnostic tests"
1022,41710,Men in Uxbridge and South Ruislip live 14 years longer than they do in Stockton North.,"January 24, 2020",Surf culture often prides itself on an affinity for nature. But there’s a dirty secret hiding in many surfers’ cupboards - old wetsuits.,Leo Benedictus,"A combination of salt water, UV rays and the wear-and-tear of life in the surf means most wetsuits only last a couple of years before they start to lose warmth and elasticity. Made from non-biodegradable rubber neoprene, surfers are often stuck with their old gear. “There’s a lot of wetsuits out in people’s garages and houses,” Tom Kay, founder of sustainable outdoor wear brand Finisterre, told Reuters from the company’s headquarters near the rugged headlands of St Agnes in Cornwall. “Most wetsuits only last two years and after that there’s no known guidance about what to do with them at the end of their life... And neoprene is a very unbiodegradable fabric,” he added. Neoprene is a widely used petroleum-based synthetic rubber known for its thermal insulation and snug fit, making it wetsuit manufacturers’ go-to choice for decades. But unlike many plastics that can be broken down and recycled, neoprene is a ‘thermoset’ where its molecules are locked in position. “It basically means that it’s processed in a way that can’t (easily) be reversed. So that’s why it’s so challenging to recycle,” explained materials scientist-turned fulltime wetsuit designer Jenny Banks, who is employed by Finisterre specifically to figure out how to bring recycling into the wetsuit industry. She added that traditional wetsuit design also involves the use of fabric linings which pose further challenges when it comes to recycling. After two years of research and experimentation, they’ve created what they believe is the first fully recyclable wetsuit. “We’ve been trying to find other ways to keep the wetsuit performing and staying strong and having reinforcement but actually eliminating the (nonrecyclable) fabrics,” said Banks. The first prototype was recently tested by Kay in the surf. It was warmer than his usual wetsuit, he found. Some tweaks were needed on the fit and ease of getting in and out of, “but it’s a really exciting start. We are still testing before we refine for the next prototype,” he said in a statement. When it does hit the shelves, Finisterre says its price must be comparable to a regular wetsuit. Eventually, the team says they want to make the design construction open-source in a bid to help the wetsuit industry as a whole become more environmentally friendly. “We want to say to bigger brands ‘look, we can do this’ and if we can do this together, we can all do it,” said Banks.

Lanier said it was uncertain at this point how many of the roughly 10,000 Pinnacle lawsuits would be subject to the settlement. He declined further comment. A spokeswoman for DePuy on Monday declined to comment. Bloomberg first reported on the settlement talks. In 2013, DePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. The Pinnacle system continues to be sold with other material combinations. Metal-on-metal hip implants have come under scrutiny over allegations that the products cause a build-up of metal ions in the blood, causing groin pain, allergic reactions, bone erosion and tissue death. J&J denies those allegations, saying the company acted appropriately and responsibly in the development, testing and marketing of the devices. Last month, J&J agreed to pay $120 million to resolve deceptive marketing claims by several U.S. states over metal-on-metal hip implants. DePuy said the settlement involved no admission of liability or misconduct on the part of the companies. J&J to date has faced several federal jury trials over the Pinnacle hip implants. It won the first case in 2014, but lost all subsequent trials, with verdicts ranging from $151 million to $540 million. J&J has appealed those verdicts. News of the settlement talks on Monday caused a federal judge overseeing an ongoing Pinnacle trial in Dallas to dismiss the jury in that case.

1025,14845,"Ted Cruz tried to ban contraception"" five times.","December 2, 2015","The post on Clinton’s website claims ""Ted Cruz tried to ban contraception"" five times. There’s little doubt that Cruz is a strong opponent of abortion, and as such, he and other anti-abortion advocates find certain types of contraception objectionable. But the Clinton campaign’s examples don’t exactly show Cruz trying to push across-the-board bans on contraception. The strongest conclusion about Cruz’s views that one could draw from these examples is that he might support a ban on certain types of contraception (but not all) through his support for a personhood amendment. The other examples are even more limited and deal with what employers would be required to pay for, for instance, or whether a major birth control provider should continue to receive federal funding. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",Louis Jacobson,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called out Republican rival Ted Cruz for a contradiction on contraception after Cruz made a widely aired comment about condoms on his college campus. It started when Cruz mocked a consistent charge from Democrats that Republicans are against birth control during a Nov. 30, 2015, campaign stop in Bettendorf, Iowa. ""Last I checked,"" Cruz said, ""we don’t have a rubber shortage in America. Look, when I was in college, we had a machine in the bathroom, you put 50 cents in and voila. So, yes, anyone who wants contraceptives can access them, but it’s an utter made-up nonsense issue."" The Clinton campaign didn’t think much of his comment, challenging Cruz with a post on its website headlined, ""Ted Cruz says no one's trying to ban contraception. Here are 5 times Ted Cruz tried to ban contraception."" It added, ""Cruz has personally tried to make it harder for women to get birth control."" The post’s fine print includes more nuanced language than the headline lets on -- that Cruz is ""trying to limit access to contraception,"" ""tried to make it harder for women to get birth control,"" and is pursuing policies that ""could ban some forms of birth control."" The details in the softened (and more accurate) statements are lost in the blaring headline that Cruz ""tried to ban contraception"" five times."" None of the Clinton campaign’s examples supports the idea that Cruz seeks a flat-out ban on contraception. The Clinton campaign took issue with our characterization of the post, saying that they never meant for the headline to say that Cruz tried to ban all contraceptives on five separate occasions. However, we think ours is the most obvious interpretation of the language in question. 1. ""The time he supported a so-called personhood amendment, which could criminalize abortion and could ban some forms of birth control."" This example offers the most support for Cruz trying to ban contraception, but it still overreaches. Cruz signed a ""personhood affirmation"" circulated by Georgia Right to Life this summer that commits him to a ""human life amendment"" to the U.S. Constitution that would define life as beginning at fertilization. As we have noted, the impact of such proposed ""personhood"" amendments on birth control is in dispute. Opponents, along with some legal scholars and medical organizations, say that giving a fertilized egg all the rights of a person could make several FDA-approved contraceptives illegal. But that would depend on how courts interpret personhood. A ""personhood"" provision has not yet passed at the federal or state level. Even more complicated is the meaning of ""fertilization,"" according to a 2011 op-ed in the New York Times by Glenn Cohen, co-director of Harvard University’s Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics, and Jonathan Will, law professor at Mississippi College. Fertilization, they wrote, could mean at least four different things: ""penetration of the egg by a sperm,"" successful combination of the genetic information from sperm and egg, activation of the genetic information, or implantation of the embryo in the uterus, Cohen and Will wrote. Sperm penetration occurs almost immediately, but implantation can take up to two weeks. ""Thus, on some reasonable readings of the amendment, certain forms of birth control ... would seem impermissible, while on other equally reasonable readings they are not."" A relatively narrow judicial interpretation could allow the use of the pill and intrauterine devices, or IUDs, while a broader interpretation may not. But even if an enacted personhood amendment was interpreted by judges in the most expansive fashion possible, it would still not limit spermicides and -- notably given Cruz’s comments -- condoms, since these prevent fertilization from taking place at all. So the first of Clinton’s examples holds some plausibility as supporting evidence for her overall claim, but it’s overly broad in suggesting that Cruz would ban all contraception and more speculative than she lets on. 2. ""The time he was willing to shut down the government to cut funding from Planned Parenthood."" Cruz was indeed willing to shut down the federal government if lawmakers and President Barack Obama maintained federal funding of Planned Parenthood. (Combined, state and federal funding accounts for about 41 percent of Planned Parenthood’s yearly revenue, or about $528 million, according to the group’s most recent annual report.) ""It will be a decision of the president's and the president's alone whether he would veto funding for the federal government because of a commitment to ensuring taxpayer dollars continue to flow to what appears to be a national criminal organization,"" Cruz said in August 2015. But even if this shutdown had happened -- and it didn’t -- the result would have been more indirect than an attempted ban on contraception. At most, it might have hampered the ability of individuals to receive contraceptives from one specific provider, albeit a significant one. 3. ""The time he called for the Supreme Court to turn women’s personal health decisions over to their employers by striking down the Obamacare birth control co-pay provision"" in the Hobby Lobby ruling. In Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that a closely held, private corporation could decline on religious grounds to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. Hobby Lobby’s Christian owners said they objected to four of 20 Food and Drug Administration-approved forms of contraception that prevent implantation of the embryo. These include two forms of emergency contraception, also known as the morning-after pill, and two forms of intra-uterine devices, or IUDs. (The FDA considers these four methods to be contraception, but the company’s owners consider them to be a form of abortion.) The way the decision was written leaves some question about whether closely held, religious companies can choose to opt out of supporting any of the remaining 16 forms of contraception in their health plans. Already, some companies have been allowed by lower courts to stop paying for a wider range of contraceptives than were at issue in the Hobby Lobby case, though some of those cases are still working their way through the courts. Still, Cruz’s support for the Hobby Lobby decision does not by itself mean that he supports banning all contraceptives. First, the case involved employer co-payments for contraceptives, making it financially harder but not impossible for an individual to obtain contraceptives. And second, that case involved only four of the 20 FDA-approved contraceptives; whether the Supreme Court might some day support a broader interpretation that permits closely held companies to opt out of all contraceptives remains to be seen. 4. ""The time he tried to get rid of a law that made it so women couldn’t be fired for their personal reproductive decisions (including birth control)."" The Washington, D.C., law in question -- the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014 -- says employers cannot use their personal beliefs to discriminate against an employee for his or her reproductive health choices. Cruz took issue with the law in his capacity as a member of Congress, which is allowed a 30-day period to object to D.C. laws. (Congressional opponents were unable to derail the law, which would have also required the cooperation of Obama.) The potential to be fired or demoted from a job for using contraception is a heavy penalty. Still, opposing this bill is not the same thing as advocating for a ban on contraception. 5. ""And the time he used a medically and scientifically incorrect argument to try to ban emergency contraception."" The Clinton campaign cites an article in the liberal publication Salon.com that takes Cruz to task for saying that the federal government wants to make private companies (like those in the Hobby Lobby case) provide ""abortifacients"" to employees. The article draws a distinction between abortifacients, such as the pill RU-486, and ""emergency contraceptives"" that may be taken up to three days after unprotected sex. The medical community also draws a distinction between the two methods. The Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, for instance, writes that RU-486 ""ends pregnancy"" whereas emergency contraception ""prevent(s) unintended pregnancy."" The group states flatly that ""emergency contraception is not the same as medical abortion."" A potential gray area -- emphasized by anti-abortion advocates -- is that emergency contraception may take effect after fertilization has already taken place. Regardless of how early that occurs, this is enough for some abortion opponents to classify it as causing a pregnancy to be aborted. Setting aside this difference of opinion, it’s not clear that this example supports Clinton’s overall point that Cruz has sought to ""ban contraception."" By focusing on ""emergency contraception,"" it addresses Cruz’s position on one type of contraception but not all types. Our ruling The post on Clinton’s website claims ""Ted Cruz tried to ban contraception"" five times. There’s little doubt that Cruz is a strong opponent of abortion, and as such, he and other anti-abortion advocates find certain types of contraception objectionable.

So to sign-off my recent blogs on ice cream, I just thought I would share this most unusual ice cream flavour with readers. No, I didn’t get around to trying it myself (I promise you), but this is what it looks like if you are ever in the wonderful cosmopolitan Dutch city of Amsterdam.Although the author included. the image and said “this is what it looks like,” the post’s other image suggested otherwise:All six advertised flavors were depicted on the poster, and all were scooped hard ice cream, not soft serve.

Ben Cohen (of Ben and Jerrys famously branded ice cream impresarios) declared on HuffPo Live that they’d support making a cannabis-infused version of their sweet treats available where marijuana is legal. SO, how probable is it that we’ll see Ben & Jerry’s “Reefer Rum” or “Cheeba Cherry” in the freezer case?With the sale of almost 5 million edibles in Colorado last year, according to Time, creating a food-based marijuana product seems like a no-brainer for Ben and Jerry’s… BUT, for now, it’s not happening  … Speaking with Brian Smith, co-owner of Ample Hills Creamery, a Brooklyn-based ice-cream shop, for some ideas about making a weed-infused ice cream at home. Smith says they’ve concocted a lot of flavors that involved steeping ingredients like Cap’n Crunch, pretzels, or tea leaves, which is exactly what you would do to make a weed-infused ice cream. According to The Stoner’s Cookbook, you should cook (decarboxylate) your weed first,, but the steeping process will give you a smoother texture and a stronger potency.A separate 2015 Italian blog post said of the image:Green like pistachio, it is an ice cream that has tasty cannabis seeds at its base, however free of THC, the famous active ingredient, mixed with milk and vanilla, and with the addition of a tasty caramel.A flavor that many have liked and that has already received hundreds of bookings from ice cream makers from all five continents, happy to rely on the experience of MEC3, the Italian company that invented and produces it.That claim did have some basis in truth — a product known as One Love Hemp Gelato by Italian company MEC3 went viral in March 2017. But as The Daily Meal noted, the product offered no psychoactive effects:As medical marijuana sweeps the nation, and more states and cities are legalizing greenery, one product, cannabidiol from Hemp Health Inc., gives you the benefits of medical marijuana without any of the psychoactive effects of the THC chemical. And now you can have these benefits in gelato form. Introducing Italian gelato and pastry products giant MEC3’s One Love hemp-flavored gelato. Cheekily named after Bob Marley, the ice cream product is completely legal in all 50 states because it does not contain any THC: just the hemp plant minus the munchies and paranoid thoughts. But the good news is that the ice cream does taste exactly like marijuana. Watch out, Ben & Jerry’s, these guys are ahead of the marijuana ice cream game.CNN Travel also reported on the product in March 2017, reiterating that MEC3’s One Love hemp-flavored gelato would not produce the high associated with cannabis edibles:Perleco, a gelato parlor in Alassio, recently launched the gelato — named Marley after reggae legend Bob. But while it sounds like a weed fiend’s dream, its makers say the frozen treat isn’t going to get anyone high.“Cannabis has a very intense flavor,” Aldo De Michelis, who created the flavor with son Mauro and wife Emanuela Baudana, tells CNN.CNN also featured an image of the flavor — which was neither green nor soft serve:Consistently, the image was mislabeled and presented as an accurate depiction of “cannabis ice cream,” often alongside blog posts or content about cannabis-flavored ice cream.Origin of the ‘Cannabis Ice Cream’ ImageAlthough image crawlers first tagged the photograph of two green soft-serve ice cream cones in October 2014, it was still older than that.The first iteration of the image we found was shared on April 13 2014, by Tumblr user lychei (archived).

Those words actually come from a sarcastic critique of Greenspan’s words by Noam Chomsky, not from Greenspan himself.",Louis Jacobson,"Amid a stubbornly slow economic recovery, a reader recently forwarded us a social media post taking aim at former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan for using callous language about worker insecurity. The post features images of Greenspan and says: I am Alan And, I used to run the Federal Reserve. And, I actually said this: If the workers are more insecure, that's very healthy for the society, because if workers are insecure they won't ask for wages, they won't go on strike, they won't call for benefits; they'll serve the masters gladly and passively. And that's optimal for corporations. The reader wondered if the five-time chairman of the United States’ central bank actually said something so dismissive about America’s economically left-behind. So did we. As it turns out, Greenspan didn’t say it. Instead, it's academic Noam Chomsky's take on something Greenspan said. And Greenspan and Chomsky couldn’t be more different ideologically. As a young man, Greenspan was a member of the inner circle of Ayn Rand, the libertarian thinker and novelist. (Rand would eventually stand with Greenspan when he was sworn in as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in 1974.) Greenspan was nominated for the Fed chairmanship by three Republican presidents (Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush) as well as by Democrat Bill Clinton. Meanwhile, Chomsky is an influential academic linguist who’s at least as well known for his political views. They veer sharply left and are sometimes referred to as ""anarcho-syndicalist,"" a philosophy he’s described as promoting ""a very organized society, but organized from below by direct participation at every level, with as little control and domination as is feasible, maybe none."" So how did this misattribution happen? It emerged from remarks Chomsky made to the Adjunct Faculty Association of the United Steelworkers on Feb. 4, 2014, reprinted in transcript form in the February-March issue of CounterPunch. Here are excerpts from a section of the transcript where Chomsky discusses the issue of universities hiring non-tenure-track faculty: ""That’s part of the business model. It’s the same as hiring temps in industry or what they call ‘associates’ at Walmart -- employees that aren’t owed benefits. It’s a part of a corporate business model designed to reduce labor costs and to increase labor servility. When universities become corporatized ... they want to keep costs down and make sure that labor is docile and obedient. The way to do that is, essentially, temps. … ""This idea is sometimes made quite overt. So when Alan Greenspan was testifying before Congress in 1997 on the marvels of the economy he was running, he said straight out that one of the bases for its economic success was imposing what he called ‘greater worker insecurity.’ If workers are more insecure, that’s very ‘healthy’ for the society, because if workers are insecure they won’t ask for wages, they won’t go on strike, they won’t call for benefits; they’ll serve the masters gladly and passively. And that’s optimal for corporations’ economic health. At the time, everyone regarded Greenspan’s comment as very reasonable, judging by the lack of reaction and the great acclaim he enjoyed."" We looked at Greenspan’s Feb. 26, 1997, testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Here’s a portion: ""The performance of the U.S. economy over the past year has been quite favorable. … Continued low levels of inflation and inflation expectations have been a key support for healthy economic performance. … Atypical restraint on compensation increases has been evident for a few years now, and appears to be mainly the consequence of greater worker insecurity. The willingness of workers in recent years to trade off smaller increases in wages for greater job security seems to be reasonably well documented. The unanswered question is why this insecurity persisted even as the labor market, by all objective measures, tightened considerably."" Greenspan, in his testimony, then suggests technological change and international competition as possible reasons for worker insecurity, before noting that ""suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecurity can be carried only so far. At some point, the tradeoff of subdued wage growth for job security has to come to an end. In other words, the relatively modest wage gains we have experienced are a temporary rather than a lasting phenomenon because there is a limit to the value of additional job security people are willing to acquire in exchange for lesser increases in living standards."" Chomsky’s take on the substance of what Greenspan said seems reasonably on target. However, Greenspan’s tone is far different than Chomsky’s. Greenspan’s words are explanatory and analytical, displaying none of the sarcasm that Chomsky, or the creator of the Facebook post, ascribes to them -- especially the part about workers serving their masters ""gladly and passively."" Reached by email, Chomsky confirmed that he and other economists have periodically pointed to Greenspan’s 1997 testimony, including a reference in his book, Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy. Chomsky added, ""Don’t know anything about Facebook. I don’t use it."" Our ruling The meme says Greenspan said that ""if the workers are more insecure, that's very healthy for the society"" because ""they'll serve the masters gladly and passively.""

But instead, a survey by the American College of Emergency Physicians suggests something else. The organization says President Obama's health care reform actually has had a destructive effect on the nation's emergency rooms."" (The version that aired is archived here.) But when we took a closer look, we found several problems -- including that the alleged 5-hour wait time was measured before the health care law took effect. What does 'average E.R. wait' mean? Actually, there isn’t just one definition. A study published in October 2013 by the California HealthCare Foundation offered three different measurements. The one Priebus references is ""patient arrival to being admitted to hospital as inpatient."" For California, this wait was five hours and 26 minutes -- longer than the national average of four hours and 34 minutes. But this is by far the longest of the three measures. The second longest is ""patient arrival to emergency room departure for discharged patients"" -- basically, the entire length of the visit for someone who isn’t actually admitted as an inpatient after being seen by the E.R. For Californians, this wait time was two hours and 49 minutes, once again a bit higher than the national average of two hours and 19 minutes. The third measurement is by far the shortest -- ""patient arrival to being seen by health care professional."" In California, this was 31 minutes, slightly more than the national average of 29 minutes. One might take away from Priebus’ tweet that someone going to a California E.R. can expect a wait of more than five hours just to get in to see a doctor or a nurse. In reality, they’re seeing a health professional in about a half an hour -- and if their injury or illness isn’t serious enough to keep them in the hospital overnight, then they’re on their way home in under three hours. For those patients, their entire visit is much shorter than the five hours Priebus indicates. Steven Birenbaum, a spokesman for the California HealthCare Foundation, said the wait time to see a health professional -- the shortest of the three measures -- is actually the most useful statistic in this context, because the longer figure ""mainly reflects the inpatient service and how full the hospitals is."" Julie Lloyd, a spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, said there’s no ""definitive answer"" on which measurement is better. Her group focuses more on the wait time to admission or discharge, but she said hospitals market themselves based on wait time to see a doctor. The wait time to see a doctor is likely more familiar to ordinary Americans. Are long E.R. waits really due to Obamacare? At this point, any link between the Affordable Care Act and longer E.R. waiting times is speculative at best, because post-ACA data on wait times do not yet exist. The data from the California HealthCare Foundation is from 2012 -- in other words, long before provisions of the law began taking effect on Jan. 1, 2014. ""It is too early to confirm that wait times are increasing under the ACA, due to the delay in data being released,"" Birenbaum said. Indeed, E.R. wait times ""have been a serious problem for many years,"" said Lloyd of the emergency physicians’ group. ""This is not anything new. It is often incorrectly blamed on nonurgent patients, who only comprise 7 percent to 8 percent of all E.R. patients."" The real reasons for long wait times, Lloyd said, include ""increasingly complex workups for patients, particularly older patients with multiple health problems, and the hospital practice of ‘boarding.’ ‘Boarding’ occurs when a patient admitted to the hospital from the E.R. is held in the E.R. while waiting for an inpatient bed. That ties up a bed and physicians’ attention, preventing them from getting to the next patients in line. Some patients are boarded for many, many hours."" This doesn’t mean there’s no support at all for the notion that the ACA has complicated matters for emergency rooms. An online survey of 1,845 emergency physicians, conducted in April 2014 by the American College of Emergency Physicians, found evidence that caseloads had increased since the start of Obamacare -- though even here, the results were mixed. The TV report that Priebus linked to cited this recent survey. When asked whether the volume of emergency patients in their own E.R. had changed since Jan. 1, 2014, 9 percent said it had increased greatly and 37 percent said it had increased slightly. However, a larger percentage said it had remained the same (27 percent), decreased slightly (20 percent) or decreased greatly (3 percent). And while 86 percent of emergency physicians said they expected to see an increase in emergency visits over the next three years, it’s not clear that the ACA will be the dominant -- or even a significant -- reason for this. When asked what type of long-term impact the Affordable Care Act will have on access to emergency care, ""positive"" (34 percent) outweighed ""negative"" (29 percent), with another 29 percent saying it would have no impact. It’s also worth noting that the survey data -- the only post-ACA data we have -- speaks to patient volume in emergency rooms. It doesn’t speak to wait times, which was the focus of both the KMPH report and Priebus’ tweet. Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, stood by the KMPH story the tweet cited. ""If you have to go to an emergency room, get ready to wait more than five hours,"" she said. ""Right now, that is the average wait in the state of California. Health experts say you can blame Obamacare and Covered California for that long wait and they say it's only going to get worse."" KMPH did not return an inquiry for this article. But Birenbaum of the California HealthCare Foundation added a footnote: The San Joaquin Valley, where the TV segment was reported, ""has one of the lowest rates of primary care physicians to population. It would make sense that patients often end up"" in the E.R. Our ruling In a tweet, Priebus said, ""Thanks to #ObamaCare, average E.R. wait in California is 5 hours."" The statistic was based on data from 2012 -- two years before the provisions of the ACA could have had any impact. Meanwhile, the five-hour figure is just one of three measurements of E.R. wait times -- and not even necessarily the best one. If you count from the time of a patient's arrival to being seen by a health care professional, the wait time was 31 minutes in California. Even the strongest support for the claim is far from solid: A survey of emergency physicians found signs that E.R. traffic had increased since the ACA took effect in January, but the results were mixed, and this documents patient volume, not wait times.

1030,33722,An alligator captured in the Chicago River in June 2008 was the first such creature ever found in that body of water.,"June 23, 2008",Apparently alligators have yet to get their fill of news headlines. A 4-5-foot alligator was discovered living in Humboldt Park Lagoon on Chicago’s West Side in July 2019.,David Mikkelson,"A recent news article about the Internet rumors swirling around a particular presidential candidate included a statement by the writer that he was “waiting to learn that [the candidate] put the first alligator in the New York City sewer,” an acknowledgement that a tale about the looming threat of deadly alligators silently lurking just beneath city streets has come to be recognized as a quintessential urban legend Although no hordes of alligators (mutant or otherwise) dwell within the bowels of the New York City sewer system, reports of saurians found in municipal waterways have been common newspaper fodder for over a century. Some of these accounts have been more fiction than fact, but a surprising number of abandoned, escaped, or otherwise misplaced gators — everything from infants to full-grown adults — really have been found in urban waters far from their native habitats over the years. So, I wasn’t taken aback by June 2008 news reports announcing the discovery and capture of an alligator in the Chicago River:  A 45-pound gator was captured along a stretch of the river in Chicago’s industrial South Side that was once one of the dirtiest waterways in the world but now has been restored and is full of fish, something that could have attracted the reptile. Officials think the American alligator, one of the strongest and most aggressive breeds, could have been a transplant or even a dumped pet. It was captured by volunteers from the Chicago Herpetological Society and will be sent to its native area of the U.S. southeast. What caught my eye, however, was the claim that this was the first such saurian ever pulled from that river. A UPI account opened with the following paragraph:  Animal control officials say the first alligator ever found in the Chicago River will be shipped to a wildlife sanctuary in the southeastern United States. And the Chicago Tribune reported:  Terrible things have emerged over the years from Bubbly Creek, a spot in the Chicago River that was once a churning sewer for the city’s slaughterhouses. But until Friday, nobody had seen what Bill Cox and his co-workers saw — something with a devilish underbite, sinister eyes and a cold-blooded appetite. An honest-to-goodness alligator in the Chicago River. Given the prevalence of urban alligator reports over the last century, I wondered if this was truly the first one sited at the Chicago River, or whether it was merely being reported as such because nobody recalled any earlier incident. Sure enough, a search through newspaper archives not only turned up a similar account from 1902, but one that had been published in the pages of the Chicago [Daily] Tribune itself (transcribed below):   “Look out for alligators” is the warning which fond parents soon may be giving their small boys when they go swimming in the Chicago river. An alligator two and one-half feet in length was captured in the river at the Twelfth street bridge yesterday, after Policeman Daniel McCarthy had fired four shots at it from his revolver and James Burke, a bridge iron worker, had fallen into the river in his endeavors to capture the animal. Shortly after noon Burke and McCarthy were crossing the river to get shelter in a small shanty at the east side of the stream. “What’s the matter with me?” almost shouted Burke. “What are you talking about?” began McCarthy at the same time, seeing the alligator swimming about in the river. “I’ve got them, too.” The two men watched the animal swimming about for a moment, and both agreed that it must be the “real thing.” McCarthy drew his revolver and tried four times to hit the little beast, but missed. Then Burke made a noose with a piece of heavy twine, and leaned far out over the water. As Burke tried to slip the noose over the alligator’s head he slipped and fell head foremost into the river. After some trouble he managed to climb out of the water, and, nothing daunted, he renewed his efforts to capture the alligator. A few minutes later Burke succeeded in lifting the animal out of the water and took it to the little shanty near by. Later it was placed in a barrel of water.",false,"Critter Country, alligators, Not Necessarily The News, nucleation"

So is it possible that the pandemic has left it with the highest-ever unemployment rate in the country? ""Well, we did it!"" a Facebook post declares. ""Minnesota now has the highest unemployment rate in U.S. history. Yesterday we surpassed the peak of the Great Depression."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It was updated a few times in subsequent days with different numbers, but was taken down after we started work on this fact check. The post is ambiguous about whether it refers to a record high for Minnesota or for all states throughout U.S. history. The post alluded to the national unemployment rate of roughly 25% during the Great Depression as a benchmark, but state records are not available for that period. And there is no officially reported unemployment data for Minnesota to back up the claim. As of May 6, the date of the Facebook post, Minnesota’s most recently reported unemployment rate was for March. At that time, its jobless rate was among the lowest in the country, at 2.9%. Minnesota has since reported data for April, which reflect more pandemic-related shutdowns and show unemployment jumping to 8.1% — still second-lowest in the country behind Connecticut’s 7.9%; Nevada was highest, at 28.2%. The national rate was 14.1%. There are indications that Minnesota’s jobless rates could head much closer to that Depression-era mark, though at this point, that is speculative. The time lag in reporting unemployment rates means that the officially reported data don’t fully reflect the trends in the number of people filing unemployment insurance claims week to week. So even as Minnesota was reporting strong jobs numbers, signs of a much greater unemployment problem were already appearing. On April 16, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on data suggesting that close to one in five Minnesota workers was unemployed or had lost work in the previous six weeks. On May 6, Minneapolis TV station Fox 9 reported that Minnesota had received 624,873 unemployment filings, amounting to 20% of the state's workforce, since mid-March. Mixing measures, that news report said the percentage rivaled unemployment rates during the Great Depression, when rates pushed towards 25%. The Facebook post attacks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a member of the state’s Democratic Farmer-Labor Party, as being the ""first governor to force 25% of our workforce out of jobs."" The post also refers to federal figures. But at that point, Minnesota’s reported rate was nowhere near that high. ""Once we have the data, it may well turn out to be true that on May 6, Minnesota — and indeed the nation as a whole — may have had the highest unemployment rate in history, including the Great Depression,"" University of Minnesota economist V.V. Chari told PolitiFact. ""My own guess is that we do have the highest unemployment rate in history now, but until we have the data, it is only an educated guess. Too early to say it quite as definitively as the poster puts it."" In 1933, during the Great Depression, the national unemployment rate reached 24.9%, although that’s an annual rate, and a different measure from what is used now by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Chari and Brian Hannon, an economist at the bureau, said there are no official state figures during the Depression period. A Facebook post claimed that amid the COVID-19 outbreak, ""Minnesota now has the highest unemployment rate in U.S. history."" There is no official unemployment rate to back the claim. At the time of the post, on May 6, the most recently available data were for March and showed Minnesota’s unemployment rate at only 2.9%. Later data for April showed Minnesota still with one of the nation’s lowest jobless rates.

1033,21167,"Attacks on Planned Parenthood ""come at a time when the poverty rate among women is the highest in nearly two decades and 1 in 5 women under 65 don’t have access to health care.","November 2, 2011",Tim Ryan says the poverty rate for women is highest in two decades,Peter Krouse,"Conservatives frequently take shots at Planned Parenthood because it provides abortions, even though the controversial procedure is but a small part of what the health care organization provides. Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee, led by Florida Rep. Cliff Stearns,  launched an investigation in September 2011 into Planned Parenthood by demanding that it provide years of information about its federal funding and its compliance with abortion restrictions. This didn’t sit well with Rep. Tim Ryan, a Ohio Democrat from Niles, who called the investigation a baseless, ideological attack on Planned Parenthood, which he described as a trusted provider of health care to millions of people, ""many of whom would otherwise not receive vital services like pre-natal care, well woman exams and cancer screenings."" Among those Planned Parenthood treats are the poor, according to Ryan. In a news release Sept. 28, he detailed just how those numbers are increasing in the United States:  ""These attacks come at a time when the poverty rate among women is the highest in nearly two decades and 1 in 5 women under 65 don’t have access to health care."" We will leave the debate over abortion rights which is at the center of this flap to Ryan, Stearns and others. But PolitiFact Ohio took a look at Ryan’s claims about impoverished women without health care. The stats back up the first part of the claim -- that the poverty rate among women is the highest in nearly two decades. Ryan based his information on an analysis by the National Women’s Law Center of U.S. Census Bureau data. It shows that the poverty rate for women ages 18 to 64 rose to 14.5 percent in 2010, the highest rate in 17 years. Furthermore, the number of women it classifies as living in extreme poverty (with incomes less than half of the federal poverty level) checked in at 6.3 percent, the highest rate over the 22 years the measurement has been taken. What about the second part of Ryan’s claim; that 1 in 5 women (or 20 percent) under 65 don’t have access to health care. Ryan again relied on the National Women’s Law Center analysis, only what the organization more precisely stated is that the number of uninsured women between the ages of 18 and 64 rose to 19.7 percent in 2010. That figure counts only women who had no coverage of any kind, private or public, for the entire year. Ryan’s statement equates not having insurance to not having access to health care. While a woman, or any person for that matter, without health insurance finds it much more difficult or expensive to get medical treatment, there are places they can go, at least in an emergency. Many physicians will see an uninsured patient if they are dogged enough and the ailment severe enough, said Henry Aaron, senior fellow with the Brookings Institution in Washington, but that’s asking an awful lot of the patient. And non-profit hospitals are obligated to stabilize patients with serious conditions, he said, but perhaps not to provide follow-up treatment. ""The whole thing is your treatment is delayed,"" he said. Those without insurance also find it more difficult to get simple check-ups and then to find a doctor who will write a prescription, Aaron said. They are often embarrassed to ask for charity or to run the risk of being refused. ""(Being uninsured) just leaves barriers, psychological and financial, to acquiring health care,"" he said. Ryan reinforced that point when we contacted his office. ""This economic barrier to health insurance obstructs many women from obtaining the most basic health care,"" he said. ""While these women are legally guaranteed treatment to stabilize emergency conditions at some hospitals, this promise falls far short of the access to medical care most of us depend upon to stay healthy and safe. It's shameful that in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, we have allowed women to reach such a high level of poverty."" Planned Parenthood is part of the safety net of health care providers for the indigent, said Tara Broderick, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio. Less than 30 percent of its clients have health insurance. Those who don’t have insurance are billed on a sliding scale, she said. As for abortion services, nationally, only about 10 percent of Planned Parenthood’s clients receive an abortion or an abortion pill, Broderick said, and the percentage locally is even smaller. The 50,000 people (primarily women) who visited one of Planned Parenthood’s 13 offices in Northeast Ohio last year were more likely to receive non-abortive birth control assistance or medical check-ups such as pap tests, breast and pelvic exams and blood work for checking cholesterol levels or for evidence of diabetes, Broderick said. So, how do we rate Ryan’s statement? Before returning to Ryan’s statement, we note one other point Aaron made.There is a wide enough difference in the amount of health care that someone with insurance receives compared to someone without insurance that there is ""something"" about Ryan’s statement that conveys truth, he said. Politifact Ohio would agree. On Ryan’s first point about the rate of poverty for women, census data backs his assertion. On the second part he said 1 in 5 women age 18 to 65 don’t have access to health care. That differs from the census database, which said 1 in five do not have health insurance. That’s a point that needs clarification. And that also consistent with  Ryan’s underlying point, that the number of women in poverty is at a high point, and that getting access to health care would be difficult for many women without services of agencies like Planned Parenthood.",true,"Ohio, Health Care, Poverty, Women, Tim Ryan, "

Last week, Georgia Right to Life accused Karen Handel of supporting abortion if a fetus tests positive for Down syndrome. We gave that claim our lowest rating, . Now Handel's opponent, Nathan Deal, stands accused of voting to fund abortions while he was a U.S. congressman in 1993. The Deal-Handel runoff is slated for Aug. 10. The winner will face former governor and Democrat Roy Barnes in November. Erick Erickson, an influential blogger and editor of RedState.com, one of the most popular conservative sites on the Web, was the first to make the claim. It appeared Thursday on RedState.com and Erickson's PeachPundit.com, which focuses on state issues. The Macon city councilman supports former Secretary of State Handel's bid. ""In Congress, Nathan Deal Voted for Henry Waxman sponsored legislation to give $500 million to Planned Parenthood to pay for actual abortions,"" he wrote in identical items on RedState.com and PeachPundit posted after 8 p.m.  Deal? The candidate who won the endorsement of Georgia Right to Life? He voted to fund abortion with our tax dollars? We fired off an e-mail to Erickson, who replied that the issue has ""nothing to do with Nathan Deal who I don't doubt is pro-life."" It's more about GRTL's conduct, he said. So we took a look at his blog posts. The earliest item we located was ""Georgia Right To Life Supports Candidate Who Voted For Major Abortion Funding,"" which was posted on PeachPundit.com at 8:14 p.m. An identical one appeared on RedState.com at 8:24 p.m.   ""Hypocrisy, thy name is Georgia Right to Life,"" the post began. It then stated a few paragraphs later that Deal voted for the Waxman legislation. Waxman is a Democratic congressman who represents portions of the Los Angeles area. Planned Parenthood runs family planning clinics, some of which perform abortions. Monday, Erickson wrote a 5 a.m. post that repeated the claim. ""Deal explicitly voted to fund abortions,"" it said. Deal voted for the Family Planning Amendments Act of 1993. It passed the U.S. House of Representatives but not the Senate. It never became law. It was an authorization bill, which is a kind of legislation that establishes or re-establishes a government agency or program. It also recommends how much money should be spent on it. This bill would have re-established the Title X program of the Public Health Service Act, which has funded family planning services such as providing birth control since 1970. The beneficiaries are mostly poor women. A portion of those funds go to Planned Parenthood clinics. Title X was authorized in another bill that passed. Amounts set by authorization bills are not binding. The feds don't cut any checks until another type of legislation, an appropriations bill, passes the House and Senate. So the 1993 bill didn't really fund anything at all, much less abortions. Furthermore, the bill had nothing to do with ""actual abortions."" Title X explicitly states that ""none of the funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning."" This has been the rule since the program began. If a clinic that receives Title X funding also performs abortions, it must make sure none of that federal money goes to those services. For instance, if women getting abortions share a waiting room with those who receive federally funded family planning services, the clinic can't bill the government for the entire cost of running the waiting room. It must subtract the proportion that goes to pay for patients waiting for abortion services. Whether the 1993 bill was anti-abortion is debatable, said Mary Harned, staff counsel for Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion group. That year, President Bill Clinton issued an executive order rescinding what was called the ""gag rule,"" which prohibited clinics from discussing the option of abortion with patients. This bill would have made it more difficult for a subsequent administration to reinstate the rule. Deal received 90 percent and 94 percent ratings from the anti-abortion group National Right to Life during the latter half of the 1990s, which means he supported its agenda almost all the time. It's likely that Deal would not have voted for a similar bill later in his career in Congress, a campaign spokesman said. He has since come to believe that if the federal government provides any funding for Planned Parenthood, it frees up their funds for pro-abortion efforts. During his last two terms in Congress, Deal received 100 percent ratings from National Right to Life. Erickson's claim crumbles in the face of the facts. The Family Planning Amendments Act of 1993 didn't fund anything. What it would have done was re-authorize a federal family planning program that is explicitly barred from funding abortions. Funding for actual abortions was never up for debate, and the bill never passed. Erickson earns a .",false,"Abortion, Georgia, Women, Erick Erickson, "
1038,17768,"Emergency rooms account for ""2 percent of all health care spending.","October 28, 2013","Gillespie said emergency rooms account for ""2 percent of all health care spending."" Experts told us that’s not the only way to calculate it, but it’s a credible way, and even if that figure is too low, other calculations put it in the single digits. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",Louis Jacobson,"In recent years, advocates for universal health coverage have regularly decried a side effect of having no health insurance -- the use of emergency rooms as a substitute for basic health care services. For instance, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said in August 2009, ""We have 48 million people with no health care. As a result, they walk into emergency rooms. It's costing every American who is insured $1,100 to pick up the cost of uncompensated care that goes on at the emergency room."" We gave Boxer’s claim this rating, largely due to questionable assumptions that undermined the calculations Boxer cited. But other Democrats in favor of a health care overhaul, including Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Barack Obama in 2009, also pointed to the use of emergency rooms by uninsured Americans as an argument for passing a health care overhaul. Given the frequency of this talking point, it came as something of a surprise to hear Nick Gillespie, the editor of Reason.com, a libertarian publication, say recently that emergency room costs actually represent a tiny share of health care spending. During the Oct. 22, 2013, edition of CNN’s Crossfire, Gillespie had an exchange with Van Jones, one of the show’s liberal co-hosts. Jones argued that Obama’s health care law should be able to bring uninsured Americans into the health care system in less costly and more efficient ways, cutting the use of emergency rooms for front-line care. Gillespie countered that ""emergency rooms (are) 2 percent of all health care spending. It's not a huge amount. That's a big red herring in this."" We wondered whether Gillespie was correct. We easily found the source of the statistic -- a calculation publicized by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Obviously, this is a group with a dog in the fight, but the calculation they made was pretty straightforward and is based on federal data. The group used figures from 2008 collected by the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a study undertaken by a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. The survey found that the total amount of money spent on emergency care -- including physician and other emergency-room services -- was $47.3 billion. That’s slightly less than 2 percent of the same survey’s $2.4 trillion estimate of total health care expenditures that year. We asked a number of experts in health care economics whether they saw any red flags with that kind ofcalculation. Both Austin Frakt of Boston University and Katherine Baicker of the Harvard School of Public Health said the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey is a credible source of data. Their concerns, to the extent they had any, focused on whether the survey under-reports health care costs. Indeed, there is at least one study that suggests just that. A paper in the Annals of Emergency Medicine used different data and an alternative accounting method to determine emergency room costs. The study -- by Michael Lee and Brian Zink of Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School and Jeremiah Schuur of Harvard Medical School -- used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, which tallied approximately 130 million ER visits, a much higher number than the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which counted 49 million visits. Based in part on this discrepancy, the authors said the actual percentage may range anywhere from 4.9 percent to 10 percent, rather than 2 percent. The American College of Emergency Physicians stands by its calculations but acknowledges that other calculations can be legitimate. The data that produced the 2 percent figure ""comes from reputable sources, and the calculation is correct,"" said spokeswoman Julie Lloyd. ""At the same time, we know that the numbers could be calculated in different ways."" Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, agreed that the percentage of health care spending devoted to emergency rooms could change depending on what figure is used for the denominator. ""All these expenditure figures are at best approximations,"" Wilensky said. ""There is no really good, precise way to calculate it."" Several experts added that the total amount of money going to emergency care is ultimately less important than making sure that emergency rooms are used for the right type of care. Services provided in the ER do tend to cost significantly more than services provided in a primary-care setting. ""Getting anything other than true emergency care in an emergency department tends to be an expensive, fragmented way to receive care and should be avoided if any other reasonable alternative is available,"" Wilensky said. That said, recent academic studies have suggested that the economics of emergency rooms and the larger health care system are more nuanced than previously thought. For instance, one study by the Rand Corp. suggested that it may be overburdened primary-care doctors -- not patients -- who are driving traffic toward the ER. According to Arthur Kellermann, one of the authors of the RAND paper, doctors described the ER to researchers as their ""overflow valve"" where they ""send complicated patients"" for diagnosis. Even Lee, who co-wrote the paper suggesting that ERs could account for as much as 10 percent of health care spending, has said that heavy use of emergency rooms is not necessarily a problem.

He was a supporter and advocate for the revolutionary socialist Sandinista government in Nicaragua during the 1980s. What's false: Contrary to claims of subterfuge or secrecy on his part, de Blasio has publicly discussed the deeply personal and somewhat traumatic reasons for his decision to change his name. Furthermore, while he was during the 1980s a strong supporter of the Sandinistas, de Blasio has more recently articulated a measure of criticism of the movement.",Dan MacGuill,"In May 2019, a widely shared Facebook post made several interesting claims about the personal background and history of New York mayor Bill de Blasio, who had just announced that he was in the running for the Democratic nomination for U.S. president in 2020. On 17 May, a Facebook user posted what appeared to be a photograph of de Blasio in his younger days, along with the following caption: “Meet Warren Wilhelm Jr. He worked for the Quixote Center, which strongly supported the Marxist–Leninist ruling government of Nicaragua, the Sandinista National Liberation Front. Warren, better known as Bill de Blasio, is the current mayor of New York … he also announced he’s running for president.”  Much of the post’s content was accurate — de Blasio was indeed once a strong supporter of the revolutionary socialist Sandinista government in Nicaragua — but elements of it were somewhat misleading. The Mayor of New York is not “better known” as Bill de Blasio, a framing that might suggest a certain degree of subterfuge or secrecy on his part. Rather, de Blasio was born Warren Wilhelm but legally changed his name to Bill de Blasio for personal reasons having to do with his relationship with his parents. This suggestion of dishonesty was made explicit in another May 2019 Facebook meme which incorporated the text the earlier post but added: “*None* of them are who they say they are” in apparent reference to other Democratic presidential candidates:  While de Blasio was once a strong supporter of the Sandinista regime, he has since resiled somewhat from that support and has criticized aspects of the leftist regime, important contextual information that was left out of the May 2019 memes. Warren Wihelm Jr. The 109th mayor of New York City was born Warren Wilhelm to his parents Warren Wilhem and Maria de Blasio in Manhattan on 8 May 1961. He grew up in Connecticut and later Cambridge, Mass. As a child, he took on the nickname “Bill,” as reflected in a 1979 Boston Globe profile of his accomplishments as a 17-year-old student leader named as “Warren (Bill) Wilhelm Jr.” According to a 2013 New York Times article, which was informed by interviews with de Blasio and his family members, Warren Wilhelm Sr., a Harvard economist who received a Purple Heart in World War II, regularly drank to excess and developed a difficult relationship with his wife and children. In 1969, Maria de Blasio filed for divorce, and in July 1979, Wilhelm Sr., who had terminal lung cancer, shot himself to death in Connecticut. In an interview with the National Public Radio affiliate WNYC in September 2013, de Blasio said he had begun to identify more closely with his mother’s side of the family in the months and years leading up to his graduation from high school and his father’s eventual suicide. As part of that difficult process, he decided to add his mother’s maiden name to his own name in 1979, going by “Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm”: “I had made the initial decision even in the senior year of high school that I was starting to think about the name. … I asked for one of the diplomas or one of the certificates to have de Blasio put in as a middle name. That was in May and he didn’t die until July so already something was deep in me starting to feel like I really wanted to identify myself at least also with my mother’s side.” According to the New York Daily News, court documents show that the future mayor of New York legally changed his name to Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm in 1983. Our search of records from Kings County Civil Court in Brooklyn showed that he legally changed his name to Bill de Blasio in January 2001, although in practice he had already taken on that name for some years, as evidenced by a 1996 news article that named “Bill de Blasio” as Bill Clinton’s re-election campaign director in New York City. The May 2019 memes were correct in claiming that de Blasio had once been named Warren Wilhelm Jr., but despite the deeply personal reasons for his name changes, which relate to a traumatic family history, de Blasio has publicly discussed them, something that undermines any suggestions of subterfuge or secrecy on his part. During the 1980s, de Blasio was a strong supporter of the revolutionary socialist government of Nicaragua, formed by the Sandinista National Liberation Front, commonly known as the Sandinistas. The then-mayoral candidate acknowledged his activities in a September 2013 interview with the New York Times, which outlined his political efforts, including a brief visit to Nicaragua in 1988: Mr. de Blasio, who studied Latin American politics at Columbia and was conversational in Spanish, grew to be an admirer of Nicaragua’s ruling Sandinista party, thrusting himself into one of the most polarizing issues in American politics at the time. The Reagan administration denounced the Sandinistas as tyrannical and Communist, while their liberal backers argued that after years of dictatorship, they were building a free society with broad access to education, land and health care … Mr. de Blasio became an ardent supporter of the Nicaraguan revolutionaries. He helped raise funds for the Sandinistas in New York and subscribed to the party’s newspaper, Barricada, or Barricade. When he was asked at a meeting in 1990 about his goals for society, he said he was an advocate of “democratic socialism.” … The roots of Mr. de Blasio’s progressive brand of politics lie in the shadows of volcanoes, thousands of miles from the city he now hopes to lead, at a decaying health clinic in Masaya, a small Nicaraguan city. Mr. de Blasio, bearded, gawky and cerebral, had arrived in the city as part of a 10-day tour of Nicaragua in 1988, the capstone of the year he spent as an employee of the Quixote Center, a social justice group in Maryland. The center, founded by Catholic leaders, officially did not take sides in the Nicaraguan dispute, though much of its aid went to help families sympathetic to the Sandinistas. … In 1987, Mr. de Blasio was hired as a political organizer, soon after he finished graduate school at Columbia, earning $12,000 a year. He worked inside the Quixote Center’s Maryland office, converted apartments filled with homegrown squash and peace posters. Hunched over his desk with a phone to his ear — his colleagues likened him to “Big Bird with a beard” — he oversaw efforts to solicit and ship millions of dollars in food, clothing and supplies to Nicaragua. He also proved to be a skilled provocateur, twice being arrested during rallies against United States foreign policy that were held in the Washington area. In 1990, after the Sandinistas were voted out of power in Nicaragua, de Blasio (using the name William Wilhelm) reflected on the party’s time in government in an interview with the New York Times: “They gave a new definition to democracy. They built a democracy that was striving to be economic and political, that pervaded all levels in society.” However, speaking to the Times for its 2013 article, de Blasio somewhat downplayed his support for Sandinistas and articulated a measure of criticism of the movement: “… Mr. de Blasio said he was also not blind to the party’s imperfections. He said the revolutionary leaders were ‘not free enough by any stretch of the imagination,’ pointing to their efforts to crack down on dissent by shuttering newspapers and radio stations.” We asked a spokesperson for de Blasio’s 2020 presidential campaign whether the mayor still largely stood by his support and advocacy for the Sandinistas, or whether he had regrets about his activities at that time. We did not receive a response in time for publication.",true,Politics
1042,33703,"Mel Gibson was the inspiration for the film ""The Man Without a Face.","October 9, 2000",Note: This may well help in the understanding of why Mel Gibson’s love for the Lord is why he has made such a powerful movie “The Passion” that’s coming out February 25th to demonstrate Jesus love and sacrifice for us.,David Mikkelson,"An item that began circulating online in the latter half of the year 2000 was neither an accurate description of actor/director Mel Gibson’s early life nor a transcription of a radio piece by commentator Paul Harvey. Suffice it to say that someone took the framework of Mel Gibson’s biography and built upon it a touching but completely fictitious house of glurge:  Here is a true story by Paul Harvey. Pass it to anyone who you think would find it interesting and inspiring. You will be surprised who this young man turned out to be. (Do not look at the bottom if this letter until you have read it fully.) Years ago a hardworking man took his family from New York State to Australia to take advantage of a work opportunity there. Part of this man’s family was handsome young son who had aspirations of joining the circus as a trapeze artist or an actor. This young fellow, biding his time until a circus job or even one as a stagehand came along, worked at the local shipyards which bordered on the worst section of town. Walking home from work one evening this young man was attacked by five thugs who wanted to rob him. Instead of just giving up his money the young fellow resisted. However they bested him easily and proceeded to beat him to a pulp. They mashed his face with their boots, and kicked and beat his body brutally with clubs, leaving him for dead. When the police happened to find him lying in the road they assumed he was dead and called for the Morgue Wagon. On the way to the morgue a policeman heard him gasp for air, and they immediately took him to the emergency unit at the hospital. When he was placed on a gurney a nurse remarked to her horror, that his young man no longer had a face. Each eye socket was smashed, his skull, legs, and arms fractured, his nose literally hanging from his face, all is teeth were gone, and his jaw was almost completely torn from his skull. Although his life was spared he spent over year in the hospital. When he finally left his body may have healed but his face was disgusting to look at. He was no longer the handsome youth that everyone admired. When the young man started to look for work again he was turned down by everyone just on account of the way he looked. One potential employer suggested to him that he join the freak show at the circus as The Man Who Had No Face. And he did this for a while. He was still rejected by everyone and no one wanted to be seen in his company. He had thoughts of suicide. This went on for five years. One day he passed a church and sought some solace there. Entering the church he encountered a priest who had saw him sobbing while kneeling in a pew. The priest took pity on him and took him to the rectory where they talked at length. The priest was impressed with him to such a degree that he said that he would do everything possible for him that could be done to restore his dignity and life, if the young man would promise to be the best Catholic he could be, and trust in God’s mercy to free him from his torturous life. The young man went to Mass and communion every day, and after thanking God for saving his life, asked God to only give him peace of mind and the grace to be the best man he could ever be in His eyes. The priest, through his personal contacts was able to secure the services of the best plastic surgeon in Australia. They would be no cost to the young man, as the doctor was the priest’s best friend. The doctor too was so impressed by the young man, whose outlook now on life, even though he had experienced the worse was filled with good humor and love. The surgery was a miraculous success. All the best dental work was also done for him. The young man became everything he promised God he would be. He was also blessed with a wonderful, beautiful wife, and many children, and success in an industry which would have been the furthest thing from his mind as a career if not for the goodness of God and the love of the people who cared for him. This he acknowledges publicly. The young man . . . Mel Gibson. His life was the inspiration for his production of the movie “The Man Without A Face.” He is to be admired by all of us as a God fearing man, a political conservative, and an example to all as a true man of courage. Mel Gibson’s father did move his family from New York to Sydney, Australia, when Mel was 12, but the similarities between this piece and Mel’s real life end there. Young Mel wasn’t dreaming of “joining the circus as a trapeze artist”; he was a Catholic high school student mulling over the possibilities of becoming a chef or a journalist and ended up enrolling in the University of New South Wales’ National Institute of Dramatic Art. Young Mel had a role in the low-budget film Summer City while still a student and then appeared in a number of productions with the State Theatre Company of South Australia before the lucky break that catapulted him to stardom: being chosen for the lead role in George Miller’s action film Mad Max. A little bit of truth may have sneaked into the story quoted above at this point. The night before his Mad Max audition, Gibson reportedly came in a poor second in a barroom brawl, ending up with a face “like a busted grapefruit.” He then had to audition for the Mad Max role with a bruised, swollen, discolored, and freshly stitched face — an appearance that, legend has it, helped win over producers who wanted someone weathered and rough-looking to take the part. The beating Gibson received did not, however, leave him with “smashed eye sockets,” fracture his “skull, legs, and arms,” result in the loss of “all his teeth” or a nose that was “hanging from his face” or a “jaw almost completely torn from his skull.” He didn’t spend “over a year in the hospital,” nor did five years pass with Mel in agony before “plastic surgery restored his looks.” His face got smashed up a bit, he required a few stitches to close some open cuts, and a few weeks later he was good as new. (However, some Hollywood pundits maintain that even the milder “barroom brawl” version was a bit of fiction invented by a publicist.) Mel Gibson did direct and star in The Man Without a Face, a 1993 film about a man who became a recluse after his features were disfigured in an automobile accident, but the movie was based upon a novel by Isabelle Holland, not Mel Gibson’s life. Many of our readers have sworn to us they heard Paul Harvey recite this piece, exactly as reproduced above, on one of his broadcasts. Paul Harvey did offer a “Rest of the Story” segment about Mel Gibson on 24 June 2000, and it was a typically (for Paul Harvey) exaggerated version of the truth, but it didn’t come close to the glurge reproduced here. What Harvey reported, verbatim, was this:  In all his years as a cop, Ollie Gerrick had never seen a beating case like the one before him. The boy’s face was smashed in. His partner say he wouldn’t survive. The ambulance arrived and took him to the hospital and when he came to, the doctors told him the rest of the story. He was in the hospital and then he remembered that night in the bar. It was late the next night that the young man remembered he had an important appointment. He realized it was tomorrow. He struggled to get out of bed but the nurse restrained him. The next morning, he got out of bed and looked in the mirror and he didn’t recognize himself. Nevertheless, he went on to the job interview. Despite the bar fight in October of 1977. He showed up for a role in a movie and the producers were looking for someone unknown who was really tough looking. He got the role they were casting for. They were looking for someone to play the rugged role of Mad Max and this Australian with the beaten up face went on to become one of our best modern-day actors. We know him as Mel Gibson, and now you know the rest of the story. And now you know … the real story. The February 2004 release of the film The Passion of the Christ, financed and directed by Mel Gibson, started this legend circulating anew, often with tacked-on codas such as the following:",false,"Glurge Gallery, mel gibson"
1046,9891,UNC Hearing Loss Experts Lead Clinical Trials of FDA-Approved Hearing Implant,"September 27, 2016","Synchrony EAS (electric acoustic stimulation) hearing implant. Image credit: Med-El USA, the device manufacturerThis news release from the University of North Carolina purports to advise journalists and the public about clinical research from the university that helped gain recent FDA approval for an implantable hearing device designed for adults with a form of moderate to severe hearing loss. But this news release is a not-very-thinly veiled infomercial for the device’s maker, and a promotional piece for and by the head of the university department whose faculty members clearly stand to benefit from marketing it. The release is full of hyperbolic praise for the device (“The technology is remarkable and so were the results…”) and the university’s role in the clinical trials. But it is very light on quantitative data and information about costs, complications and side effects that would help readers judge the pros and cons of an invasive cochlear implant. The release offers no links or references to published, peer-reviewed data; to the manufacturer’s website; or notes on potential conflicts of interest. There is some useful information about the prevalence of hearing loss in the U.S. and about what is novel about the implant. But this releases reads more like a commercial brochure than an informative and educational summary for public awareness. Hearing loss is indeed a significant and growing problem and a threat to an aging population. In recent years, hearing loss has been tied by research to cognitive loss (as described in this 2013 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine), as well as social isolation, traffic accidents and a host of other physical, emotional and social ills. Because Medicare, Medicaid and other insurers do not cover the cost of hearing aids — which can run into the thousands of dollars for state-of-the-art devices — most adults who need them don’t have them. For the most severe, disabling forms of “sensorineural”  hearing loss, cochlear implants can be life-changing, and the device described in this release could have novelty and benefits in addressing both high and low frequency hearing problems. Significantly, most insurance, including Medicare, covers the cost of the device and implant surgery. But the benefits of the implants come with risks, including the need for general anesthesia, damage to facial nerves, infections, tinnitus, and numbness. Adjustment to the devices can take months of habilitative services — and removal rates remain high in some populations. Long-term effects, moreover, still are largely unknown. For all these reasons, news releases and stories about surgical implants should offer context about the benefits, risks, costs and alternatives.","Joann Rodgers, MS,Ishani Ganguli, MD, MPH,Kathlyn Stone","Neither the release nor a company web site, nor a Google search turned up information about the cost of the approved device. There are almost always out-of-pocket costs associated with implants, even when insurance coverage is good. The release claims that 97 percent of participants in the clinical trial at UNC “reported a benefit” from the device within the first year and 90 percent reported overall satisfaction. It says “on average, patients performed more than twice as well on tests of speech understanding” compared to those without the implant. It is not clear if the benefit experienced by 97 percent of participants translated into clinical (real-life) significance for patients. What exactly does “satisfaction” represent in this context? The release doesn’t specify. And how big a benefit is performing “twice as well” as patients who didn’t get the device? The answer depends on what the baseline hearing losses were for each group of participants — something not discussed in the release. There are no data at all on failures, removals, infections, etc. They are not mentioned. The release has zero information about harms, actual or potential. Readers of this release never learn anything about the age, gender, socioeconomic status, educational background, or race of participants. Nothing is learned about the implant procedure, evaluation of the patients, how participants were selected, or how they were followed in after-implant care. In short, the release doesn’t offer any particulars about the clinical research protocol that the university treated “more of” than any other participating hearing center. We can assume that the study involved multiple sites but not much more. There is no mongering and to its credit, the release provides concrete statistics on the prevalence of hearing loss. But there is some evidence of “benefits mongering.” The release needed information about funding sources for the clinical trials. In addition, the release does not explain the quoted source’s relationship to the study (although it is implied that he is helping to lead it). Although the release makes some distinction between the type of hearing loss most likely to benefit from this FDA approved device; and it explains in some detail how the device is an improvement over other cochlear implants, it isn’t clear about the overlapping benefits of newer digital hearing aids and the implants for people in the “moderate” sensorineural hearing loss category. The release notes that the device received FDA approval on September 16.and that it will be available “in coming months.” The release does a good job of explaining what is different about this device compared to other cochlear implants, notably that it is combines two technologies to address both high frequency and low frequency hearing loss. But the release would have been strengthened by noting that newer “open fit”  hearing aids also try to tackle the dual hearing loss problem for many people. The release doesn’t rely heavily sensational language.",false,Academic medical center news release

New York state reported that 4.4 of every 100,000 residents died from gun-related causes in 2016. Only Rhode Island and Massachusetts had lower rates. Massachusetts was lowest, with 3.4 gun-related deaths for every 100,000 residents. Alaska had the highest gun death rate, with 23.3 of every 100,000 people dying from gun-related causes in 2016.

That said, New York had the third-lowest rate of suicidal gun deaths  -- 2.5 for every 100,000 residents. Montana had 15.5 suicide gun deaths for every 100,000 residents, the highest in the country. New York state ranked higher in gun homicides. About two out of every 100,000 people were killed by a firearm assault in New York state in 2016.

Rick Perry's long tenure in public office, Lone Star First, an organization that's funded and supported by the Democratic Governors Association, unleashed an attack ad called ""Cracks."" It features a photo of Perry that splinters more with each charge the association levels against him. ""Twenty-five years as a politician changes you,"" a narrator says in the ad posted on YouTube Sept. 28. ""You think injecting 11- and 12-year-old girls with a controversial drug, without a parent's consent, is a good idea. You think it's right to use a government takeover of Texas homes and property so foreign companies can get rich. You spend taxpayer money on a fancy mansion while Texas faces an $18 billion deficit. On the issues, 25 years as a politician has changed Rick Perry, for the worse."" We've previously touched on Perry's past advocacy of a toll-road network, his rental digs and the budget shortfall. Now we wondered about Texas girls receiving a ""controversial drug"" without parental consent. On Feb. 2, 2007, Perry issued an executive order that required the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules mandating that Texas girls entering sixth grade receive a vaccine against the human papillomavirus. Certain types of HPV, a sexually-transmitted virus, can cause cervical cancer and genital warts. Critics said the vaccine, Merck & Co.'s Gardasil, was too new to declare safe. Some said too that Perry's order would infringe on parental rights or give girls a false sense of security, leading them to be sexually active too young. Lawmakers blocked the plans, and earlier this year, Allison Castle, Perry's press secretary, told us that the governor's office considers the mandate ""null and void."" She said Perry ""will not pursue it in the future."" At the time, we rated Perry's statement that his executive order didn't make the vaccine mandatory. But did Perry's move mean children would receive shots without parental consent? Brannon Jordan, a spokesman at the Democratic Governors Association, pointed us to three news articles to back up the statement. While the articles quoted parents expressing anger at Perry for requiring something they considered none of his business, none of the clips mention parental consent. The mandate, which was scheduled to go into effect for the 2008-09 school year, included an opt-out ""in order to protect the right of parents to be the final authority on their children's health care."" It ordered the Department of State Health Services to allow parents dissenting for philosophical or religious reasons to request a conscientious objection affidavit form. That form enables parents to enroll their children in public school even if they lack state-required immunizations. It's automatically granted as long as parents provide all required information. Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman at the Health and Human Services Commission, told us that ""the child would only get the vaccination if the parent took the child to get it."" Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman at the Department of State Health Services, said: ""Vaccines cannot be given to children without consent of a parent or a legal guardian."" Texas law lists two primary people who can consent the immunization of a child — the guardian and a person authorized under the law of another state or a court — and secondary people if the former are unavailable, including a grandparent, stepparent, or aunt. Janet Realini, a physician and president of Healthy Futures of Texas, a San Antonio-based nonprofit striving to reduce teen and unplanned pregnancies, told us that the mandate would have been no different than state requirements for numerous immunizations that Texas requires children need to attend public school, such as the polio vaccine, measles and hepatitis B. When we checked back with the DGA, spokeswoman Emily Bittner told us that she wasn't familiar with the ad. We asked to speak with someone who was, but no one had gotten back to us as we were wrapping up our research. Where does that leave us? Perry's executive order would have required Texas girls to receive a vaccine against HPV before entering sixth grade. The order included an opt-out for parents who objected to the vaccine. But there's no evidence — not a scintilla of proof — that shots would have been given without parental consent, and saying so preys on the fears of parents who objected to Perry requiring the vaccine. Parents and guardians are gatekeepers for children getting the vaccinations required for students to go to Texas schools. Perry's failed mandate would not have changed that, and the ad sounds like Perry endorsed forcing families against their will to vaccinate their children with a scary drug.

1058,30407,North Korea is now allowing the open practice of Christianity.,"May 8, 2018","YourNewsWire frequently generates clicks by latching on to the news cycle and adding their own outlandish, conspiratorial, or outright false narratives to actual news stories. For example, the site in 2017 lumped the suicide deaths of rock singers Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington in with the notorious (and utterly ridiculous) Pizzagate conspiracy theory, falsely reporting they were murdered because they were about to expose a ring of “entertainment industry pedophiles.”",Bethania Palma,"On 2 May 2018, Charisma Magazine, a monthly publication aimed at devout Christian readers, posted a story written by minister J. Lee Grady with the hopeful headline, “North Korea Will Open Its Doors to Christianity.” The article was written amid news of historic thawing of relations between North and South Korea and talk of the North dismantling its nuclear program. One day later, the notoriously disreputable blog YourNewsWire.com reappropriated the piece, for the most part republishing it word-for-word — but attaching their own writer’s name to it. YourNewsWire also rewrote the headline to misleadingly report that North Korea’s acceptance of Christianity was a done deal: “North Korea Agrees To Open Its Doors To Christianity.” But because the original story doesn’t claim that North Korea is already welcoming the free practice of Christianity, the article doesn’t support YourNewsWire’s headline. Instead, it expresses religious views about ongoing developments on the Korean peninsula and hopes that Christians will make inroads soon: When I heard the news last week about the Korean miracle—after I pinched myself to see it was a dream—I turned to Psalm 46. It says: “Come, see the works of the Lord … He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts off the spear; He burns the chariot in the fire” (vv. 8-9). God has worked this miracle. It is not the work of any politician. He has heard the prayers of his people on both sides of this conflict—and the prayers of the faithful around the world who felt North Korea’s pain. He will engineer a lasting peace in this part of the world, and open the doors wide for the gospel to flourish in a thirsty land. Before long, the churches of South Korea will freely send teams into the North with food, medicine and the message of Christ. Like a patient who has been in a coma, North Korea will awaken. The world will watch a national transformation. We are witnessing the greatest display of God’s sovereign power over nations since the Berlin Wall fell. Although the repressive state of North Korea may well some day welcome religion, it is currently de facto prohibited. Ji-Min Kang, a columnist for NK News who lived in Pyongyang until 2005, explained the dynamic in a 2014 column: North Korea’s ruling principles are based on Juche ideology, which is itself based on Marxist materialism. Karl Marx was a sharp critic of organised religion, saying it was “the opium of the people”. In essence then, the basic principles of North Korean socialism are strongly opposed to and incompatible with religious beliefs. Even though the North Korean constitution officially states that it allows the freedom of religion, this freedom simply does not exist in the North. As such, I had to learn continuously about the negative effects and harms of a religion while growing up in North Korea. This environment therefore makes many North Koreans agnostic, but some of course conduct religious activities behind closed doors, often however with serious consequences.",false,"Politics, neon nettle, your news wire"

1060,2460,Possible closure of Ohio clinic shows new tactic in U.S. abortion clash.,"August 23, 2013","When open for business, the single-story, L-shaped brick building in a run-down west Toledo neighborhood is usually targeted by sign-toting protesters pacing the sidewalk across the street while off-duty police patrol the parking lot.",George Tanber,"A sign in a neighbor’s window reads: “You Shall Not Murder.”  Toledo’s Capital Care abortion clinic, the only one in this rust belt city of 285,000, has become the latest front in the national battle over abortion rights, this one centering on a new state law that bars agreements to move women needing emergency care to public hospitals. Toledo’s clinic may have to close because its transfer agreement with a public hospital expired last month and under the new law it cannot renew it. Abortion clinics in Ohio are required to have so-called transfer agreements with hospitals under which a patient can be admitted in case of complications. In 2011, the latest year for which data is available from the health department, complications arose in 91 of 24,764 abortions performed in Ohio. The new law passed by Ohio’s Republican-dominated legislature in June blocks public hospitals from entering into transfer agreements with abortion clinics. The result is that clinics either must have arrangements with private hospitals, since those with public hospitals are barred, or be forced to close since they would be operating without the required transfer agreement in place. Eight other states require abortion clinics to have transfer agreements, including Nebraska and Wisconsin, and abortion rights groups fear Ohio’s crack down could be replicated elsewhere. “This is a brand new idea,” said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. “It wouldn’t be surprising if next year we saw this restriction appear in other states.”  A renewed push by conservative Republicans to put fresh restrictions on abortion at the state level has resulted in a rash of new legislation over the past two years. New laws have ranged from limits on insurance coverage for abortions to requirements that women considering an abortion undergo an ultrasound test, during which technicians typically are required to point out a fetus’ visible organs. Some states have extended waiting periods for those who seek an abortion, while others have zeroed in on later term abortions. Ohio’s law marks yet another approach. Backers of the legislation say a transfer agreement with a public hospital amounts to indirect support for abortion, paid by many who disagree with it. “We think it’s going to protect taxpayers who oppose abortions,” Ohio Right to Life President Michael Gonidakis said. State Rep. Lynn Wachtmann, a Republican who chairs the House health committee, helped prepare the language for the transfer agreement law, which was included as a provision in the budget bill. “The real issue with any agreement with a public hospital is the vast majority of the people in Ohio feel that no public funds or public entities should be supportive of the babykilling industry,” said Wachtmann. Opponents of the law say it will put women’s health at risk, and decry it as a maneuver to undermine the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing the right to abortion. The court has left the states free to place various restrictions on abortion. Nearly one in ten abortions performed in Ohio in 2011 was in Lucas County, which includes Toledo, according to the health department. A second abortion clinic in Toledo closed earlier this year. Capital Care Network of Toledo’s agreement with the University of Toledo Medical Center, a public hospital, to transfer patients in case of complications expired on July 31. It cannot renew that agreement under the new law. Ohio’s health director, Theodore Wymyslo, told Capital Care he is proposing revoking the facility’s license, and that it has 30 days to request a hearing. His letter was received August 6, and the clinic had not yet requested a hearing as of Friday, according to the department. “We are seeking a way to stay open,” said Dr. Thomas Michaelis, who works at the clinic. “We have lawyers who are working on this out of our main office in Columbus.”  Michaelis said if the clinic closes, women in the area will have to travel to Detroit, Cleveland or Columbus for abortions. Terrie Hubbard, identified by the health department as the owner of Capital Care Network in Columbus, did not respond to requests for comment. It was not clear if the new Ohio law would affect the state’s 11 other abortion clinics, since the measure only directly affects those with transfer agreements with public hospitals rather than private. Ohio Right to Life’s Gonidakis said he does not know of any other abortion clinic tied to one of the state’s 18 public hospitals. The health department said it was still reviewing the measure and its impact on the state’s clinics. Abortion rights groups, however, say the impact of the Ohio law could be felt beyond the Capital Care clinic. “It’s just a very shrewd way to close abortion clinics,” said Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio. “This isn’t about patient safety - this is about putting barriers between women and a safe, legal medical procedure.”  A woman waiting at a bus-stop with her infant son near the Capital Care clinic said she had considered making an appointment there when she found out she was pregnant again two months ago. But then she heard the clinic was closing. “I’m not happy,” said the 21-year-old woman, who gave her name only as “Faye.” “They made the decision for me.”",true,Health News
1063,7844,Bubble cars to provide jolt to Paris motoring.,"September 30, 2011",Bubble-shaped vehicles will appear on Paris streets next week which billionaire entrepreneur Vincent Bollore hopes will help clear the traffic-clogged arteries of the French capital as well as providing a charge to his nascent battery business.,Elena Berton,"Former French Formula One champion Alain Prost drives a BlueCar Electric Concept Car during a news conference in Le Bourget, north of Paris, February 3, 2006. REUTERS/Franck Prevel The electrically powered Autolib cars will be available for hire in a two-month trial starting October 2 at 4 to 8 euros per half hour to motorists prepared to pay a membership fee starting at 10 euros for a day of driving. The 235 million euro ($321 million) project is the brainchild of Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe, who hopes to duplicate the success of Velib, the bicycle-sharing scheme he launched in 2007 and which has been copied by several cities in France and abroad. It’s also a potential showcase for Bollore’s eponymous industrial conglomerate, which is making the BlueCar vehicles involved in the scheme and which are based on a lithium-metal-polymer battery, a different technology from the lithium-ion batteries other car makers are using. Bollore told journalists on Friday he expected the project to make a profit in a number of years. “We estimate that it will be profitable from the seventh year, and an industrial group like ours is used to (its investments) turning a profit from the sixth or seventh year,” he said. The scheme echoes increasingly popular car clubs such as City Car which allow members to hire a local car for as little as an hour at a time. “We want to persuade people to shift from the concept of owning a car to that of using a car,” Autolib General Manager Morald Chibout told Reuters. The city of Paris has spent 35 million euros ($47.8 million) in building the car rental stations, while neighboring communes have contributed 50,000 for each station. The Bollore group, which has invested 200 million euros in the project, will pay a 750 euros annual fee for each car space. Taking a cue from the success of Velib, the project is aimed at reducing the need for the private cars that hog Parisian boulevards as well as offering locals and visitors a chance to discover electric cars. The service will debut next week with 66 cars and 33 stations throughout Paris, but will expand to 3000 vehicles and more than 1000 stations by the end of 2012. The project gets underway as top automakers test the market’s enthusiasm for electric cars on a large scale in Europe. Renault SA and its Japanese sister company Nissan Motor Co, which have invested 4 billion euros in electric vehicles, have begun selling a few such cars ahead of volume production and sales set to kick off in 2012. Bollore’s cars are being manufactured exclusively for the car-sharing service. First unveiled at the 2005 Geneva motor show, the bubble-shaped four seater has been designed and manufactured exclusively for Bollore by Italian designer Pininfarina, famous for sculpting Ferraris and Maseratis. Unlike Pininfarina’s more upmarket designs, the BlueCar has been kept simple, with basic controls that are meant to be intuitive and easy to understand. The car is powered by batteries manufactured by Bollore and can travel up to 250 km between charges which will take about four hours. Bollore says the batteries are safer than the lithium-ion batteries used by most of the car industry because they are less prone to overheating. They are also more stable when being charged and discharged. With estimates for the electric vehicle market of between 20 billion and 50 billion in 2020, Bollore’s bet may pay off if Autolib becomes a success. Soaring insurance and parking costs in French cities have already persuaded 25 percent of its citizens to reduce or give up using their cars, according to a study published last year by Chronos TNS Sofres. Valentine de la Celle, a 30-year-old Parisian mother of two, would seem to be the typical target for the service. She doesn’t own a car, but expects to start using the station on Boulevard Haussmann for short trips, as she lives nearby. “We’re doing building work at home at the moment and to take things to the tip I’d have to hire a car, which is difficult,” she said. “But the scheme needs to be quick and simple, otherwise people will not use it.”   Bollore says picking up an Autolib vehicle from a station and returning it to another will only take a few minutes. Before hiring a car, drivers will have to register at Autolib’s flagship office in central Paris or at kiosks located near some stations. A driving license, ID card and a credit card will be required to sign up, along with an uncashed deposit. Users will be able to sign up for daily, weekly or annual memberships ranging from 10 euros to 144 euros for a year, with users paying more depending on the length of time the car is used. The tiered pricing system is designed to encourage hiring the cars only for short trips, said Annick Lepetit, Paris’ deputy mayor in charge of transportation. “We are not here to compete against traditional car rental businesses,” she said. Unlike traditional rental cars, Autolib vehicles will be tracked by an operational center which will be staffed 24 hours a day to help drivers who run into difficulties. “We hope other cities will contact us to adopt our system,” said Chibout. “Three cities have already called us.”   ($1 = 0.733 Euros)",true,Environment

In Northern and Central Arizona, a majority of employees at Goodwill stores were laid off. Other Goodwill operations are ongoing.",Ciara O'Rourke,"Scores of Americans have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has pushed the jobless rate to its highest point since the Great Depression. As of April 2, nearly 10 million people had filed for unemployment insurance. But getting fired for cause — as opposed to being laid off or furloughed — can jeopardize workers’ ability to collect benefits. And a recent Facebook post suggests that Goodwill exploited shelter-in-place orders to fire its employees instead of merely laying them off. ""I just want to share what Goodwill Industries just did to all their employees,"" begins the April 2 Facebook post. ""They use this pandemic to fire all their employees instead of laying them off. They did say they would hire them all back as a brand new employee with no built up benefits or vacation time. I will not be donating or shopping there again. They definitely do not care about our community only how much money they can make off of us."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Lauren Lawson-Zilai, a spokesperson for Goodwill Industries International, told PolitiFact that each of the 157 Goodwill organizations in the United States and Canada is a locally operated nonprofit with its own president and CEO. More than 96% of Goodwill’s thrift stores have closed because of state regulations in response to the spread of COVID-19, she said. But she said the Facebook post doesn’t appear to be accurate. ""Some Goodwill organizations have had to furlough their employees,"" she said. ""These employees are receiving benefits"" that vary state by state. Other Goodwill operations are ongoing in some capacity, she said. For example, 90% of Goodwills are operating business services. Local Goodwill organizations contract with commercial and government organizations, among others, ""to provide a wide range of business services, including janitorial and grounds maintenance, flexible staffing, food service ... and laundry services."" Lawson-Zilai said many are also providing job preparation skills and they’re offering online learning through Google Classroom. One Goodwill partnered with a local dry cleaner to dry clean previously donated clothes that physicians can use as smocks. At Goodwill stores in parts of Arizona, however, a majority of employees lost their jobs. In a statement, Goodwill of Northern and Central Arizona said that mandatory state stay-at-home orders led Goodwill there to ""make the very difficult decision to close our stores in order to protect the health and safety of our employees and shoppers."" The statement says ensuring the organization’s financial stability ""included the very difficult decision to part ways with the majority of employees at each store."" ""We are providing a severance package, which includes two-weeks pay, to help these team members in their transition to new employment,"" it says. ""We truly hope when this situation passes, we will be able to rehire the majority of these employees."" Lawson-Zilai said those employees were laid off because of economic constraints, not fired. The Facebook post, which was shared more than 19,000 times, drew hundreds of comments, too. Among them were comments from people who claimed to be Goodwill employees. ""As an employee of a local Goodwill retail location, I can tell you this isn’t true at my location,"" one commenter wrote. ""I’m a full-time, hourly shift manager of five years who was given the choice of working or being furloughed; I chose furlough and I will keep my health insurance, my benefits and will retain my years of employment when I return, all while being eligible for full unemployment insurance benefits."" ""As a furloughed employee I can confirm that this is a completely untrue statement,"" another commenter said. ""Health insurance is being paid in full by the company for full time employees while furloughed and accrued (personal time off) isn’t going anywhere."" Yet another commenter wrote that she was ""‘let go’ because of the virus."" ""All I was told was that I’m eligible for rehire when they allow managers to hire again,"" she said. Our ruling The Facebook post says that Goodwill fired all employees instead of laying them off. That’s not accurate. Across the country, employees at local Goodwill organizations have been laid off or furloughed, but some operations have not shuttered, according to a Goodwill spokesperson. In parts of Arizona, a majority of employees were laid off. But they weren’t fired as the Facebook post claims. We rate this post .",false,"Facebook Fact-checks, Coronavirus, Facebook posts, "
1069,10851,"New test can detect autism in children, scientists say","February 22, 2018","A small European study found increased biomarkers in the blood of 38 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when compared to 31 healthy children in the control group. This story jumps the gun by implying the results suggest these biomarkers cannot only “detect autism in children” but also “could lead to earlier diagnosis.” This speculative language appears to come directly from the lead author of the study who’s also quoted as saying “we hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors.” What would have helped this story considerably would be interviewing sources not affiliated with the study to clarify the limitations of these biomarkers, explain how ASD is currently diagnosed, and provide some much-needed context about the novelty, availability, and clinical relevance of the biomarkers studied. Autism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of problems with social communication and interaction, as well as behavioral issues that can be repetitive, compulsive, and/or disruptive in many social settings. The condition cannot be predicted or cured, so any news coverage about a potential screening method needs to be extremely cautious and pay special attention to the limitations of the study at hand, as well as include critique from independent sources. According to 2016 statistics published by the CDC, around 1.1 million American children under the age of 21 have been diagnosed with autism, with a prevalence of roughly 1 in 68 kids.","Michael Joyce, MD,Alan Schroeder, MD,Mary Chris Jaklevic","The costs for the blood and urine tests mentioned in the story are not included. A cost estimate might be speculative at this point, but it seems reasonable to expect some discussion of what specialized tests like this might cost. The story says the study found “a link between ASD and damage to proteins in blood plasma … the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma, which found children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker ‘dityrosine’ (DT) and certain sugar-modified components called ‘advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).” However, the story doesn’t include actual data, so the reader has no way of knowing how reliable these tests might be. According to the study, a computer was used to analyze several combinations of various biomarkers, and the best diagnostic association was found in children with ASD who had higher levels of DT and AGEs. The sensitivity of this model (ie. how many children with ASD were correctly identified) was 92 percent. The specificity of the model (ie. how many people without ASD were correctly identified) was 84 percent. It means that 8 percent of the children with ASD were missed by the model, and 16 percent of the children that were diagnosed with ASD didn’t actually have the condition. Although potential harms from blood or urine tests are quite minimal, the story suggests the research findings could lead to routine screening for autism. Screening tests are never completely benign; in particular — in this case — if a ‘false positive’ result led parents to believe their child had ASD when they did not … or … if a ‘false negative’ result offered false assurance that there was no ASD present. This is quite a small study which relies upon biomarkers in the blood. It can only show an association between those biomarkers and the 38 children already diagnosed with ASD. It can not prove those biomarkers cause autism. Nor can it prove — as suggested in the story — that these biomarkers can actually predict a child developing autism, or reliably diagnose a child with the condition. These limitations are not mentioned in the Guardian story. This sentence also caught our eye: “The outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method.” This is incorrect on two counts. First, as just noted, the study results do not support these blood and/or urine tests as diagnostic. Second, there is no existing diagnostic ‘test’ to compare to. There is no single diagnostic test, just as there is no cure, for autism. The story does not disease monger and does well to provide this context: “It is estimated that about one in every 100 people in the UK has ASD, with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls.” There are no independent sources. Including independent experts could have given the story much-needed context, including whether there are other studies looking for potential biomarkers for ASD. Conflicts of interest are not mentioned, and we could find none. It’s never mentioned that there is no known blood, urine, or imaging test for predicting or diagnosing autism. Diagnosis, as stated in this Mayo Clinic summary, is based solely on behavioral observations and assessments. The story mentions two damaged proteins, in particular, which researchers found in higher concentrations of the blood of children with ASD, than in blood of children in the control group. We’re not told if the tests for these proteins are routine or highly specialized. Exactly what was found in the urine isn’t mentioned. Therefore, the availability of both the blood and urine tests is unclear. We’re told the study identifies blood and urine tests “that can detect autism in children” and the tests are believed to be “the first of its [sic] kind.” However, as mentioned above, the study does not prove these blood and urine tests can predict or diagnose autism. So suggesting novelty in this way is, at the very least, premature if not sensationalistic. The story lifts quotes and almost entire sentences from a news release with no apparent original reporting.",false,"Autism,The Guardian"
1071,1286,"Scientists angry at UK visa denials for African, Asian researchers.","November 8, 2018",Scientists in Britain expressed concern on Thursday after at least 17 delegates from Africa and Asia wanting to attend a health conference in London were denied visas.,Kate Kelland,"Peter Piot, a Belgian-born microbiologist who was part of a team that discovered the Ebola virus in the 1970s and is now director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, was among those protesting against restrictive criteria for granting short-term business visas. In a letter to the interior minister, Sajid Javid, Piot said the restrictions “represent a significant threat” to the United Kingdom establishing itself as a global health and science hub when it should be showing it is “open for business”. The 17 African and Asian delegates had wanted to attend a two-day Women Leaders in Global Health conference, exploring gender balance in global public health. “This conference is a forum to promote international debate and to nurture new talent,” Piot said in the letter, a copy of which was posted on his institution’s website. “The denial of these visas not only excludes experts and emerging experts from low- and middle-income countries from participating in these global dialogues around health and health equity but it also precludes the UK from benefiting from this important knowledge exchange.”  The conference has attracted around 900 people from 70 or more countries. Among delegates due to attend are Britain’s chief medical officer Sally Davies and Soumya Swaminathan, a World Health Organization deputy director general. “All UK visa applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with UK immigration rules and guidance,” an interior ministry spokesman said in a statement. “The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that they satisfy the immigration rules.”  He said the ministry would respond to Piot once it had received his letter. Piot said the restrictive visa rules “can only deter organizations from holding future conferences in the UK”. He said his own school, a world-renowned scientific and global health institution, “is considering moving the locations of many of our large international meetings to outside of the UK so that valued global experts can participate more easily.”  Other leading scientists echoed Piot’s concerns. “If we want to continue producing the best science, producing discoveries that will improve all our lives, we need to make it easier, not harder, for researchers to travel and collaborate across borders,” said Beth Thompson, head of UK and European Union policy at the Wellcome Trust health charity.

1072,1607,"Home for the Holidays? Hold the sugar, please.","December 24, 2015","Bagged or boxed, brown or powdered, Americans are buying markedly less sugar this year, a trend nowhere more noticeable than during the holidays when home-baking picks up.",Luc Cohen,"In the biggest decline in sugar sales in at least four years, purchases have fallen 4.4 percent in the year through October, according to Nielsen data, a drop grocers attribute to growing consumer consciousness over the negative health effects of sugar such as a higher risk of diabetes and obesity. And they are seeing that trend through the holiday season, when sugar sales traditionally peak. In the month of December, retail sales of sugar typically account for almost double most other months of the year. That could pose a challenge to the politically-connected sugar industry, dominated by the Fanjul family which owns Domino Sugar, C&H, and Florida Crystals, and Louis Dreyfus, which operates the second-biggest U.S. refiner Imperial Sugar. Stew Leonard, Jr., chief executive of the Stew Leonard’s chain of four supermarkets in New York and Connecticut, has begun paring back shelf space devoted to sugar as he braces for another year-over-year decline in December sugar sales. “Sugar is a number one enemy,” Leonard said of public concern. “You can see that people are trying to cut back on it and not eating as much sugar as they used to.”  The decline in bagged and packaged sugar purchases may reflect a trend toward less baking and more consumption of store-bought desserts, which contain as much, if not more, sugar. The steady years-long shift away from bagged and packaged sugar comes as the so-called ‘war on sugar’ intensifies in the United States, with bitter debates in the past two years between government, food companies, and advocates over proposals to add labels to products containing added sweeteners. Public officials including First Lady Michelle Obama have argued that rising sugar consumption is a leading cause of rising levels of diabetes and obesity. “Sugar has become one of the new trendy enemies,” said Sean Lucan, a professor of family and social medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, New York. “It’s almost become what dietary fat was in the 1980s and 1990s.”  The majority of U.S. sugar consumption is still in food and beverage products, according to the U.S. Sugar Association, which represents sugar growers, refiners and traders, which declined to comment on the drop in bagged sugar sales. Alternative products are nowhere close to trumping traditional sugar in sales. But while sales of granulated sugar, brown sugar, confectioners sugar and sugar substitutes all slumped, sales of “all other types” of sugar - a category including unrefined sugars like jaggery and panela - grew by nearly 200 percent between 2011 and 2015 to 1.1 million units in the first 10 months of each year. In an informal survey of five U.S. grocery store chains by Reuters over the past week, participants reported a change in customer buying habits that suggests a long-term shift in tastes and supports data that shows waning appetite for sugar. Camilo Curiel, manager of a C-Town supermarket serving mainly low-income, Hispanic shoppers in Reading, Pennsylvania, said he has cut back on wholesale sugar orders after customers curbed their purchases over the past 2-3 years, though he has not yet begun devoting less shelf space to the sweetener. That decline is part of a broader trend toward healthier foods among his customers, who he said are buying less soda, boxed juice and cereal. But December, the peak sugar-buying season by far at the store, remains an exception. Retail sales of bagged and boxed sugar during the November and December months fell 2.3 percent to 203 million units between 2011 and 2014, Nielsen data show. That two-month period typically accounts for nearly one quarter of annual purchases. Purchases during the December month alone fell 3 percent over that period to 104 million units, measured in bags and boxes, the data show. Data is not yet available for the current holiday season. But market research firm Euromonitor sees sales of sugars and bulk sweeteners falling to 14.2 million tonnes in 2015, the lowest level on records dating back to 2001. Overall U.S. sugar consumption grew steadily in the past 10 years to levels not seen since before rise of corn-based sweeteners in the 1970s, but it is expected to fall off that peak in the season that ends in September 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Domino and Imperial Sugar did not respond to requests for comment on the trend. Some grocers including C-Town and specialty organic food store chain Whole Foods Market Inc have seen a surge in popularity of alternatives to traditional sugar like honey, agave, palm sugar and coconut sugar. “Customers are migrating toward less processed sugar, alternatively-sweetened products,” said Errol Schweizer, global grocery coordinator at Whole Foods. Ahold USA, which owns supermarkets including Stop & Shop and Giant Food, has not seen a decline in sugar sales, though its stores have begun reducing added sugar in private label products like yogurt and cereal, a spokesman said. “You’re never going to eliminate it, but you can see that people are trying to cut back on it,” Leonard said.",true,Health News
1074,2044,"Too fat? Study fingers one ""thrifty gene"" suspect.","December 15, 2010","Looking beyond obvious causes of obesity like overeating, scientists said on Wednesday they may have found a gene that also plays a role, one that helped our ancestors survive famines.",Julie Steenhuysen,"Targeting this thrifty gene and others with diagnostic tests and drugs offers another way to fight the global epidemic of obesity, the researchers said. Mice bred to lack this gene, known as CRTC3, can eat a high-fat diet without gaining weight, while normal mice on the same diet grow plump, the researchers found. And Mexican Americans who have an especially potent version of this gene are more likely to be obese than others, Dr. Marc Montminy of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California and colleagues reported in the journal Nature. The gene did not appear to have the same effect in whites, which supports what scientists know — that obesity is very complex. But CRTC3 is clearly important. “It slows down the rate at which the fat cells burn fat,” Montminy said of the gene in a telephone interview. The findings lend more evidence to the theory of obesity made popular in the 1960s, which held that certain people have genes that slow metabolism, making it harder to lose weight. These “thrifty genes would slow the rate of fat burning and increase your chances of surviving famine,” Montminy said. Researchers are looking for ways to prevent and treat obesity, which affects 72 million U.S. adults, or 27 percent of the population. Being obese raises the risk of heart disease, diabetes, some cancers and arthritis. Finding and countering the effects of a thrifty gene would be an obvious target,   Montminy’s team had a look at CRTC3 because it is very active in fat cells and is known to respond to signals that regulate fat burning. “When we make animals that don’t have the CRTC3 gene, these animals become lean,” he said. “If you feed them a diet that has up to 60 percent of calories from fat, their normal brothers and sisters that have the CRTC3 gene gain weight and become obese, insulin resistant and some go on to develop diabetes, but those who don’t have the CRTC3 gene remain lean and insulin sensitive.”   One effect of obesity is the body loses its ability to use insulin effectively, eventually leading to diabetes. The researchers looked for evidence of this same effect in people, and found it in a group of Mexican Americans being studied by a team at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles who had a genetic mutation of the CRTC3 gene that makes it more potent than the normal form of the gene. “Individuals with this variant had higher rates of obesity by several different measures,” Montminy said. Interestingly, non-Hispanic whites who have this same genetic variant do not have higher rates of obesity. “It means the therapies we come up with for diabetes or obesity will need to be a little bit more tailor-made, depending on the individual’s genetic makeup,” Montminy said. He said it may be possible to test people for the gene to predict who is likely to become obese, and it may even help predict who is at risk for obesity-related diseases like high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Drug companies looking for treatments for obesity might search for ways to turn down the effects of CRTC3, Montminy said.",true,Health News

The Central Park tent hospital, operated by Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian group run by the son of late televangelist Billy Graham, has since become the focus of online conspiracy theories. ""Thousands of babies and children are being brought up out of underground tunnels in New York's Central Park by military personal (sic), during the night and placed in tents brought in by Franklin Graham's Samaritan's Purse,"" one Facebook post says, in all capital letters. The children, it adds, have been captive underground since birth, subjected to torture and ""kept as sex slaves."" There is absolutely no evidence of this. A 68-bed field hospital was set up in Central Park in April to help overwhelmed hospitals treat patients with COVID-19. The hospital was made up of 14 tents used primarily for diagnosis, treatment and storage. When it first began operating, it had 10 ventilators and treated patients from Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York’s Queens and Brooklyn boroughs. Beginning April 1, an organization known as Samaritan’s Purse, working with Mount Sinai, treated nearly 200 coronavirus patients in the Central Park field hospital. The facility operated until May 5, and ""all patients under Samaritan’s Purse care"" have since been discharged, according to its website. Samaritan’s Purse said there is no truth to the claims about abused children being treated there. ""These are totally false rumors,"" Kaitlyn Lahm, a Samaritan’s Purse spokesperson, said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""We worked hand-in-hand with Mount Sinai Hospital to bring desperately needed surge capacity,"" she said. ""All patients treated at the Emergency Field Hospital were transferred from Mount Sinai to Samaritan’s Purse."" News outlets including VICE and the Associated Press have investigated the origin of the claims and linked the conspiracies to the group QAnon and its followers. QAnon ""centers on the baseless belief that (President Donald) Trump is waging a secret campaign against enemies in the ‘deep state’ and a child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals,"" according to AP reports. A post claims, ""Thousands of babies and children are being brought up out of underground tunnels in New York's Central Park by military personal (sic), during the night and placed in tents brought in by Franklin Graham's Samaritan's Purse."" The Central Park hospital treated coronavirus patients. There is no evidence to support the claim that it housed abused children released from captivity. It appears the claim originated with the QAnon conspiracy group. Samaritan’s Purse said the claims are false. We rate this claim .",false,"New York, Coronavirus, Facebook posts, "
1078,29853,A photograph shows the heart of a child who contracted a fatal case of heartworm from kissing and sleeping with a dog.,"March 25, 2019","In short, you can feel secure that your children’s cuddling the family dog will not result in any of them contracting a fatal case of heartworm.",David Mikkelson,"A Facebook post circulated in March 2019 that purported to offer a photograph of the heart of a child who died after contracting parasites from sleeping with and kissing a domesticated dog. “A bad practice is to humanize pets. I’m sending you a kid’s heart that, due to sleeping and kissing his dog, it transmitted its parasites,” the post warned. “Those parasites blocked his heart and he died here at the Children’s Hospital. Please forward this to family and friends”:  In fact, this photograph was taken from a 2012 paper published in the journal Clinical Microbiology Reviews, where it was captioned as picturing “Male and female adult worms of D. immitis in the heart of a dog,” not in the heart of a human child. D. immitis (or Dirofilaria immitis), commonly known as “heartworm” or “dog heartworm,” is a parasitic, thread-like roundworm that is spread via mosquito bites. D. immitis infections cause dirofilariasis (also known as “heartworm disease”), which can be fatal to dogs if left untreated: “D. immitis adult worms can cause pulmonary artery blockage in dogs, leading to an illness that can include cough, exhaustion upon exercise, fainting, coughing up blood, and severe weight loss.” However, as the Clinical Microbiology Reviews paper noted, “humans are not suitable hosts for Dirofilaria species,” and one of that paper’s illustrations shows that Dirofilaria infections in humans do not spread to the heart:  As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated in an article about dirofilariasis, humans become infected with Dirofilaria through mosquito bites (not from physical contact with infected canines); reported cases of infections in humans are quite uncommon; and D. immitis worms are rarely found outside the lungs in humans: Like dogs, humans become infected with Dirofilaria through mosquito bites. In persons infected with D. immitis, dying worms in pulmonary artery branches can produce granulomas (small nodules formed by an inflammatory reaction), a condition called “pulmonary dirofilariasis” … Rarely, D. immitis worms have been found in humans outside the lungs, including in the brain, eye, and testicle. A review of cases of human dirofilariasis in the United States published in 2005 lists a total of 81 cases reported in the literature since 1941, the year of the first reported case. A Healthline article that specifically addresses the issue of “Can Humans Get Heartworms from Dogs?” reiterates these same points — heartworm infections in humans are rare, aren’t transmitted by contact with dogs, don’t occur in the heart, and aren’t fatal: Heartworms are rarely transmitted from dogs to humans. In fact, only 81 cases of heartworm in humans were reported from 1941 to 2005. Both dogs and humans can get heartworm infections. But your dog can’t give it to you through their bodily fluids. Heartworms get into the bloodstream of both humans and dogs through mosquito bites. The symptoms of heartworm infections in animals and humans differ because of how they develop in the bloodstream. You may not always experience any symptoms because the heartworms will die before maturity in a human host. In humans, heartworm larvae never fully mature. As young heartworms die, your body reacts to their tissue with inflammation as it tries to destroy the heartworms. This condition is known as pulmonary dirofilariasis. Heartworms don’t live long in human blood, so you won’t need to have heartworms removed through either medication or surgery. Treatment for heartworms addresses any granulomas that appear on an imaging test that may have resulted from dead heartworm tissue buildup in your arteries. If a granuloma isn’t causing any symptoms or blockage in your arteries, you probably won’t need any further treatment.",false,Fauxtography
1079,1942,Death industry reaps grim profit as Japan dies.,"September 12, 2011","Across from a noodle shop in a Yokohama suburb, Hisayoshi Teramura’s inn looks much like any other small lodging that dots the port city. Occasionally, it’s even mistaken for a love hotel by couples hankering for some time beneath the sheets.",Tim Kelly,"Morticians prepare a body at the Lastel corpse hotel in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, September 10, 2011. Death is a rare booming market in stagnant Japan and the Lastel corpse hotel, where bereaved families can check in their dead while they wait their turn in the queue for one of the city's overworked crematoriums, is just one example of how businessmen are trying to tap it. REUTERS/Yuriko Nakao But Teramura’s place is neither a love nest nor a pit stop for tired travelers. The white and grey tiled building is a corpse hotel, its 18 deceased guests tucked up in refrigerated coffins. “We tell them we only have cold rooms,” Teramura quips when asked how his staff respond to unwary lovers looking for a room. The daily rate at Lastel, as it is known, is 12,000 yen ($157). For that fee, bereaved families can check in their dead while they wait their turn in the queue for one of the city’s overworked crematoriums. Death is a rare booming market in stagnant Japan and Teramura’s new venture is just one example of how businessmen are trying to tap it. In 2010, according to government records, 1.2 million people passed away, giving the country and annual death rate of 0.95 percent versus 0.84 percent in the United States, which is also the global average. The rate of deaths is on the increase. Last year, there were an extra 55,000 dead and over the past decade, an average of 23,000 more people have died each year in Japan. Annual deaths are expected to peak at 1.66 million in 2040 as the bulk of the nation’s baby boomer generation expires. By then, Japan’s population will have shrunk by around 20 million people, an unprecedented die off for a nation neither at war or blighted by famine. Although two decades of economic malaise has weighed on incomes, a tradition on splashing out on ceremonies means the Japanese still pay an average of 1.2 million yen on flowers, urns, coffins and other funeral expenses. It adds up to a market worth a whopping $21 billion a year, or twice what Americans spend annually on funerals. “There’s been a rush into the market,” says Teramura, who founded cemetery developer company Nichiryoku 45 years ago. Even Japan’s second biggest retail chain, Aeon, rail companies and the nation’s biggest farmers association, Japan Agriculture are getting into the business, he notes. Teramura, 71, decided a decade ago to widen his business beyond graves to funerals and he opened Lastel last year. Behind its flower box framed windows, hidden away from mourners, is an automated storage system. It stores and chills encoffined corpses, delivering them through hatches and into a viewing room, day or night, whenever friends and family come to pay their respects. Building new urban crematoriums to deal with the surge in bodies is near to impossible because nobody wants the furnaces in their back yard, explains Teramura. That not-in-my-backyard crowd is forcing cities to make do with the facilities they have, even as the body count mounts. In Yokohama, the average wait for an oven is more than four days, driving up demand for half-way morgues such as Lastel. “Otherwise people have to keep the bodies at home where there isn’t much space,” says Teramura. It also provides a captive audience to which he can market his other funeral services and wares. Joining Teramura in the funeral rush are a slew of new entrants, some of them refugees from a shrinking wedding industry. Entry to the industry is easy. There are no licenses or mandatory qualifications. All any wannabe funeral director needs is an office and a telephone. Flowers or coffins are easy to order and ceremonial halls, hearses and monks are all for hire. In the United States, by comparison, most funeral entrepreneurs need to study for three years, including a stint as an apprentice before regulators consider handing out a license. In a recent poll of 2,796 funeral industry related firms, Japan’s Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry (METI) found that a third have been in business for a decade or less. It’s becoming a wild west market in some ways, attracting the honest operators and the not so reputable too. “People tend to leave things to the funeral director and some people take advantage of that. So instead of a 100,000 yen coffin you may end up with a 1 million yen cask,” Teramura says. A lack of official oversight and a wealth of cash transactions also makes it a magnet for full fledged mobsters, or yakuza, say some industry players. A niche that the yakuza have slipped into is as brokers who introduce funeral homes to hospitals, said one funeral director, who declined to be identified. That role alone can pull in millions of dollars in commissions. Just how fast the industry is growing is hard to ascertain. METI in 2005 said there were 4,107 companies employing 49,079 people. Across the street at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, officials say there were 6,606 firms in 2006, supporting a workforce of 72,046. Yoshiatsu Mitsuhashi, who is in charge of compiling the METI survey, said that growth may even understate the pace, because the ministry changed the way it gathered data. “It probably does indicate that the number of operators is rising, but we don’t really know,” he admits. Tokyo-based Yano Research Institute said companies positioned to succeed may be former wedding organizers able to respond to growing demand for personalized services on a tighter budget — changes that have roiled the bridal industry already. Yano predicts the funeral market will be worth 1.96 trillion yen by 2015. One former wedding organizer trying his hand at the death industry is Takayuki Nakagawa. In 2002, he founded Urban Funes, which offers customized theme funerals from a converted wedding chapel in a Tokyo suburb. For recent events, Nakagawa has asked his staff to collect discarded fruit and vegetable boxes for the funeral of a greengrocer. For another, he asked them to come up with a fitting send off for father and husband who for four decades had blown half his salary on booze and gambling. “People are less bothered about following customs,” says Nakagawa in his offices above the hall where workers were arranging flutes and other memorabilia as part of a final farewell for a middle-aged woman. To make money Nakagawa, who has no qualifications as a funeral director, says he keeps his operation lean, outsourcing whatever he can. Within five years he wants to do 3,000 funerals a year, compared with 900 in the last 12 months. “The places that are struggling are those with a lot of facilities,” says Nakagawa. Those include mutual associations known as gojokai, set up to collect monthly fees from members, meant to pay a chunk of funeral expenses when they pass on. Those funds combined amount to more than 1.7 trillion yen, according to the industry association that most are members of. Over-exuberance during Japan’s Shangri-La bubble years meant they invested much of that money poorly in golf memberships, event halls and real estate, leaving many teetering on the brink of failure two decades on. The Japanese government is pushing for the industry to consolidate, cajoling stronger operators to absorb weaker ones. A round of funeral fund failures will allow investors to make at least some money for their distressed assets, Nakagawa reckons. “We aren’t ordering them to combine, but encouraging them to act in order to avoid problems for consumers,” explains an METI official in charge of overseeing the associations. “It’s difficult to give a timeline for when this issue will be resolved,” he adds. As for Lastel’s Teramura, he’s pushing ahead with expansion plans. He pulls out his mobile phone and shows a picture of an office building he just bought in another Yokohama neighborhood. When he has finished renovating it will be his second Lastel, with room for 40 bodies, more than double the first. He refuses to divulge, however, exactly where it is in case any NIMBY neighbors get wind of what he is up to and try to kill his latest corpse hotel.",true,Health News

No matter how many times fact-checkers swat down hoaxes faulting them for murders and other mischief, there’s always another conspiracy floating around, or so it seems. This time, a Facebook post suggests that the political family is responsible for more deaths than the novel coronavirus that’s infected more than 153,000 people worldwide. ""Coronavirus — 22. Clintons — 39,"" said an image posted to Facebook on March 9, 2020. The post doesn’t specify that the numbers are in reference to alleged death tolls, but comments from the original poster and other social media users make the connection clear. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In reality, there’s no proof that the Clintons have a ""body count"" or have killed people who have damaging information on them, as hoaxes about the Clintons routinely allege. These conspiracies are not new. In a 1998 fact-check of a bogus hit list that purported to name dozens of people the Clintons had killed, Snopes wrote that similar rumors had been spreading for decades. Since our start in 2007, we’ve also seen numerous Clinton-related conspiracies. We’ve debunked claims alleging the Clintons were behind the celebrity deaths of everyone from Kate Spade to Anthony Bourdain to Kobe Bryant to Paul Walker. We’ve also quashed numerous baseless rumors about the Clintons orchestrating the murders of political leaders and enemies. Recently, we debunked a Wisconsin state lawmaker’s false claim that ""more people have died from knowing Hillary"" than the novel coronavirus. As of March 15, COVID-19 had killed 5,735 people globally and 41 people in the United States, according to the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Protection. More recent news reports have the U.S. death toll topping 70 people as of March 16. As of March 9 — the date the Facebook post went up — COVID-19 had killed 3,809 people globally and 11 people in the U.S., according to the WHO and the CDC. But those numbers were lagging, as some news reports from March 8 had the U.S. number up to 22 people. Regardless of where the coronavirus death toll sits, there’s no credible evidence to substantiate the claim that the Clintons are behind the deaths of 39 people.

1082,9652,"New Stroke Treatment Saves Lives, Improves Recovery","April 25, 2016","This is a story about an invasive procedure to treat stroke patients, known as stent retriever therapy. Unfortunately, the story presents a misleading picture to readers by relying on one successful patient anecdote, and by making unqualified statements, such as “experts call the [procedure] the most major advance in stroke treatment in two decades.” Scant attention is paid to the actual benefits quantified in the study that is the meat of the story. No attention is paid to the possible harms of the procedure. Costs are never mentioned, and there is no real discussion of the quality of the evidence. Instead the audience is left with a very powerful image of an otherwise healthy 43-year-old man suffering a stroke while driving, nearly killing himself in a subsequent car crash, being treated by surgery, and being fully restored to a normal life. His experience is certainly remarkable, but the audience is given the false impression that it is representative of everyone who has undergone the procedure or might in the future. Patient stories are powerful, which is why news outlets should choose them carefully when reporting on medical treatments. The impression left with readers is that miracle-like recoveries are commonplace with this procedure. But as we discuss in more detail below, this procedure is indicated for only a very small number of patients. Since the story chose to focus on one of these relatively rare patients, we think it was crucial to provide some broader context. How many patients are eligible for such treatment? How often are they treated within the 2.5-hour window associated with the best odds of a full recovery?","William Heisel,Dan Mayer, MD,Kevin Lomangino","We found multiple studies that discuss the cost of these types of clot retrieval procedures, including this one. It would have been helpful for the reporter to have asked how much the procedures cost, on average, in the cases studied for the journal article. The story mainly discusses the benefits as they pertain to one patient. We had to read the story multiple times to realize that the study in question went beyond this one patient. A review of the study itself shows that 196 patients were part of the study, and less than half — 96 — underwent the treatment described in the story. The study says that, “In the stent retriever arm of the study, symptom onset to reperfusion time of 150 minutes led to 91% estimated probability of functional independence, which decreased by 10% over the next hour and by 20% with every subsequent hour of delay.” The story accurately reports this finding, saying, “restoration of blood flow within 2.5 hours of stroke onset was associated with minimal or no disability in 91 percent of patients.” Despite this attempt at quantification, we think the story relies excessively on an individual patient’s story that is likely not representative of the broader experience. Since the optimal time window to perform this procedure is so small, many stroke patients may not be eligible for the therapy. In addition, the story does not explain that the study was done in 39 centers and only managed to randomize 196 patients over a 2-year period. This comes out to 5 patients per center or an average of one patient every 4 months, hardly a large number (or even percentage) of stroke patients who would benefit from (or be eligible for) this technology. There are no mentions of potential harms from any aspect of the treatment studied. This is a major oversight in any story, but especially one dealing with a surgical procedure. The study itself provides an easy-to-understand explanation of how the study was conducted and under what circumstances. Details like this are missing from the news story, even basic details like how many people were studied. A closer look at the study itself would have revealed, for example, that the paper is looking mainly at the time intervals for each step in the process rather than the actual outcome of the patients, which is not directly reported, but only indirectly reported as an adjusted analysis. There is no overt disease mongering in the story. However, we’d note that with a procedure such as this, there will be a temptation to use this device more often and this could lead to “indication creep” where more patients who don’t quite meet the very strict standards of the study are offered the therapy. This could lead to poorer results than are obtained here. The story could have commented on this. Independent sources were included, but the story missed an important detail about conflicts of interest: The study was funded by Medtronic, the maker of the device used in the study. This detail was easy to find in the published paper about the study, which also provided a list of all the conflicts of interest declared by all the authors. The story hints at the procedure being better than drug therapy alone, but it does not provide an actual comparison. The story makes it clear that this procedure is not going to be widely available in the U.S. It says, “Centers accredited by the American Heart Association.currently, stent retriever therapy is offered in just a few hundred hospitals across the country, including all 96 Comprehensive Stroke Centers.” It also provides a map showing how few centers there are in the West. Novelty is not established, and it’s not even made clear how frequently this procedure is performed or how long it has been around. We’re always happy to see a story go beyond a news release — which this story clearly does with its inclusion of several independent expert sources. We have to note, however, that the release in this case actually provided more and better information than the story.",false,"anecdotes over evidence,medical devices,stent retriever therapy,stroke"
1083,36208,Children should avoid school bus stops due to a credible threat of human trafficking.,"September 6, 2019",Are School Bus Stops Now More Dangerous Because of an All-Time High in Human Trafficking?,  Kim LaCapria  ,"A back-to-school themed Facebook warning shared on September 5 2019 (archived here) declared that all school-age children must avoid all school bus stops because of an increased threat of human trafficking:Against a pastel background, black text decreed:Let NO Child walk to or Stand at a Bus Stop Alone for the rest of the school year human trafficking is at an all-time highAs we frequently note in the many fact checks we’ve done on this genre of viral text-generated image-based Facebook post, content spreading in this fashion is both easy to spread and a fantastic vector for falsehoods, scaremongering, and misinformation or disinformation — all of which Facebook excels in spreading. In this format, posts lack any supporting citations or news articles, but their easily shareable form means they are shared nevertheless.Readers here are faced with a seemingly serious warning ripped directly from the news — that “human trafficking” is a serious problem and, given the prominence and prevalence of such stories, that they are “at an all-time high” does not seem particularly difficult to believe. If you are already concerned, standing at school bus stops alone seems to definitively posed a risk for young children.Although the post lacked any meaningful proof, it still generated engagement and attracted friend tags with comments suggesting that it might be true:Still think I’m paranoid? !😩😢We checked news and law enforcement bulletins for any sweeping advisements that school bus stops had been identified as hotbeds of abduction or any indication that human trafficking is at an all-time high, but came up empty handed. Abduction is an exhaustive topic in the realm of baseless rumors and urban legends, routinely inspiring social media moral panics about malls, schools, and other purported strategies undertaken by kidnappers.And if you didn’t look closely, it might seem that legitimate connections between school bus stops and human trafficking existed. A January 2019 article in trade site School Transportation News, which was predicated on the abduction of 13-year-old Wisconsin girl Jayme Closs, began:A child abduction case in Wisconsin that recently made international headlines has refocused attention on school bus stop safety. The role that bus drivers may be able to play in better keeping their students proactively safer, is a core part of the incident and aspects to evaluate.That lead-in indicated that a link between school bus stops and the kidnapping case be made at some point. A subsequent section titled “What does this have to do with student transportation?” made mention of a passing connection to bus stops, before consulting an expert who disagreed with any potential link:As has been widely reported, court documents stated that [the abductor] said he was driving to work one morning and stopped behind a school bus on Highway 8. It was then that he said he first saw [the victim] as she boarded her school bus.“The defendant stated he had no idea who she was nor did he know who lived at the house or how many people lived at the house. The defendant stated, when he saw [Closs], he knew that was the girl he was going to take,” according to the criminal complaint. […]An expert in the field of child sexual predators told School Transportation News that Patterson’s act was not, in fact, a random bus stop incident, but instead something that Patterson could have done before.In that passage, the site draws a line between Jayme Closs being spotted at a bus stop and the kidnapping, but an expert in child exploitation disputed the suggestion and no aspect of that alleged sighting in any way differentiated bus stops from any other public location. More to the point, no safety measures involving buses could have prevented the kidnapping, and being at a bus stop made Jayme no less safe than being in any other public area.A January 2019 Reuters piece titled “Kidnapped children make headlines, but abduction is rare in U.S.” was also premised on Jayme Closs’s October 2018 abduction in which her parents were murdered and she was taken from her home. (She was later found alive.) The article delved into the relative rarity of abduction by a stranger:On average, fewer than 350 people under the age of 21 have been abducted by strangers in the United States per year since 2010, the FBI says. From 2010 through 2017, the most recent data available, the number has ranged from a low of 303 in 2016 to a high of 384 in 2011 with no clear directional trend.Hundreds of thousands of juveniles are reported missing to the Federal Bureau of Investigation each year. The circumstances of the disappearance is only recorded about half the time, but in cases where they are, only 0.1 percent are reported as having been abducted by a stranger. The vast majority, typically more than 95 percent, ran away.The FBI data does not record how many reported abductions are confirmed as actual kidnappings.“It doesn’t happen very often, but they’re certainly the cases that capture our attention because they strike at our worst fears,” Robert Lowery, a vice president at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), said in a telephone interview.In noting that there was “no clear directional thread,” we may reasonably infer that abduction is not actually “at an all-time high.” But a more striking statistic mentioned is that only 0.1 percent of cases involve stranger abduction. In 95 percent of cases, minors reported missing “ran away.” According to earlier statistics cited by Reuters, 99.8 percent of children reported missing are recovered alive.So what of the remaining 4.9 percent of abductions? The article states that a non-custodial parent is the most common kidnapper:In cases where children are abducted, it is far more common for a non-custodial parent to be the kidnapper: This was reported 2,359 times in 2017, the FBI data showed.As to whether that 0.1 percent of kidnappings classed as stranger abduction, National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, Runaway, and Thrownaway Children (NISMART) data didn’t specify bus stops as a particular threat. Further, many kidnappings do not look in real life as they might in movies or television shows:About 32 percent of those abducted were taken from a place where they were living or staying (their home, a relative’s home, a homeless shelter, etc.). Another 32 percent were abducted at the kidnapper’s home. The final 36 percent of victims were taken from a public place of some sort. Most cases featured only one victim (81 percent) and only 18 percent of cases involved a child taken from a group of two or more children. In nearly two-thirds of the abductions, the victims voluntarily went with kidnappers at first.One factor in the popularity of kidnapping panics involves the typical trajectory of investigations in a time when most people get news almost immediately after events occur, forming their opinions long before the facts of the cases are clear. After media reports of a possible kidnapping spread in March 2019 in Ontario, Canada, police later determined the child was in the custody of her father; law enforcement later learned that the father was simply picking up his daughter from school, as he was permitted to do so.An August 2019 news article in Oklahoma provided an excellent object lesson in how initial reports are spread and updates rarely seen. Both the original and amended versions of that article appeared on a single page, and authorities later determined an alleged rash of attempted kidnappings were the result of mistaken identity and courteous behavior.Human trafficking is a hot-button topic on social media, due in part to widespread ignorance about what is a legitimate and misunderstood problem. Posts heavily relying on emojis and exclamation points appear with regularity on Facebook, as do panics about Uber-related sex trafficking and a Snapchat trafficking ring (both of which have always been false.) In an earlier fact check, we noted:[E]xperts in trafficking routinely decry such claims about the issue. Experts regularly underscore the fact that sex trafficking is rarely (if ever) a “random” crime of sudden abduction; instead, traffickers tend to lure vulnerable teens over time[. ]Rationality advocate and author of Free Range Kids Lenore Skenazy has long been addressing the popularity of such claims on social media. In March 2017, Skenazy addressed a flurry of sex-trafficking Facebook panics:What the heck is going on, America? This “My kids were about to be trafficked, I just KNOW it” post is so shockingly similar to last week’s, “My kids were about to be trafficked, I just KNOW it” post that it feels…creepy. A lot creepier than being at Ikea where a couple of men glance at my kids.The reader who sent me this link asked if I thought there might be some “validity” to it, to which I must respond: No. In fact, I think it’s crazy. What, two men are going to grab two or three kids, all under age 7, IN PUBLIC, in a camera-filled IKEA, with the MOM and the GRANDMA right there, not to mention a zillion other fans of Swedish furnishings?Can we please PLEASE take a deep breath and realize how insanely unlikely that is? How we don’t need to be “warned” about this? How NOTHING HAPPENED!You can TELL nothing happened, because the whole thing was described as an “incident.” And Lenore’s #1 Rule of Reporting is: When something is called an “incident,” it’s because nothing happened. In fact, my alternate headline for this post was:POINTLESSLY TERRIFIED MOM URGES OTHER MOMS TO BE POINTLESSLY TERRIFIEDIn June 2018, Skenazy revisited the topic of phony human trafficking scares and the media’s endless tolerance for them. In that commentary, she highlighted the darker side of moral panics and the irony that they themselves can be riskier to communities than the supposed dangers themselves. After noting that “security expert Bruce Schneier has dubbed [such rumors a] ‘movie-plot threat’ — a narrative that looks suspiciously like what you’d see at the Cineplex,” she explained just how old and corrosive safety panics actually are:[David Finkelhor, head of the Crimes Against Children Research Center] has not heard of a single case in which a child was taken from a parent in public and forced into the sex trade. Zero. That’s because actual traffickers build relationships with the young people they go on to exploit, usually troubled or runaway teens. No one is spiriting away 2-year-olds from Target.These Facebook posts about fiends snatching innocent children are eerily reminiscent of a much older scare: a corrosive lie called blood libel, in which Jews during medieval times were said to be killing Christian children and using their blood to make matzo. The most famous blood libel of all, says medieval scholar Emily Rose, was the 1475 abduction and murder of a young Italian boy, Simon of Trent.Simon was not the first such story, but his went viral thanks to a brand-new social medium: print. Posters and poems disseminated the allegations. Trent became a pilgrimage destination.That’s all it took. Suddenly, people across the continent started claiming that a Christian child had been murdered by a Jew in their town, too. “Most of these kids didn’t even exist,” Rose says, “and if they did exist, they weren’t killed.” But that didn’t stop the stories from catching on. And the people repeating them were excited, because suddenly they were part of something big. A drama!Today’s panicked moms probably don’t see themselves playing a role that goes back centuries. But the only thing new is the media they’re using to spread fear.A quick browse of our pages on sex trafficking, human trafficking, Facebook warning, and parental panic tags illustrates the ubiquity and illegitimacy of warnings like the post above. No credible information indicates that school bus stops expose children to an “all-time high” risk of human trafficking, nor does anything substantiate the claim that crimes of that nature have increased in frequency. While “better safe than sorry” is the excuse routinely used to spread safety panics, as is often the case, spreading bad information inhibits the circulation of actual, legitimate, and helpful safety advice.",false,"Disinformation, Fact Checks"
1085,38799, DEW brand bottled water sold in Nigeria and other parts of Africa has caused at least 180 deaths and has been known to infect those who drink it with the Ebola virus. ,"October 20, 2015",DEW Bottled Water Has Caused 180 Deaths in Nigeria,  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"Claims that DEW bottled water causes death or has been contaminated with the Ebola virus are false. Those rumors have been repeated in chain emails and social media posts since at least 2011. One such message reads: URGENT!!!! Please, don’t buy or drink any bottled water called “DEW”. Customs says it was shipped into Nigeria from Tanzania where it has killed 180 people and now finding its way into south africa. It is said to contain ebola. Please pass this on and save millions. If u don’t believe check google for “DEW bottled water. (SFTBC)… Plz broadcast Reports of toxic DEW bottled water can be traced back to 2011. At that time, it was rumored that Dew, an unregistered bottled water that contained a poison, had made its way into marketplaces in Nigeria by way of Tanzania and had killed 180 people. The National Agency for Food Administration and Control (NAFDAC) of Nigeria said it had investigated those claims and found that they were “false and mischievous.” Still, Nigeria doesn’t allow bottled water to be imported into the country, and DEW is not among the country’s registered bottled waters, so consumers were urged to alert authorities if they saw DEW bottled water being sold in marketplaces, Modern Ghana reports: The Food and Drugs Board (FDB) has therefore advised the public to report any person who offered DEW bottled water for sale. According to a statement issued by the FDB in Accra and copied to the Ghana News Agency (GNA), the board had not registered any brand of bottled water with the name DEW. The statement, signed by the Chief Executive of the FDB, Dr Stephen K. Opuni, said rumours had suggested that the DEW bottled water had been imported from Tanzania into Nigeria and was alleged to contain a chemical that had caused the death of 180 people in that country. It said the FDB established that the rumour was false, after investigations it conducted, including post-market surveillance activities and contacts with the NAFDAC of Nigeria and the Tanzanian Bureau of Standards. So, it’s not true that DEW bottled water is poisonous and has killed 180 people. It is true, however, that DEW bottled water cannot be sold in Nigeria because it isn’t registered with health agencies there. Comments",false,Food / Drink
1086,38962, 99-year-old billionaire David Rockefeller has successfully undergone his sixth heart transplant surgery in the last 38 years. ,"May 6, 2015",99-year-old David Rockefeller Undergoes Sixth Heart Transplant ,  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"A fake news website started the false report that David Rockefeller has had six heart transplant surgeries. An article that appeared on the website World News Daily Report claimed that David Rockefeller, an heir to the billion-dollar Rockefeller estate, has had six heart transplants and two kidney transplants over the years: “His first heart transplant occurred in 1976 after a dramatic car accident led him to suffer a heart attack. He was operated 24 hours later and up and jogging a week later.” Within days, the fake news report was shared more than 130,000 times on social media. Many people believed that David Rockefeller had actually undergone his sixth heart transplant and argued about whether or not it was right for a rich, 100-year-old man to take a heart from a younger person in need. But those people missed World News Day Report’s disclaimer. It says that the website is not “responsible for inaccurate information” and assumes “all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles. This isn’t the first time that David Rockefeller’s health has been at the center of an online hoax, either. Just weeks earlier, a separate false report spread across social media that David Rockefeller had died: “At about 11 a.m. ET on Tuesday (April 28, 2015), our beloved business man David Rockefeller passed away. David Rockefeller was born on June 12, 1915 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.” The debate about wealthy people “cutting in line” to receive an organ transplant isn’t a new one. In 2009, Steve Jobs was criticized after he traveled to Tennessee for a liver transplant on short notice, ABC News reports: “Jobs couldn’t pay for an organ. Nor could he pay to cut the queue. But what someone with Jobs’ resources could do, according to liver transplant surgeons and ethicists, is to use money and mobility to improve the odds either by going to an area of the country where there are more organ donors, or by signing up at multiple transplant centers.” Dick Cheney drew similar criticism when he underwent a heart transplant in 2013. Cheney had waited on a transplant list for 20 months before the surgery, but some argued that he was too old (71 at the time) to receive a donor’s heart. The United Network for Organ Sharing, the non-profit that maintains the nationwide patient waiting list, often considers a patient’s ability to pay for a transplant when deciding where to place an available organ.

1088,29353,Boiling the same water twice will make your water dangerous to drink.,"November 12, 2015","The risks posed by reboiling water are minimal, due to the scale of concentration needed to bring any dissolved component of water to a relevant or harmful concentration. If the change of concentration caused by boiling off some water a couple of times results in dangerous water, that water was almost certainly dangerous to begin with.",Alex Kasprak,"Claims that boiling water multiple times comes with health risks have been around in various forms for years. A spate of posts on a variety of alternative health websites in 2015 added to the hysteria, with claims of all sorts of damaging health effects from reboiled water. A post from “Healthy Holistic Living” is representative of the claims made in many locations:  It’s something they never taught us in chemistry class, but really should have. When we boil water, the chemistry of it changes, which is usually a good thing as it boils out volatile compounds and dissolves [sic] gases. This is why boiling water mostly ensures that it’s safe to drink. If water is left boiled too long or is reboiled, the chemical compounds change for the worse. By leaving your water to boil down, you’re actually concentrating many harmful chemicals instead of getting rid of them … The same thing happens when you reboil water, as the compounds concentrate and increase the risk of ingesting certain chemicals.’ These chemicals could include arsenic, nitrates, and fluoride. Even the minerals that are healthy for us can become dangerous when concentrated, such as calcium salt which can lead to kidney stones and gallstones when taken excessively. The only scientific principles at play here are the concepts of evaporation and concentration, which more than likely are a component of any chemistry class. Boiling water causes it to evaporate but leave behind heavier impurities that are likely dissolved in the water, increasing their concentration. Aside from portraying middle-school science as some sort of secret health scare, these posts also, as is so often the case, ignore any discussion of scale. The implication that the water itself somehow changes into new toxic chemicals in the absence of any other factor, merely through the process of boiling, is not factual. Discussion of increasing concentrations of “arsenic, nitrates, and fluorides”, therefore, requires the presence of some amount of them in your water to begin with. Arsenic Arsenic is an undeniably toxic chemical that can, indeed, be found in both public water supplies and in groundwater. Arsenic poisoning is a major health problem in places like Bangladesh, where high levels of naturally occurring arsenic occur due to the local geology. Studying areas like these, the World Health Organization has concluded that chronic health problems may occur when concentrations reach around 50 ug/L:  In 2010, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) re-evaluated the effects of arsenic on human health, taking new data into account. JECFA concluded that for certain regions of the world where concentrations of inorganic arsenic in drinking-water exceed 50–100 μg/litre, there is some evidence of adverse effects. Assuming the water you are boiling contains the maximum allowable level considered by the EPA of 10 ug/L (which is the same as the limit recommended by the WHO), you would need to boil 80% of your water away to reach this concentration. While it is not inconceivable, especially if you are a somewhat scatterbrained individual, to boil away this amount of water from time to time, these numbers apply to chronic exposure, and as such would require all of the water you consume for every use to be boiled down by 80% — even your regular drinking water. This requirement is made even more unlikely by the fact that boiling 80% of water away in a teakettle may not leave enough for even a single cup of coffee or tea. The numbers get even more absurd when scaled up to the amount that would cause acute arsenic toxicity (i.e the amount you would have to consume all at once to see fairly immediate and serious negative health consequences). Scientists have estimated that acute toxicity occurs when an individual consumes 0.6 mg of arsenic per kg of bodyweight per day day. Using the average American female body weight of 166 lbs (75 kg), one would have to boil over 2600 gallons (nearly 10,000 L) of water down an amount that could fit in a regular coffee cup. Nitrates Nitrates, a broad group of naturally occurring chemicals containing a nitrate ion (NO3-), can indeed be found in water (and pretty much everything else one runs into on a daily basis) The concern raised in viral anti water reboiling posts is the conversion of organic nitrates to a group of carcinogens called nitrosamines:  When nitrates are exposed to high temperatures, they convert to nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic. Nitrates have been linked to many diseases such as leukemia, non-Hodkin [sic] lymphoma, and different cancers, including colon, bladder, ovarian, stomach, pancreatic, and esophageal cancer. While the risks posed by nitrosamines, a broad group of chemicals, are factual, the claim that nitrates (in general) in water will be converted to nitrosamines solely through the action of boiling is false, as their formation in drinking water requires specific precursor molecules and environmental conditions to form. The most important source of these chemicals, of which a compound named NDMA is most common, is wastewater (which generally contains high levels of organic nitrogen) that has been disinfected with chloramine, a process called chloraminiation:  Mechanistic studies and results from occurrence studies suggest that the most important mechanism for nitrosamine formation during disinfection is the chloramination of amine precursors. This means that the formation of these dangerous chemicals has everything to do with what is in the water and, outside of increasing concentration through water loss, nothing to do with boiling it. A 2011 study investigated the effect of boiling water with two different nitrosamines showed that the amount was either unchanged after 20 minutes of boiling, or reduced:  The total amount of NMOR [a nitrosamine] in boiled water did not change significantly in 5-min samples, but apparently decreased with boiling time in 10- and 20-min samples, corresponding to 18.7 and 31.8% decreases, respectively, compared to the initial amount. However, the total amount of NDMA [the most important nitrosamine] did not vary with time. This suggests that NMOR is thermally labile whereas NDMA is thermally stable. An additional study needs to be conducted on the by-products of the thermal breakdown. Now that we have cleared up the fact that the only way boiling affects nitrosamine in water is that it removes water (thereby mathematically increasing its concentration), we are returned once more to similar scale issues found in the above discussion of arsenic. Nitrosamines in water are a relatively new concern, and as such there is not much information about their variability from different water sources. A 2009 survey of drinking water in Japan found that:  NDMA was detected in 15 of 31 raw water samples collected in the summer at concentrations up to 2.6 ng/L, and in 9 of 28 raw water samples collected in winter at concentrations up to 4.3 ng/L. The NDMA concentrations were higher in raw water samples collected from treatment plants with catchment areas that have high population densities. A 2011 study of water collected from treatment plants and taps in Korea found a range of NDMA concentrations ranged between 26.1 and 112.0 ng/L. In terms of the United States, multiple wells in California in 2000 were shut down when concentrations ranging from 32 to 91 ng/L were found in water sourced near treatment plants. The takeaway point here is that there is considerable variability of nitrosamines in drinking water caused by local land use factors and water treatment methods. The effect of that original variability is far more significant than any changes that could arise from increasing the concentration of those chemicals by boiling away a fraction of the amount of water contained in a tea kettle. Fluoride As the “Healthy Holistic Living” page states, Fluoride is indeed added to water in many municipalities around the world in an effort to reduce cavities — a source of wild conspiracy theories for some and of health claims of varying merits from others:  Many studies have been done over the controversial chemical fluoride and its presence in drinking water. The fact is, it’s there and it could pose a threat to your health. Despite the proof of the dangerous effects of fluoride, the government insists to keep it in our water. Harvard University took data from over 27 studies that were carried out for 22 years and linked fluoride exposure to neurological and cognitive function in children. A more recent study completed in 2013 links fluoride to lower infertility rates [presumably the author meant higher infertility] in male mice. Oddly enough, the post makes two faulty claims of health problems while ignoring the more legitimate concern. The science linking IQ and water fluoridation, based on the study mentioned above, is deeply flawed and relies on research that was inadequate to test such a link, as we discussed in a post in which we rated that connection as false. The laboratory study with mice mentioned above, in addition to the usual problems of scaling animal studies up to human studies, found problems with fertility only at extremely high concentrations, per the study:  Our study showed that fluoride reduced the ratio of chemotactic sperm [sperm capable of following a chemical gradient to the egg] in mice by administrating with 100 and 150 mg [of sodium fluoride per liter] in drinking water for 8 weeks. Currently, the EPA’s maximum allowable limit for fluoride in drinking water is 4 mg/L with a voluntary recommendation of 2 mg/L. When fluoride is added to a public water supply, the target concentration is 0.7 mg/L — both multiple orders of magnitude less what was used in the mouse study, without even taking into account the relative size difference between humans and mice. The most significant and demonstrable health effects from fluoride in drinking water is a condition called dental fluorosis, a staining or pitting of teeth caused by too much fluoride intake. The risk of this condition is greater for children, and could occur at levels found in drinking water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:  In some regions of the United States, public water systems and private wells contain a natural fluoride concentration of more than 2 mg/L, and at this concentration, children 8 years and younger have a greater chance for developing dental fluorosis, including the moderate and severe forms. These children should have an alternative source of drinking water that contains fluoride at the recommended level. In this case, fluoridated water could pose a risk to children regardless of its being boiled with a resulting minor increase fluoride concentration, making the argument that boiling water poses a fluoridation risk somewhat moot. Even if it weren’t, the issue of scale as it applied to the other chemicals of concern, still needs to be considered here. The most aggressive estimate for the concentration at which acute fluoride toxicity may occur (promoted in an expressly anti-fluoridation journal of questionable scientific merits) is 0.8 mg of fluoride per kg of body weight. While this number is an order of magnitude less than almost every governmental health organization on the planet, we can still run the same experiment we did with arsenic using the questionable figure. Assuming the water you are boiling contains the maximum allowable level of flouride considered by the EPA (4 mg/L) and you have an average American female body weight of 166 lbs (75 kg), you would need to concentrate 15 liters of water into a 12 oz cup of tea of coffee.

Regulators have been recalling some blood pressure and heart failure medicines since last year. Britain's medicines watchdog said GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was recalling four prescription-only Zantac medicines: a syrup, an injection and tablets of 150 and 300 milligram (mg) dosages. (bit.ly/2IATooO)  Over-the-counter 75 mg dosage Zantac products are produced by a different company and are not affected by the recall, it added. “GSK informed the MHRA of our decision to suspend the release, distribution and supply of all dose forms of Zantac products,” a company spokesman confirmed to Reuters. “GSK is continuing with investigations into the potential source of the NDMA,” he said, adding that the investigations include continued engagement with its suppliers and with external laboratories to conduct tests on finished product batches of Zantac. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said healthcare professionals were told on Monday to “stop supplying the products immediately, quarantine all remaining stock and return it to their supplier”. “We are advising that patients should not to stop taking their medication, and do not need to see their doctor until their next routine appointment but should seek their doctor’s advice if they have any concerns,” the MHRA said. U.S. and European health regulators said last month they were reviewing the safety of ranitidine, after online pharmacy Valisure flagged the impurities. The FDA said Valisure’s higher-temperature testing method generated very high levels of NDMA from the ranitidine drugs. NDMA had previously been found in some blood pressure medicines from a class of drugs known as angiotensin II receptor blockers, or ARBs. After checking the over-the-counter drugs using a low-heat method of testing, the FDA said it found much lower levels of  NDMA than was discovered with a higher temperature test employed by Valisure. The U.S. regulator has asked ranitidine makers to conduct their own testing to assess levels of the impurity and to send samples of their products for testing by the agency. Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.S) halted global distribution of its ranitidine drugs last month. Last week, Walmart Inc (WMT.N) joined pharmacy chains CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) in suspending the sale of over-the-counter heartburn drugs containing ranitidine. Canada’s health authorities have asked makers of the drugs to halt distribution as they gather more information.

The shallow tremor caused more than 1,000 buildings to collapse in Turkey, prompting a brief rescue effort to find those trapped under rubble. The quake damaged buildings some 90 km (56 miles) to the west in the Turkish city of Van, and to the east in dozens of villages in Iran, where state TV said 75 people were injured including six in hospital. There were several aftershocks including a larger tremor measuring 6.0 magnitude that stuck nearby 10 hours later. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from that quake, which was also fairly shallow and potentially dangerous. Crisscrossed by major fault lines, Iran and Turkey are among the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. After the initial tremor, Turkish TV footage showed people digging with shovels and their hands in the rubble, as well as furniture and belongings strewn on cracked and snowy roads. In one village the ground cratered under several buildings, while in others residents were wrapped in blankets outside homes with crumbled and cracked exterior walls, fallen metal roofs and twisted wiring. “The damage caused loss of life,” the governor of Van, Mehmet Bilmez, told reporters standing in front of a pile of cinder blocks and sheet metal. “There is destruction in all four villages” he visited on Sunday morning, he added. The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said the quake, which hit at 8:53 a.m. (05:53 GMT), had a depth of 5 km (3.1 miles). The second big quake struck at 7:00 p.m.  Broadcasters and government officials said dozens of villages were rattled in Turkey. Nearly 150 tents were sent to shelter families in the region, where several schools in the districts of Baskale, Saray and Gurpinar sustained minor damage.

1100,9092,New research to treat acute malnutrition,"September 14, 2017","This news release describes a study published in PLOS Medicine, showing that among moderate acute malnourished infants lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS)–a kind of fortified peanut butter–produced more gain in muscle and organ weight over 12 weeks than a corn-soy blend (CSB) porridge. Acute malnutrition affects over 50 million children across the world. It is characterized by bodily wasting following experience of a recent period of starvation. According to the researchers, until now there has been concern that because LNS has a very high fat content any weight gain it produced would be composed primarily of fat. The distinction of this study is its demonstration that LNS not only resulted in more weight gain, but that weight gain was in muscles and organs (lean mass) rather than fat. Children with the most severe level of acute malnutrition are at risk of death. Increasing the effectiveness of interventions with children before their malnutrition becomes severe could save millions of lives. However, readers would take away a better understanding of this critical issue if more space in this news release had been devoted to explaining the study itself, and less to citing various researchers and partners about how important the project was.","Ann Miller, PhD,Virginia A. Moyer, MD,Kathlyn Stone","No comparison is made in the news release between the cost of the current corn-soy blend (CSB) nutrient supplement and the alternative lipid-based supplement. This is strange considering that the original study devotes some space to addressing the issue of cost-effectiveness. The researchers conclude that although LNS is about twice as expensive as CSB, the possibility that it could require a shorter treatment regimen, is easier to prepare, and has a longer shelf life could make it more cost-effective in the long run. They call for detailed cost-effectiveness studies to inform policy decisions, a point that goes unmentioned in the release. The primary outcome in this study was weight gain that was not primarily fat; it is important to note that this study did not address survival or neurodevelopment, which are the presumed benefits of greater fat-free weight gain. The news release tells us that children who received LNS gained more weight than children on the corn-soy porridge, and that weight was primarily lean mass. It doesn’t tell us how much more weight they gained, nor does it describe the difference in progression to severe acute malnutrition. Studies with large samples like this one can give results that are statistically significant even when differences are small. Specific information about the size and clinical importance of the difference should have been included. Many people’s first question upon reading about a peanut buttery kind of nutrient supplement might be whether it produced any allergic reaction or other side effects in infants. In fact, it didn’t, but the news release doesn’t tell us that. Readers are told there were two arms of the study, the treatment lasted for 12 weeks, and children’s lean mass was assessed afterward. It would have been better if the news release mentioned that children were randomly assigned to treatment. Nevertheless, the basics for understanding how the study was conducted are provided. No mongering here. It would be pretty much impossible to engage in disease mongering about acute malnutrition. The major funding sources for the study are listed, but financial relationships between two of the authors and Nutriset, a producer of LNS products, were not included in the release. According to the published study they are Nutriset patent holders. The study is all about comparing widely used alternatives about which there have been long standing questions of relative benefit. The news release assumes availability of both types of supplements, though no specific information is provided about how much each is currently used for treatment of moderate acute malnutrition in infants. This piece gives the impression that across the globe most current interventions for infants with moderate acute malnutrition use CSB as a nutritional supplement. The original study itself presents a somewhat different picture, noting that there is currently no consensus on which of the two food supplements is better, and citing a World Health Organization recommendation that more research needs to be done. The news release claims in the first paragraph that “corn-soy porridge should be replaced with  a lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS)” [emphasis ours]. The researchers in the original study are careful to qualify their recommendation with the need for a cost-effectiveness analysis as well as more study about the role of soy and milk in food supplements.

The Royal British Legian are not selling poppies in certain areas on Nov 11 this year. This is because some minorities say that it will upset them.

BRITISH CITIZENS STAND UP AND SAY ‘WE WANT THE POPPY SOLD EVERY WHERE IN THE UK’. THIS IS OUR RIGHT TO REVERE OUR FALLEN.. PLEASE RE-POSTFar from being “shocking news,” the post is a claim that has been debunked many times, by many news outlets, for many years. It even recalls the equally xenophobic — and also thoroughly debunked — rumors about so-called “no-go zones,” where even trained law enforcement supposedly fears to tread, because certain ethnic groups have purportedly taken over specific areas. As we have already reported, this has not happened, and in fact the person who first made the claim has since apologized:Rumors of “no-go zones” throughout Europe have frightened many a far-right activist, at least judging by the amount of false stories that they seem to exhaustively share about such areas without any evidence to back up claims that they even exist.There is no evidence that they exist, because “no-go zones” are nothing more than a myth spun up and perpetuated by individuals who are presumably too nervous about going to these purported zones to see for themselves.Stories about these “no-go” areas were floating around on the fringes for years before they were brought into the mainstream by an American Fox News pundit named Steven Emerson, who made the claim on Fox News on January 11, 2015, just after an attack on the offices of French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo in which twelve people were murdered. […]For his part, Emerson issued an apology on his website and explained that he had used unreliable sources in making his comments about Birmingham:I have clearly made a terrible error for which I am deeply sorry. My comments about Birmingham were totally in error. And I am issuing this apology and correction for having made this comment about the beautiful city of Birmingham. I do not intend to justify or mitigate my mistake by stating that I had relied on other sources because I should have been much more careful. There was no excuse for making this mistake and I owe an apology to every resident of Birmingham. I am not going to make any excuses. I made an inexcusable error. And I am obligated to openly acknowledge that mistake. I wish to apologize for all residents of that great city of Birmingham.As the Royal British Legion told the British site FullFact:We are aware that there are statements online suggesting the poppy is not being offered in certain areas of the country. We’d like to reassure you that this is categorically untrue. We are proud to offer the poppy in every community in the UK — we always have been and always will be.Another fact-checking site, ThatsNonsense.com, broke down the nature of the lie in September 2015:Numerous variations of the above messages have circulated previously, but none of the them have been able to support their spurious claims that the Royal British Legion have ever been prohibited from selling poppies in any part of the UK because of causing offence to minorities.Such messages are an extension to the on-going far right narrative that claims ethnic minorities are destroying or diluting British culture, forcing their own own culture onto British people, or forcing British people to compromise on their own traditions or values. However, this narrative often relies on misinformation and propaganda to spread, and this is definitely the case with the above message concerning poppies.The significance of the poppy as a way to honor fallen service members dates back to World War I, when John McCrae, a lieutenant colonel in the Allied forces, noticed the bright red flowers continuing to bloom amid the fighting across France and Belgium. As the History Channel reported:McCrae wrote a poem, “In Flanders Field,” in which he channeled the voice of the fallen soldiers buried under those hardy poppies. Published in Punch magazine in late 1915, the poem would be used at countless memorial ceremonies, and became one of the most famous works of art to emerge from the Great War. Its fame had spread far and wide by the time McCrae himself died, from pneumonia and meningitis, in January 1918.McCrae’s poem sparked campaigns of solidarity in the United States, France, and throughout the United Kingdom. Shortly after forming in 1921, the Royal British Legion sold nine million poppies as part of a fundraising drive for housing and jobs for veterans. Since then they are worn every November 11, a holiday known as Armistice Day or Rememberance Day in several countries.“Wearing a poppy is still a very personal choice, reflecting individual experiences and personal memories,” the group said on its website. “It is never compulsory but is greatly appreciated by those who it is intended to support.”However, the rumors about “angry minorities,”which are as perennial now as many poppy species, are nothing more than disinformation and lies which emerged out of white supremacist far-right fever swamps, were laundered of their origins by groups such as UKIP and the Brexit Party, and are routinely pushed on the public by activists and politicians who personally or politically benefit from widespread xenophobia.",false,"Disinformation, Fact Checks"

1103,33232,"In the last ten years no one has died of measles in the U.S., but more than 100 people have died due to the MMR vaccine.","February 4, 2015","Finally, the possibility of death is not the only reason one should (or should want to) vaccinate a child against measles. As the CDC notes in their measles fact sheet, in some children measles can lead to pneumonia, lifelong brain damage, and deafness.",Kim LaCapria,"During a then-current measles outbreak, on 4 February 2015 the alternative health site Health Impact News published an article claiming no one in the United States had died of the measles since 2003. Furthermore, the article stated, more than 100 people (mostly young children) had died after receiving the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. The article circulated widely during a time of increased debate over parental decisions about vaccinations, particularly among those who are opposed to the practice. In some iterations the statement was amended to specify “child deaths,” but the article itself stated there were zero deaths (among all age groups) from measles in the United States in the timeframe cited. That claim is inaccurate, as the CDC has reported that a Washington woman who passed away in early 2015 died from (an initially undetected) measles infection:  The death of a Clallam County woman this spring [2015] was due to an undetected measles infection that was discovered at autopsy. The woman was most likely exposed to measles at a local medical facility during a recent outbreak in Clallam County. She was there at the same time as a person who later developed a rash and was contagious for measles. The woman had several other health conditions and was on medications that contributed to a suppressed immune system. She didn’t have some of the common symptoms of measles such as a rash, so the infection wasn’t discovered until after her death. The cause of death was pneumonia due to measles. This tragic situation illustrates the importance of immunizing as many people as possible to provide a high level of community protection against measles. People with compromised immune systems often cannot be vaccinated against measles. Even when vaccinated, they may not have a good immune response when exposed to disease; they may be especially vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Public health officials recommend that everyone who is eligible for the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine get vaccinated so they can help protect themselves, their families, and the vulnerable people in their community. According to the World Health Organization, 145,000 people around the world died of measles in 2013 alone, and documents on the CDC web site also record two U.S. deaths from the measles in 2009, and another two deaths from measles in 2010. (Other sources, including the CDC, sometimes confusingly cite 2003 as the year of the last previous recorded measles death in the U.S. According to the CDC, that difference is due to the 2003 death being listed as “confirmed,” while the other cases have statuses of “reported” or “suspected” but not “confirmed.”) The Health Impact News article also failed to address the reason why measles killed so few Americans in the period cited. The glaring omission had a very specific root cause, namely measles elimination:  In 2000, the United States declared that measles was eliminated from this country. The United States was able to eliminate measles because it has a highly effective measles vaccine, a strong vaccination program that achieves high vaccine coverage in children and a strong public health system for detecting and responding to measles cases and outbreaks. Measles elimination is defined as the absence of continuous disease transmission for 12 months or more in a specific geographic area. Measles is no longer endemic (constantly present) in the United States. It stands to (very simple) reason a timespan beginning in 2004 (four years after measles elimination) and ending just before the late 2014 outbreak would see few (albeit not zero) deaths from measles, because the viral infection had been largely eliminated from the United States during the period specifically selected to illustrate the purported innocuous nature of measles. The second portion of the claim entailed deaths attributed directly to the MMR vaccine in the same period. Even if a minute number of fatalities were proved to have resulted from the MMR vaccine, it would still be impossible to accurately contrast that figure with deaths due to a disease no longer spreading in the United States during the period selected. That speculation itself, however, is a big “if.” According to the article, their figures for MMR deaths were culled from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), but VAERS does not exist to track specific and proved adverse reactions to vaccines. The purpose of the system is clearly denoted on the VAERS site (in a disclaimer not reproduced by the article spreading the claim):  When evaluating data from VAERS, it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause-and-effect relationship has been established. Reports of all possible associations between vaccines and adverse events (possible side effects) are filed in VAERS. Therefore, VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination, be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event. Submission to VAERS alone is not evidence of vaccine-related injury or illness. The overwhelming majority of young children residing in the United States receive the MMR vaccine early in their lives, and a small number of those children have become ill (some fatally) due to reasons found to be unrelated to the vaccine. There is nothing to preclude individuals from submitting VAERS reports of sickness or death that are wholly unrelated to vaccines, and the system exists not to track substantiated incidents of vaccine injury but to identify potential trends in vaccine administration. Few people died of measles in the U.S. between 2004 and 2015 because measles was classified as eliminated in 2000. Relatively few people in the U.S. contracted the viral infection after that, so it stands to reason far fewer would go on to die of it. And while more than 100 reports of suspected adverse reaction or death may have been reported to VAERS in the years cited, that number references unconfirmed public reports, not verified vaccine-related fatalities.",false,Medical
1104,36123,Butchers just cut cancer out of diseased meat and sell the rest of the contaminated carcass.,"October 4, 2019","‘When We See Cancer in Pork, We Just Cut It Out And Still Sell It To Customers’ Claim",  Kim LaCapria  ,"A February 2018 post (“An Experienced Butcher Admits: “When We See Cancer In The Pork, We Just Cut It And Still Sell It To Customers””) circulated widely on Facebook in October 2019, inspiring a fresh round of users vowing to never again eat any pork products.Images accompanying the post were presumably responsible for the viral spread of the claim, which were used to illustrate the purported discovery of cancer in pork on a butcher’s table:One widely circulated iteration was published by EducateInspireChange.org on February 20 2018:Meat eaters might want to reconsider their diet choices.A butcher has shocked the world by saying that when coming across cancer in pork, he and many other butchers just cut it out, and continue to sell to customers.When you buy meat from a butchers, you expect that you are usually buying the best quality, better than supermarket standard, but this has been shown not to be the case.Meat cuts are very expensive, and this butcher has been honest about the process that the meat goes through before selling. I guess it would be mad for a butcher to throw a whole cut away just because there was a problem with one part of it.There is no legal obligation for butchers to give information about cancers in the meant to the customers.The article strongly implied — but did not state outright — that the following image was part of the purported claim, and that the quoted butcher shared it as an example:In the above excerpt, the second half of the first paragraph linked to what presumably constituted the basis of the claim and headline. But it wasn’t a news item or other vetted claim; instead, the link simply brought users to a November 2017 tweet. That included an image of a different piece of purportedly diseased pork, along with an unverified claim:I worked in a meat market for 5 years, this is very true. pic.twitter.com/g7NWguDvSb— ☥Lucky☥ (@Wisethedome) November 16, 2017EducateInspireChange.org likely didn’t carefully read that tweet’s discussion thread. Although its headline described the Twitter user as an “experienced butcher,” they actually described themselves specifically as a one-time supermarket employee:I worked at one the largest grocery store retailers on the east coast and all the grocery stores get there meats from pretty much the same companies. You don’t have to believe me, I KNOW what I’ve seen.Notably, in the article excerpt above, EducateInspireChange.org contrasted this person’s knowledge as a purported butcher with that of an average supermarket worker in their content:When you buy meat from a butchers, you expect that you are usually buying the best quality, better than supermarket standard, but this has been shown not to be the case.To reiterate, their claim contrasting supermarket meat with butcher meat specifically was predicated on differences between the sources — but they got the information from a purported supermarket employee, contradicting their own stated reasoning.Furthermore, the Twitter user said that they were vegan, and that they regularly shared content about the dangers and perils of eating meat:I been vegan 6 years i been posting about this stuff, for years you just seeing it posted today. 🤷🏽‍♂️Being vegan in and of itself is absolutely not cause to distrust a claim, but in this case, the commenter was a supermarket worker — not a butcher as was later claimed, and espoused a clear and admitted anti-meat viewpoint. From subsequent comments, it appeared that they did not actually describe themselves as a “butcher,” much less an “experienced butcher.”A screenshot included with the post featured an image not crawled until the tweet went viral in November 2017, and its source remains unclear. EducateInspireChange.org wasn’t even the first site to use “An Experienced Butcher Admits: “When We See Cancer In The Pork, We Just Cut It And Still Sell It To Customers”” as their headline. In December 2017, the site TheUnknownButNotHidden published an article with an identical headline:This guy said he’s been a butcher for 30 years and when he sees cancer in the pork he just cut it out then they still sell the meat to customers.Both articles included images that in part formed the basis of their claims. The same month the tweet appeared (November 2017), a commenter shared the image to Reddit’s r/ThatHappened, a subreddit where users share stories that, to them, seem obviously fake:Cancer in Pork from thatHappenedCommenters were divided; some mused that it was impossible to contract cancer from eating cancerous meat, and others asserted that the “tumor” was in fact garlic butter. Without a source, determining the circumstances of the image definitively was impossible. That particular image did resemble the Kiev style of wrapping meat around herbed butter, and the image looked like at least one image tutorial for pork Kiev.In October 2017, another Reddit user shared a similar image to the site’s r/whatisthisthing.Is this cancer in my pork? from whatisthisthingIn the top comment on that thread, a commenter claimed their butcher friend identified the substance and advised “those are glands and should not be eaten.” Another speculated the image showed “abscesses,” which might have a high concentration of bacteria.As for the other popular image depicting cooked, sliced pork, that too seemed to originate on Reddit via r/mildlydisgusting. That poster didn’t explain the image’s origin:Tumor in pork from mildlydisgustingIf that Reddit post was the image’s first appearance on the internet, the image was not presented as either originating with a butcher or showing cancer in retail meat. If it was accurately titled, the meat could have been obtained through a farm directly, or been raised by a private livestock owner. As no information was given, no explanation was certain.Rumors of cancer in meat circulated in 2012 and 2013 too, once again bolstered by images shared to Reddit and later removed from their context. In 2013, a post to r/skeptic included debate about the image. Originally, the same image (without captioning) was shared to r/popping — a subreddit devoted to draining pimples and abscesses.In the 2012 version, the submitter admitted to “finding” the image and not having taken it themselves. After the photograph circulated, the “cancer in pork” rumor spread on separate subreddits. In the 2013 r/skeptic discussion, a user opined:Looks like a spinal abscess, i.e a localised collection of pus separated from the surrounding tissue by a fibrous capsule. Happens occasionally. No respectable establishment is going to be serving that, though. It’s not sanitary, it stinks and the meat surrounding the abscess is toughened. Depending on the amount of contamination (those things can be quite pressurised and when cut into the puss will just spray out) a thing like that may lead to a large chunk, if not the whole of the carcass being condemned.Another self-identified “meat industry” insider agreed with the assessment, adding possibly informed context. According to that user, butchers and other meat processors don’t “just cut it and sell it.” All efforts are made to detect and discard diseased meat, although the individual maintained it happened solely through error:As someone who has worked in the meat industry for the last 8+ years, I can confirm that this is exactly right. We see these things all the time. Usually, they are caught and excised by QA’s or “meat inspectors”. Sadly though it is fairly common that they are missed. For around two of those 8 years, I worked in an area that involved sorting the “finished” product, and I was pretty disgusted to see how often these things are missed. It may not end up on your plate often, but it’s the middleman who will end up furious most of the time.In response to a question about how common such oversights are, the same commenter replied:[Chances you’ll see infected meat are very] small. It will get past the people who are too bored to do their job properly, but once it hits the butcher who’s selling to you, he has a very vested interest in keeping your food clean and presentable, lest he lose customers. Which is why it is he as the middle man who gets so frustrated. He just wants to sell an edible product, but ends up doing a lot of the work he has already paid the wholesaler for and he’s losing good product/weight due to careless work further back in the chain.Bottom line is that consumers really don’t need to worry about this. It’s not unheard of, but if it does happen it will be pretty obvious and you should most definitely take steps to make sure whomever is accountable is held as such.That comment was published in 2013, four years before the articles and tweet went viral. In it, the user correctly states that butchers have a vested interest in avoiding the handling and sale of infected pork and other meat — it harms their business and inhibits repeat custom. According to the two circulating articles, butchers finding cancer in meat “just cut it and sell it to customers,” a practice that would have only negative consequences for their business.A tweet embedded above that served as a citation for both articles was shared on November 16 2017. On November 21 2017, a butcher Jon Viner did a Reddit AMA (“ask me anything“) inviting questions about butchery from the Reddit community ahead of Thanksgiving:IamA butcher with more than 30 years of experience here to answer your questions about meat for Thanksgiving or any time of year. AMA! from IAmANeither of the two subsequent articles (“An Experienced Butcher Admits: “When We See Cancer In The Pork, We Just Cut It And Still Sell It To Customers”) had yet been published, but a user submitted a question with a virtually identical title:Is it true that if you see a cancerous part in the animal you just cut it out and keep the rest of the meat to cut and sell?Viner explained standard procedure for butchers when infected meat is discovered:No, at work when I come across something like that, we discard everything. We gotta clean our saw, we clean everything, that’s contamination. Like a cyst, something like that, we discard all the meat.Interestingly, the thread of questioning seemed to mirror claims that would eventually appear in the viral article. The next user asked if there was a correlation between high-end sources and supermarkets:Can you elaborate on this? Is that something that I would normally find on something I buy in a higher-end supermarket with a good butcher (like Stew Leonard’s)? Is there something I should look for?Viner again responded, adding that meat processors discard the entire carcass irrespective of whether the retail destination was “high-end”:No, there really isn’t [something consumers should look for]. It’s just like [illness in] people – you don’t know it until you find it, and when we do, we get rid of the whole animal. We don’t want to let our consumers have any of that.On November 22 2017, meat scientist Janeal Yancey, Ph.D. addressed what was clearly rapidly spreading viral nonsense on her meat-focused blog. Yancey said that friends had been asking her about the viral tweet quite a lot as it circulated.Yancey maintained that most meat “comes from young animals who would be very unlikely to have cancer, adding that any “animal with cancer would be very sick and would be condemned on the kill floor by the inspector.” Correctly observing that “pictures like these aren’t about safety or public health; they are about generating clicks and shares and fame for the originator,” she confirmed that the picture is “not cancer” but “an abscess, a localized infection that the animal’s body was fighting.”Yancey then reiterated what commenters had been saying for years, that there are “several barriers that keep abscesses out of a retail butcher’s hands,” explaining:Abscesses like this one would be very rare to find in a butcher shop. Our meat supply is one of the most inspected industries in the world. Not even hospitals and nursing homes are inspected like meat plants are. Employees of the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service inspect every single animal as it goes through the harvest process. In a big commercial plant, dozens of pairs of eyes will look at every carcass. When an abscess is spotted, it is removed immediately. If an animal has been sick, USDA inspectors will see the signs of illness in the animal’s lymph nodes and internal organs. Sick animals are condemned and not allowed to go into the food supply.As Yancey observed at the end of the post, the virality of such claims was itself an indicator that tumors or cancer in butcher meat or pork could not possibly be as common as rumors suggest. No good explanation was apparent for why more butchers didn’t speak out, but more compellingly, why Facebook and Instagram were not awash in images of pus-filled pork. TruthOrFiction.com has done numerous pages on extremely viral Facebook claims about contaminated food, and pork dripping pus is, as Yancey again noted, guaranteed “clicks and shares and fame for the originator.”Another element to the posts beyond their morbid fascination is the underlying question of whether you can get cancer by eating meat from an animal with cancer. That question is itself part of a larger question about whether cancer is contagious. As it applies to the possibility of eating cancerous-infected animals and subsequently developing cancer, the answer is “that’s not how it works“:In general, no. Cancer is not a contagious disease that easily spreads from person to person. The only situation in which cancer can spread from one person to another is in the case of organ or tissue transplantation. A person who receives an organ or tissue from a donor who had cancer in the past may be at increased risk of developing a transplant-related cancer in the future. However, that risk is extremely low—about two cases of cancer per 10,000 organ transplants. Doctors avoid the use of organs or tissue from donors who have a history of cancer.Finally, as LeadStories noted in a post about the rumor, the viral article falsely claimed there is “no legal obligation for the butchers to give information about cancers in the meant to the customers.” In actuality, animals found to be ill by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service “are not allowed to be slaughtered and are humanely euthanized.”This particular rumor may have been resurrected and driven by an April 2019 announcement from the Trump administration that regulations for the pork industry would be changing effective November 2019, limiting oversight and allowing the industry to monitor itself:Really big plants commonly have seven government inspectors working the hog line. One looks at the whole pig carcass, three look at the heads, and the last three are looking at everything else.So here’s what the Trump administration is changing, starting in November:The regulatory change has roiled public health watchdogs, who claim the changes give meat companies too much authority and not enough oversight. They claim the industry will easily be able to cut corners, which will ultimately expose the public to more foodborne pathogens.There’s quite a bit to recap about the two articles titled “An Experienced Butcher Admits: “When We See Cancer In The Pork, We Just Cut It And Still Sell It To Customers,” one of which appeared to have been shared nearly a million times on Facebook. The “experienced butcher” in question was just a random Twitter user who claimed to have worked in a supermarket; he did not claim to have been a butcher. Images published with the articles came from random Reddit threads. Meat processors and butchers do in fact have a legal obligation not to process or sell meat from diseased animals, and protocol for finding disease includes discarding the entire animal and disinfecting all equipment. Contradicting the rumor also is a large dearth of similar images. And finally, grossness aside, you can’t become infected with cancer by eating meat from a sick animal — but the USDA still prohibits the slaughter and sale of diseased meat.",false,"Disinformation, Fact Checks"
1108,2338,Haitian orphan gets nation's first 3-D printer prosthesis.,"May 12, 2014","A 12-year-old orphan boy handicapped from birth became the first recipient of a 3-D printer prosthesis in Haiti last month, thanks to a British-born software engineer in California.",Amelie Baron,"Born without fingers on either hand, Stevenson Joseph had little hope of treatment in a country where programs for the disabled are rare apart from a handful of charities. Now the 3-D prosthesis fitted to his left hand has given him a whole new range of dexterity, including being able to play catch with his friends for the first time and maybe even enabling him to write one day, according to staff at the home for disabled orphans where he lives. In 2010, Stevenson was brought to Bernard Mevs hospital in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where an orthopedic team was working to fit prosthetic limbs after a devastating earthquake caused injuries that required amputations. “We couldn’t do anything for him here,” recalled Thomas Iwalla, a Kenyan orthopedic technician at hospital. “Some congenital conditions, like Stevenson’s, are pretty hard to tackle. Not even surgery could repair his missing fingers,” he said. On a mission trip to Haiti for Florida-based Food for the Poor last year, John Marshall and his wife Lisa, met Stevenson at the Little Children of Jesus orphanage where he has lived since he was abandoned when he was 3 years old. Back in California, Marshall read an article about Richard van As, a South African man who developed a plastic prosthetic “Robohand” using a 3-D printer after losing his fingers in an woodwork accident in 2011. Marshall and van As worked for months to design a 3-D print prosthesis for the Haitian boy. “Stevenson is handicapped in a small way, in a way that’s not as bad as some of the other children, yet his hands are holding him back. He can do so much more. He has the potential,” said Marshall. After three attempts, the skeleton-looking prosthesis was ready and shipped to Haiti where Bernard Mevs hospital medical team fit Stevenson with it last month. “A printed prosthesis is more anatomical and it allows more motion than the one that is usually custom-made,” said Iwalla, an orthopedic technician at the hospital. Also, once the model is designed, printing the prosthesis cost only around $300. “Some patients care more about cosmetics. But for Stevenson function is the most important criteria. That’s what is in his mind. His robot-hand makes him happy, makes us happy,” said Iwalla. Instead of shooting ink to print words or images in a page, 3-D printers use plastic or metal to build three-dimensional objects ranging from jewelry to guns. Stevenson now spends his days getting used to his new hand. “It is a great hand,” he smiled, ticking off his list of accomplishments. “Now I can take a balloon with it. I can score at basketball. I can hold a TV remote and push my friends on their wheelchairs. I can hold a water bottle, a bag. I like it a lot.”  The 3-D device, articulated by Stevenson’s wrist, makes a slight creaking plastic sound when moving. “Some say that now he looks like a robot, but Stevenson doesn’t care,” said Edouard Williamson, one of the staff at the orphanage.",true,Science News
1109,9272,Asthma pill could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers,"August 11, 2016","This release explains the results of a small clinical trial testing whether the use of a new drug, fevipiprant, would be effective in reducing the serious symptoms of asthma. It does a good job of reporting data on the primary goal of the research and then slips when suggesting the research had other positive outcomes but fails to provide any data backing that up. The release is further weakened by its inclusion of what is basically a testimonial for the new drug by one of the participants in the study. And it fails to mention either costs or possible harms from using the drug, and ignores some rather substantial conflicts of interest among the investigators. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute says more than 22 million Americans have asthma, including about 6 million children. There are many more millions with the condition worldwide. A daily pill that might alleviate serious symptoms of the disease, or even prevent asthma attacks, would be a boon to public health, especially considering some of the shortcomings of other current treatments. New medications to treat the underlying problem, namely airway inflammation, are needed and would translate into improved health for this very common and sometimes serious medical problem. This release may have helped spawn two news stories that we also reviewed that had glaringly different story framing. One was by Reuters and the other by Medical Daily. The latter of the two didn’t offer “anything beyond what is in the news release,” according to reviewers.","Earle Holland,Kathleen Fairfield, MD, DrPH,Kathlyn Stone","The release does not mention the cost of the potential new drug, nor is there any estimate of what the cost might be in comparison to other asthma treatments currently in use including inhalers and corticosteroids. The release would have been more helpful to people with asthma if it had included some cost estimates since new medications tend to be very expensive. If it’s not too early to promote a treatment to a patient audience, it’s not too early to provide a ballpark cost. If this release would have only discussed the primary outcome goal of the study — “to examine the effects on inflammation in the airway by measuring the sputum eosinophil count” — then we’d probably give it a satisfactory rating on this category since it provided clear numerical data showing a significant reduction in percentages among patients taking the drug versus those on placebo. But the release didn’t stop there. It had the principle investigator add glowingly, “A unique feature of this study was how it included measurements of symptoms, lung function using breathing tests, sampling of the airway wall and CT scans of the chest to give a complete picture of how the new drug works.” If these additional measurements were so significant in the study, then why was that data excluded from the release? We need quantification of the actual results of the clinical tests to be able to judge benefits. It’s particularly important to note side effects associated with new medications but the release makes no mention of any harms arising from the drug’s use in the study. However, the full research paper (which unfortunately is behind a paywall) includes a table of adverse events experienced by both the experimental group and patients receiving a placebo that include problems such as infections, respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal and nervous system disorders. While these may ultimately have been minor problems, they deserve mentioning. This release does a good job of explaining the nature of the research and the resulting data (as far as the sputum eosinophil count data goes). As mentioned above, it falls short in providing other indicators which would have strengthened it considerably. But readers are given a clear idea of the degree of improvement the drug provides to patients in terms of the reduction of eosinophil in sputum, compared to those receiving only a placebo. The release verges on disease mongering given some of the exuberant language, particularly from the patient testimonial, but it stops short by noting how many asthma suffers there are in the UK. Asthma is a common and often-serious health problem so giving some context was beneficial. The release gets credit for including the funding sources of the study — Novartis Pharmaceuticals, the National Institute for Health Research in the UK, and the European Union — but it fails to point out any of the linkages among the study’s authors to pharmaceutical firms. According to the published study disclosures, these relationships include speaking fees, consultancies, grants and full-time employment with Novartis and other companies. This transparency is needed for readers to ascertain bias. The release makes no mention of alternative treatments for asthma. There is no comparison with current approaches such as inhalers and corticosteroids or any other approaches regarding this illness. There are a variety of established treatments that are used according to standard protocols depending on asthma severity. The release is fairly clear in pointing out that this was a clinical trial and that the drug, fevipiprant, isn’t available to the public as of yet. The release claims novelty with the statement, “The first new asthma pill for nearly 20 years has the power to significantly reduce the severity of the condition.” That’s not correct. In recent years, several new drugs known as leukotriene receptor antagonists have come on the market in the U.S. as tablets. The release gets credit for having a conservative headline — “Asthma pill could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers” — but then loses it when it allows the main researcher to proclaim, “This new drug could be a game changer for future treatment of asthma.”  Then it follows that up with what basically is a testimonial from one of the participants in the study who says, “I felt like a completely different person” after taking the drug, adding, “For me, it felt like a complete wonder drug and I can’t wait for it to be available because I really think it could make a huge difference to me.”  She closes by saying that after stopping taking the drug, her health started to “go downhill again very quickly.”  Her comments may be factual and might fit well in marketing advertising but they have no place in a news release explaining new health research. Interestingly, the University had also issued a second release related to the same research but not linked in the original release, that offered commentary from two unaffiliated experts. One offered that “The data strongly support further studies,” while the other said, “More research is needed and we’re a long way off seeing a pill for asthma being made available over the pharmacy counter.”  Both comments would have improved the value of the initial release, had they been included.",false,"asthma,University of Leicester"
1112,2580,Nobel winner and organ transplant pioneer Joseph Murray dies at 93.,"November 27, 2012","Dr. Joseph Murray, the surgeon who carried out the first successful kidney transplant and later won a Nobel Prize for his work in medicine and physiology, died on Monday in Boston at the age of 93.",Mary Slosson,"Murray died after suffering a stroke last Thursday, Brigham and Women’s Hospital spokesman Tom Langford said. Murray and his team completed the first human organ transplant in 1954, taking a kidney from one identical twin and giving it to his twin brother, opening a new field in medicine, the hospital said. “The world is a better place because of all Dr. Murray has given. His legacy will forever endure in our hearts and in every patient who has received the gift of life through transplantation,” hospital president Dr. Elizabeth Nabel said in a statement. Later in his career, Murray continued to search for ways of suppressing a patient’s immune response to prevent it from rejecting foreign tissue, eventually becoming a co-winner of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1990. “Difficulties are opportunities. This is a quote that sits atop my father’s desk at home. It reflects the unwavering optimism of a great man who was generous, curious, and always humble,” his son Rick said in a statement. Murray began a career in medicine on graduating from Harvard Medical School in the 1940s, and developed an interest in transplanting tissue while working with service personnel injured in World War Two, according to the Britannica Online Encyclopedia. He completed his surgical training at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and later returned to join the staff and serve as chief of plastic surgery.

1113,24566,"All the really great programs in American history, Social Security, was done without Republicans. Medicare was done without Republican support until the last vote where they realized they had to get on board.","August 28, 2009",Dean claims Social Security and Medicare were passed without Republican support,Catharine Richert,"With virtually no Republican support for the health care reform bill, some Democrats believe they will have to go it alone. But Howard Dean, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, isn't worried about the political repercussions. When asked about the risks of abandoning efforts for a bipartisan bill, Dean had this to say:   ""All the really great programs in American history, Social Security, was done without Republicans. Medicare was done without Republican support until the last vote where they realized they had to get on board,"" Dean said on the Aug. 25, 2009, episode of  The Rachel Maddow Show  . ""So a lot of the things that have been done that have helped seniors in particular have been done without Republican support at all and there's not going to be any political penalty. The only political penalty will be suffered is if we don't pass a bill and the Republicans know that. And that's why they're not interested in helping pass the bill."" Our recollection about the votes on Social Security and Medicare was a little rusty, and we wondered whether Dean was right that both bills passed with no Republican support. To find out, we had to turn back the clock to 1935 — the height of the Great Depression — when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, an insurance program funded through taxpayer dollars meant to support retirees. The legislation was controversial for a number of reasons, including its perceived effects on the labor market and whether its benefits favored working white men. Nevertheless, on Aug. 8, 1935, the conference report — the final version of the bill that melds together changes made in the House and in the Senate — passed in the House 372-33, with 81 Republicans voting in support. The next day, the bill was passed in the Senate 77-6, with 16 Republicans supporting the legislation. So Social Security did pass with Republican support. Thirty years later, a significant number of Republicans voted in favor of the Medicare bill. The House adopted the conference report on July 27, 1965, 307-116, with 70 Republicans supporting it. And on July 28, the Senate adopted the final version of the bill by a vote of 70-24, with 13 Republicans in favor of the bill. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Medicare bill into law on July 30, 1965. But is Dean correct that the Republicans didn't support Medicare until the end? Donald Ritchie, the associate historian in the U.S. Senate, told us that the Republican support wasn't just a last-minute phenomenon. During the discussion of both bills, ""There were always progressive Republicans and liberal Republicans, some of whom supported Roosevelt and Johnson,"" Ritchie said. Johnson had the political muscle to pass Medicare because the 1964 elections ushered in 42 new Democrats to the House of Representatives, giving the party a two-thirds majority overall and a larger majority on the Ways and Means Committee, where the legislation would originate. Up until then, many members of the committee, including its Democratic chairman, Wilbur D. Mills, opposed the idea of government-funded health care. In fact, Mills proved a tough sell in 1965 until some of his own pet proposals were added to the legislation. One of those — the addition of a voluntary, supplemental health care plan — had its roots in a Republican alternative bill. In the House, no Republicans voted for the bill until it reached the floor. It passed the Ways and Means Committee by a party-line vote of 17-8, although the panel's GOP members endorsed some of the bill's non-health care related provisions, according to the 1965  Congressional Quarterly Almanac  . Likewise, all four Republicans on the House Rules Committee — the panel that sets the boundaries of debate on all bills that come to the House floor — voted against the bill. In the Senate, however, there was Republican support in the Finance Committee. When the panel cast its final vote, the bill passed 12-5, with four of the committee's eight Republicans supporting it. (President Barack Obama would probably love to get even that much GOP backing.) So we find Dean is glossing over the details and exaggerating the partisan split. Both Social Security and Medicare were indeed championed by Democrats, but passed with the help of Republican votes. And while some GOP members waited until the last minute to support Medicare, it was backed by half the Republicans on the Senate committee. So we find Dean's statement .",false,"National, Health Care, History, Medicare, Howard Dean, "
1114,8919,Washington state man who traveled to China is first U.S. victim of coronavirus.,"January 21, 2020","A Washington state man who recently traveled to China has been diagnosed with the coronavirus, becoming the first confirmed U.S. case of the newly identified illness that has killed six people in China and sickened some 300 others across Asia.","Julie Steenhuysen, Dan Whitcomb","The patient, identified only as a man in his 30s, fell ill over the weekend after traveling to his hometown in China and was diagnosed with the coronavirus on Monday, Washington Governor Jay Inslee told reporters at a press conference in Seattle. “This is not a moment of high anxiety,” Inslee said, reporting that the man was listed in satisfactory condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington and not known to have infected anyone else. “This is a low risk. It appears to have a transmission vector that really should not prevent anyone from going anywhere in Snohomish County, except maybe the isolation ward at the hospital,” Inslee said. The coronavirus, which causes respiratory symptoms similar to a cold or flu, has been linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, the largest city in central China with a population of about 11 million. That market has since been shut down. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Washington State say the agency is preparing for more U.S. cases of the coronavirus to emerge, and the CDC raised its travel alert for Wuhan to a level 2, calling for enhanced precautions. Under that alert level, the CDC recommends travelers to Wuhan should avoid contact with sick people, animals or animal markets. At the Seattle press conference, CDC Medical Officer Satish Pillai said that all travelers from Wuhan would be directed to five U.S. airports - in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Atlanta and San Francisco - for screening. CDC officials said they have begun tracking down individuals who came in contact with the patient, who lives alone, to check them for symptoms, but so far have not found any additional patients. Besides the United States, cases outside of China have been reported in South Korea, Thailand and Japan. “I don’t think looking at what we know so far that this it on the scale of SARS and MERS, the two most significant coronavirus outbreaks that we know from history,” Dr. Amesh Adalja, from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said in a phone interview with Reuters. “It is early days in this outbreak and we don’t have a good handle on the severity of illness,” Adalja added. The CDC said it has screened more than 1,200 passengers since Jan. 17. None of them have been sent on for additional testing. The U.S. traveler from Washington state had returned on Jan. 15, arriving at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which is not on the U.S. list for enhanced screening. The patient sought care at a medical facility in Everett, Washington, and was treated for the illness. Based on his travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected the new coronavirus. Specimens were taken from the patient and sent to the CDC for testing. The agency said it has developed a new test that allowed it to identify the presence of the virus in a traveler. As is often the case, preliminary information suggests  older adults with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk of severe disease, according to the CDC. The agency is working with health officials in China and globally to better understand the virus and any potential treatments, but U.S. officials have said it could take at least a year of testing before any vaccine could be used on the public.",true,Health News

The statement is false and ridiculous. You can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel's web site.",Tom Kertscher,"After their father and five other worshippers were shot to death on Aug. 5, 2012 at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis., brothers Amar and Pardeep Kaleka became active with Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Pardeep said in a video for the national group, of which the Oak Creek and Milwaukee mayors are members, that 34 Americans are murdered with guns every day. Ten months later, Amar (also known as Amardeep) stepped into an even more public role, announcing plans to run in 2014 against eight-term U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate. Kaleka, a 35-year-old Democrat and documentary filmmaker, was interviewed about his planned candidacy on the Oct. 20, 2013 edition of ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" a public affairs program on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee. When Gousha asked Kaleka what he would say to people who might view him as a one-dimensional candidate focused on guns, Kaleka turned the conversation to the economy. ""I mean, gun legislation is just one of the many things that are holding us down economically. A number of other things, immigration reform, the economic disparity that we’re experiencing, has to do with our thoughts and models that we’ve had in place for now, well over two decades,"" he said. ""I mean, the Midwest is a great example of how we’re losing so many factories and manufacturing jobs and agricultural jobs. For example, we used to be called America's Dairyland. Now, California is called America's Dairyland. We sent them fresh water, and we sold it to them. Ultimately, we didn't get anything in exchange. We lost a bunch of jobs, a bunch of farmland."" It’s been two decades since California eclipsed Wisconsin in milk production, although Wisconsin still calls itself America’s Dairyland. But we’ve never heard that Wisconsin had sold fresh water to California to boost their dairy industry -- and lost jobs and farmland in the process. Wouldn’t there have been a titanic hue and cry if that had ever happened? Big ideas To be sure, there have been some grandiose proposals to sell Great Lakes water to faraway places. In 1998, a Canadian company actually obtained a permit from Ontario to ship fresh water by tankers from Lake Superior to Asia. But after a backlash in Canada and the United States, the permit was canceled two weeks later. In 2007, Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Richardson raised the possibility of exporting Great Lakes water to the Southwest, calling for a national water policy and saying ""states like Wisconsin are awash in water."" But less than two weeks after Richardson’s comments rattled Midwest politicians, his campaign issued a statement saying Richardson ""in no way proposes federal transfers of water from one region of the nation to the other."" The following year, the eight Great Lakes states reached agreement on the Great Lakes Compact, which bans Great Lakes water from being ""diverted,"" or piped out of the basin, with a few exceptions, such as the possible sale of Lake Michigan water from Oak Creek to another Milwaukee suburb, Waukesha, which is under consideration. Even then, Waukesha would have to return 100 percent of the water by volume to the lake by discharging treated wastewater to the Root River in Franklin. Even with the compact, officials remain wary of outsiders coveting Great Lakes water, said Tim Eder, executive director of the Great Lakes Commission, an interstate agency that promotes the development, use and conservation of water in the Great Lakes basin. So, was there a Wisconsin sale of fresh water to California before the 2008 compact? ""No way. It's really simple,"" Eder said of Kaleka’s claim. ""He’s wrong. I don’t know where he’s getting his information, but it’s not based in fact."" Two other experts -- Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources water use section chief Eric Ebersberger, and Peter Annin, managing director of the University of Notre Dame Environmental Change Initiative, which does research on water resources -- were also dumbfounded and emphatic: No water sale to California has ever occurred. And if it never occurred, it certainly didn’t boost the dairy industry there, or mean lost jobs or farmland here. Indeed, federal figures show that in 2012, Wisconsin produced 27.2 billion pounds of milk, a record for the state, and led the nation by producing 2.79 billion pounds of cheese. Said Annin, author of ""The Great Lakes Water Wars"": ""I’m not aware of any instance where the State of Wisconsin, or anybody in the state of Wisconsin, sold water to California. There’ve been a lot of weird proposals, but they’ve never actually happened."" We also checked with the federal Mississippi River Commission, which assured us that water from the Mississippi River was never sold to California. Kaleka, meanwhile, told us he meant to say ""we thought about sending them fresh water."" He added: ""I'm going to have to take my hit on this. It was a sloppy response to a very big problem of local and national economics."" But on even that he is off. None of the information Kaleka provided us indicates that Wisconsin even considered selling water to California. And we could find no record of it. Our rating Kaleka said Wisconsin sold fresh water to California and ""lost a bunch of jobs (and) a bunch of farmland.""

1118,9100,New recommendations for managing menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors,"August 28, 2017","This news release lists several non-pharmalogical steps for relieving menopausal symptoms of women who have been treated for breast cancer. The main takeaway is that most women who have been treated for breast cancer shouldn’t receive hormone therapy, but instead focus on lifestyle changes although some emerging pharmacologic approaches were listed as well. It’s not clear from either the news release or the published study how researchers drew their conclusions. The release states that clinical trials, observational studies, guidelines, and expert opinion were analyzed, but no study data is provided to put the findings in perspective. Women who are dealing with premature menopause as a result of breast cancer treatment would benefit from a better understanding of risks and benefits of treatments. The news release states that there are 9.3 million breast cancer survivors worldwide but doesn’t note, as the study does, that 43 percent of these are older than 65 at diagnosis and thus would not have menopausal symptoms due to chemotherapy for their breast cancer. The study also notes that 25 percent of those diagnosed are below age 50 and are thus more likely to be pre-menopausal at diagnosis. By not including those breakdowns the news release makes chemotherapy-induced menopause seem more prevalent than it is.","Mandy Stahre, PhD,Christine K. Norton, MA,Kathlyn Stone","The report lists a variety of methods for reducing menopausal symptoms, but no costs associated with any of the methods are mentioned. Many of the recommended methods — like cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis and acupuncture — may not be covered by insurance or even available to many women depending on their location. No numerical context is given in the news release showing how lifestyle modifications might benefit breast cancer survivors with menopausal symptoms. For example, did any of the studies find an association between smoking cessation and reduced hot flashes or nighttime sweating? A breast cancer diagnosis may be incentive for women to make healthy lifestyle changes. Knowing the benefits of each of the lifestyle modifications mentioned would help women decide which change they would like to make. No harms were mentioned in the release. The only nod to harms was the recommendation that women who were treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer should not be treated with hormone therapy. The news release mentions that the results were based on a comprehensive review of “controlled clinical trials, observational studies, evidence-based guidelines, and expert opinion from professional societies.” Unfortunately, in neither the release or the original article is there a description of the criteria used to determine which articles were used in the review. Before the quality of evidence can be assessed we need to know some basics: How many women were included in the studies? How long were the studies? What were some limitations? The review did not commit disease mongering. However, by omitting the breakdown of breast cancer survivors by age the release might give the impression that chemotherapy-induced menopause symptoms are higher than they actually are. As noted above, the study states that 43 percent of these women are older than 65 at diagnosis and would not have chemotherapy induced menopausal symptoms. The release doesn’t state any funding sources. Several of the review authors have received industry funding and any relevant industry funding should be noted in the release. The release lists things women should do to help relieve menopausal symptoms, but there are no comparisons of which ones may be more beneficial. Knowing which ones offered the strongest benefits would help women decide on which approaches to follow. It’s unrealistic to suggest that all women would be willing or able to make all of the modifications recommended. We’ve all heard these messages throughout our lives. A cancer diagnosis may be the incentive needed to make changes but women deserve to know which changes have the potential for the greatest  benefit. Although lifestyle changes are readily available, it’s unclear if the emerging approaches (“selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), Tissue selective estrogen complex (TSECs), estetrol, and neurokinin B inhibitors”) listed in the release are even available. Some of the recommended lifestyle changes aren’t available to women with limited access to healthy foods which are often more costly even if they are available. Lack of insurance coverage and lack of availability of alternative treatments like cognitive behavior therapy, acupuncture and hypnosis put these modifications out of reach for many women. Besides listing lifestyle approaches which are not novel, it’s unclear if the emerging approaches listed are novel.

Obesity rates have sky-rocketed in the last 20 years. More than one third of adults in the United States are obese, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Bryant said the health crisis is strongly linked to the lifestyle choices that fitness professionals, such as personal trainers and group fitness instructors, address. Despite the shaky economy, health club membership is up more than 10 percent over the past three years, according to IHRSA, the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association. Exercise physiologist and ACE spokesperson Jessica Matthews said workplace wellness campaigns also increase demand for fitness professionals. Bryant said the average salary for a certified personal trainer is about $53,000 and rising. A high school diploma is sufficient to begin a career in fitness, he added, although more than two-thirds of professionals have college degrees. Matthews said the industry attracts career changers driven by the downturn to reinvent their working selves. “In the last few years people have been coming from all different industries,” said Matthews, who has worked in fitness for 12 years. While you don’t need college to enter the field, she said, continuing education is a must to remain in it. “It’s accessible, but it involves a great commitment,” she explained. “There’s the preparation and study for the exam, and then the requirement of continuing education to stay current.”  Bryant said the individual must re-certify every two years. Matthews, who is qualified in group fitness, personal training and yoga, said the most successful trainers are the constant learners. The obesity epidemic is the United States is also a contributing factor. “There’s a huge push from the weight standpoint,” she said. “Most people come to fitness professionals with weight goals.”  Bryant said the profession is about more than aesthetics: it’s about making a connection with the client. “It’s called personal training for a reason,” Matthews explained. “You’re an educator, a motivator, someone who holds them (clients) accountable. You coach individuals. At the end of the day it’s customer service.”  Husband-and-wife team Phil and Michelle Dozois opened their mom-and-pop gym, BreakthruFitness, in Pasadena, California, just as the economy was tipping into free fall. “We opened in 2009, pretty much when the economy fell apart, said Phil Dozois. “We had both been working in gyms for 15 years, me as trainer, my wife as group exercise instructor.”  The Dozois envisioned and created a club where people buy only what they need. Dozois said his programs range from eight-week weight loss to total conditioning. “People will pay more money for it if there’s a start-finish,” he said. “For us it’s been really successful financially.”  When he hires a new fitness professional, Dozois said he looks for a person with a pleasing personality who is open to learning. “They don’t have to be fit, as long as they’re on the path to fitness. I believe they should walk the walk,” he said. (This story was refiled to correct the spelling of Dozoirs to Dozois throughout)",true,Health News

The much-maligned group is regularly depicted as the enemy of the Israelites in Biblical texts. The giant Goliath was a Philistine. So was Delilah who entrapped legendary warrior Samson. Thanks to their bad press, their name has also become synonymous with crassness, ignorance and hostility to culture. But for all their prominence, where they came from before settling the coast of what is now southern Israel and Gaza remained a mystery. Varying theories had asserted their ancestors originated in the Aegean, or the northern Levant or that they were actually a local culture. “Our study has shown for the first time that the Philistines immigrated to this region in the 12th century (BC),” said Daniel Master, director of the Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon, a coastal city where the first ever Philistine cemetery was found. “We didn’t show it by showing similar styles of pottery, we didn’t show it by looking at texts, we showed it by looking at the DNA of the people themselves,” Master said. “We can see at Ashkelon new DNA coming in from this immigrant population that is really changing the whole region.”  The Ashkelon team sent more than 100 skeletal samples to Germany’s Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. DNA was found in ten individuals, particularly in the inner ear bones that preserved it over the millennia. The findings, published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, showed three stages: pre-migration, migration, and then a dilution of the genetic footprint within the local population a couple hundred years later. Although the genetic modeling suggests southern Europe as the area of origin, there are some limitations to 3,000-year-old DNA testing, said Michal Feldman, an archaeo-geneticist who worked on the study at Max Planck. “This ancestral component is derived from Europe, or to be more specific, from southern Europe, so the ancestors of the Philistines must have traveled across the Mediterranean and arrived in Ashkelon sometime between the end of the Bronze age and the beginning of the Iron age,” Feldman said. “There would be a lot more that we can say if we had more data, for example we could maybe more precisely pinpoint the source of this migration,” she said. Earlier work by the Ashkelon team has suggested the Philistines were actually no ""philistines"". Excavations of a 3,000-year-old cemetery in 2016 found bodies buried with jewelry and perfumed oil.

Meatless Monday is pretty self-explanatory; it’s an awareness campaign that encourages people to abstain once weekly from eating meat. The program was born in 2003 as a health initiative out of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health with stated goals of improving people’s health and lowering fuel and water costs of food production by encouraging lower meat consumption. It has since spread to participants that include hundreds of schools, universities and restaurants in 24 countries. But the arrival of the Baltimore-based program at three elementary schools in the Dripping Springs Independent School District made Staples ""very concerned,"" he said in a Sept. 8, 2014, commentary in the Austin American-Statesman. For Staples, excluding meat is not just a matter of taste – it’s a blow to daily nutrition, especially if students are not well nourished at home. ""It is important to remember that for many underprivileged children the meals they eat at school often represent their best meals of the day. To deprive them of a meat-based protein during school lunch is most likely depriving them of their only source of protein for the day,"" Staples wrote. Was Staples right about kids getting shorted? Let’s look at the meals that drew his ire, then explore if affected children are not getting needed proteins. Warning: Flames ahead. Dining options on a Meatless Monday Generally in Dripping Springs, lunching students may select up to one meat/meat alternate, three fruit or vegetable dishes and one grain or milk dish. If a child forgoes a meat/meat alternate, he or she is allowed four fruit or vegetable dishes. A student must take a minimum of three dishes with at least one serving of fruit or vegetable. On any day, of course, there's a chance a child won't choose to eat any protein dishes. The lunch menu at Dripping Springs Elementary, which participates in Meatless Mondays, runs on a three-week cycle. On the first Monday, when meat is not an option, the school offers vegetarian chili with cornbread, grilled cheese sandwiches, assorted vegetarian soups, cheese nachos, a baked potato with fixings, ""healthy"" refried beans, crunchy vegetable dippers and chilled pears or fresh fruit. On the second Monday of the school’s cycle, the menu includes cheese ravioli, vegetarian chili, cornbread, mozzarella sticks with marinara, a baked potato with fixings, spinach salad, green beans, apple sauce and fresh fruit. On the third Monday, the cafeteria offers black bean burritos, bean and cheese burritos, vegetarian chili, corn bread, cheese nachos, a baked potato with fixings, ""healthy"" refried beans, ""carrot babies"" with ranch, chilled sliced peaches and fresh fruit.

While an extraordinarily large dog or a cat with an unusually long tail may be regarded as nothing more than a momentarily interesting curiosity or a source of amusement, people who exhibit one of the extremes in human development — whether it be in intelligence, height, weight, or some other feature — have long struggled to avoid being identified as “freaks.” Perhaps the most discomfiting record of this nature involves the youngest person ever to give birth, reputedly a five-year-old girl — not only because such a record posits that a child barely of kindergarten age involuntarily underwent an experience we associate with physical and psychological maturity, but also because it implies the commission of an act now considered to be nothing less than child molestation. Regardless of our squeamishness, we have to note that the claim of a five-year-old girl giving birth is  true. Her name was Lina Medina, a Peruvian girl from the Andean village of Ticrapo who made medical history when she gave birth to a boy by caesarean section in May 1939 at the age of five years, seven months and 21 days. Lina’s parents initially thought their daughter had a large abdominal tumor, but after they took her to a hospital in the town of Pisco physicians confirmed that her abdominal swelling was due to pregnancy. Lina was eventually transferred to a hospital in Lima, where she delivered a six-pound baby boy by Cesarean section on 14 May 1939 (coincidentally the date on which Mother’s Day was celebrated that year). Lina’s father was temporarily jailed on suspicion of incest, but he was released for a lack of evidence and authorities were never able to determine who fathered Lina’s child. Lina’s incredible story was documented in contemporaneous reports by Edmundo Escomel, one of Peru’s preeminent physician-researchers of the period and a laureate of the prestigious French Academy of Sciences. Escomel’s first correspondence to the editors of La Presse Medicale1 (which is undated but appeared in the 13 May 1939 issue) noted that Lina first came to the attention of Dr. Gérado Lozada, chief physician of the Hospital of Pisco, when she appeared at that hospital in early April 1939 for evaluation of what was assumed to be a massive abdominal tumor. It soon became obvious to the stunned Lozada, however, that the little girl was pregnant. A medical history revealed that she had been having regular periods since age 3, but that she had stopped menstruating for the past 7½ months. Additionally, she had fully developed breasts. Further examination revealed a fetal heartbeat, and an X-ray confirmed the pregnancy. Escomel stated that Lozada had submitted a report about the case to the Academy of Medicine in Lima. Escomel’s announcement2 (dated 20 May 1939) that Lina had delivered a baby boy (on 14 May) appeared in the 31 May issue of La Presse Medicale. In addition to amending the age at which Lina began menstruating (to an incredible 8 months), Escomel submitted a photograph of the gravid 5½-year-old:  At the end of his piece Escomel noted with some sadness that no one had yet discovered the identity of the father since Lina “couldn’t give precise responses.” He also stressed the importance of getting adequate care for the little girl. Escomel’s final report3 was published in the 19 December 1939 issue of La Presse Medicale. He commented on a biopsy of one of Lina’s ovaries performed on a sample removed at the time of the Cesarean section and provided photomicrographs of the stained tissue sections. In the end, pathologists pronounced Lina to have the ovaries of a fully mature woman. Escomel posited that the reason behind her precocious fertility could not lie in the ovaries themselves but must have stemmed from an extraordinary hormonal disorder of pituitary origin. (As a point of comparison, the average age of first menstruation in the U.S. is 12½.) The U.S. press was also interested in this curious and disturbing story. A United Press report published in the Los Angeles Times on 16 May 1939 noted:  Dr. Hipolito Larrabure, head of the maternity hospital, who aided Dr. [Geraldo] Lozada [director of the Pisco Hospital] during the [Cesarean] operation, said Lina withstood the operation in excellent manner. Medical circles here were astonished at the birth, which they believed without precedent. Dr. Larrabure said the case was “truly astounding” and added that he hoped “some United States scientific foundation will send an investigator to Lima to observe the case and indicate the best manner of caring for the mother and child.”4  The Los Angeles Times also reported their own confirmation of the story that same day:  The possibility of a girl becoming a mother at the age of 5, as reported on Sunday from Lima, Peru, was upheld today by Dr. Joseph B. De Lee, obstetrics authority of Chicago Lying-in Hospital.Dr. De Lee cited the case of a Russian girl who became a mother at the age of 6½. According to the physician who reported the case in a German medical journal, Dr. De Lee said, the mother had the physical development of a girl 10 or 12 years old.5  Six months later, the New York Times reported that an American public health official had verified Lina’s remarkable story:  While in Lima Dr. [S.L. Christian, assistant surgeon general of the U.S. Public Health Service] examined Lina Medina, the Indian child-mother whose baby was born last May when the mother was about 5 years old. He said that although there was some confusion as to whether the mother was 5 or 6, there was no doubt of the authenticity of the case, which he described as the most amazing thing in his career as a physician.6  The following year the New York Times reported in a follow-up article that a trip was being organized so Lina could be “brought to the United States within a month for examination by a five-man medical commission.” Plans called for the little mother, the baby boy, and the girl’s parents to travel to Chicago, but there was no follow-up indicating that the Medina family ever made the journey to the U.S.7 In 1941, two years after Lina give birth, the New York Times published an account of an American psychologist who had examined Lina while visiting South America:  Another passenger [on the liner Santa Clara, which was returning from South America] was Mrs. Paul Kosak, specialist in child education at Teachers College, Columbia University. Mrs. Kosak is the only child psychologist who has been permitted to make studies of Lina Medina, the Peruvian girl who, two years ago, gave birth to a child at the age of 5 years.Mrs. Kosak said she gave a series of intelligence tests to the child and that on the basis of this study she has no doubt the child’s age was given correctly. “Lina is above normal in intelligence and the baby, a boy, is perfectly normal and is physically better developed than the average Mestiza (Spanish Indian) child,” she said. “She thinks of the child as a baby brother and so does the rest of the family.”8  Jose Sandoval, an obstetrician who took an interest in Lina Medina’s case and authored a book about her in 2002 said that Lina was a psychologically normal child, that she displayed no other unusual medical symptoms, and that she preferred playing with dolls rather than her own child.",true,Medical
1134,32411,Marijuana dealers are using the popular game app Pokémon GO to hook children on drugs.,"August 10, 2016","The number of people missing after California’s deadliest and most destructive wildfire jumped on Saturday to 1,276, despite authorities locating hundreds of people who scattered when the Camp Fire tore through the mountain town of Paradise.",Bethania Palma,"Forensic recovery teams sifting through the charred wreckage recovered the remains of five more victims, bringing the death toll to at least 76, authorities said. Sixty-three of them have been tentatively identified, pending DNA confirmation. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said much of the increase in the number of missing was due to his office’s efforts to comb through a backlog of emergency calls that came in during the first hours of the fire on Nov. 8. He said officials were sifting through the list of missing persons for duplications and people who fled. Some 380 people had been located and taken off the list since Friday, he said. “A lot of progress is being made with regard to that, but this is still raw data,” Honea told a news conference. The sheriff spoke after President Donald Trump visited Paradise, the small community that was home to nearly 27,000 people in the Sierra foothills, 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco, before being all but consumed by the blaze. “Nobody could have thought this would ever happen,” Trump told reporters amid the charred wreckage of the town’s Skyway Villa Mobile Home and RV Park. “This is very sad to see. As far as the lives are concerned, nobody knows quite yet,” Trump said. “Right now we want to take care of the people who have been so badly hurt.”  Trump was flanked by California Governor Jerry Brown and Governor-elect Gavin Newsom. Brown said the federal government was doing what it needed to do, including supporting first responders and helping with clean-up and search for victims. The disaster already ranks among the deadliest U.S. wildfires since the turn of the last century. Eighty-seven people perished in the Big Burn firestorm that swept the Northern Rockies in August 1910. Minnesota’s Cloquet Fire in October 1918 killed 450 people. Trump has blamed the recent spate of fires on forest mismanagement, and he said he discussed the issue with Brown and Newsom on the ride into Paradise. Asked whether the scenes of devastation had changed his view on climate change, Trump said: “No. I have a strong opinion. I want great climate and we’re going to have that and we’re going to have forests that are very safe.”  Authorities attribute the high death toll from the blaze - dubbed “Camp Fire” - partly to the speed with which flames raced through the town with little warning, driven by howling winds and fueled by drought-desiccated scrub and trees. More than a week later, firefighters have managed to carve containment lines around 55 percent of the blaze’s perimeter. Besides the toll on human life, property losses from the blaze make it the most destructive in California history, posing the additional challenge of providing long-term shelter for many thousands of displaced residents. With more than 12,700 homes and other structures up in smoke, many refugees have taken up temporary residence with friends and family, while others have pitched tents or were living out of their vehicles. Hundreds of evacuees were being housed in 14 emergency shelters set up in churches, schools and community centers around the region, with more than 46,000 people remaining under evacuation orders, authorities said. Several shelters are full and although authorities say they still have space for everyone, hundreds of people have been camping in tents and cars in the area. The names were being compiled from information received from a special hotline, along with email reports and a review of emergency 911 calls that came in on the first night of the fire, Honea said. Some listed have likely survived but not yet notified family or authorities. Others may not have been immediately listed because of delays in reporting them. Honea bristled at a Friday press conference when asked whether many of those listed, more than a week after the disaster, were expected at this point to end up either deceased or declared missing and presumed dead. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for any of us to sit and speculate about what the future holds,” he said. The sheriff on Saturday emphasized that authorities were largely relying on the public’s cooperation to determine who on the list of missing persons is alive. “I want to tell people that it’s really very important for you to take a look at the list and call us if you’re on the list and let us know.”   Weather conditions have since turned more in the firefighters’ favor, though strong, gusty winds and lower humidity were expected through early Sunday ahead of rain forecast for mid-week. The outbreak of Camp Fire coincided with a series of smaller blazes in Southern California, most notably the Woolsey Fire, which is linked to three fatalities near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles. Scientists have said the growing frequency and intensity of wildfires in California and elsewhere across the West are largely attributable to prolonged drought that is symptomatic of climate change. The precise causes of the Camp and Woolsey Fires were under investigation, but electric utilities have reported equipment problems in the vicinity of both blazes around the time they erupted.",false,"Uncategorized, drugs, marijuana, pokemon go"

Authorities are increasing screenings at airports and border crossings, and urging citizens to avoid large crowds. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he would not attend celebrations for the Hindu Holi festival, scheduled to be held across the country next week. “Experts across the world have advised to reduce mass gatherings to avoid the (virus) spread,” Modi said in a tweet on Wednesday. “Hence, this year I have decided not to participate.”  An employee of Paytm - an Indian payments company whose parent firm is backed by Alibaba and SoftBank  - who had vacationed in Italy and is based in Gurugram near New Delhi tested positive for the coronavirus, a spokesperson said late on Wednesday. “We have also advised all our colleagues to work from home for a couple of days while we get our offices sanitized,” the spokesperson said in a statement, adding that daily operations and services would not be impacted. Paytm has six offices around New Delhi, employing more than 3,000 people. An Italian visiting the western desert state of Rajasthan was among those who had tested positive earlier. And on Wednesday, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said 15 of 21 tourists from Italy - Europe’s worst-affected country - who had been taken to a quarantine facility on the outskirts of New Delhi had tested positive for the virus. Their Indian driver was also placed in quarantine. Indian stock markets slid nearly 2% after the government disclosed the rise in cases, before paring losses late in the day. Vardhan said authorities were taking extra precautions against the spread of the virus after the sharp rise in cases. “We will now screen all international passengers. We will not limit our screenings to 12 countries as we did earlier,” Vardhan told a news conference. More than 93,000 cases have been reported worldwide, and several thousand have died from the flu-like coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has since spread to more than 80 countries. India, the world’s largest supplier of generic drugs, has curbed the export of pharmaceuticals due to fears of coronavirus-related shortages and this has caused “panic” in Europe, the head of the country’s top pharmaceuticals export group told Reuters on Wednesday.",true,Health News
1136,9299,New Data Shows Irreversible Electroporation Nearly Doubles Overall Survival of Patients with Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer When Added to Standard Therapy,"April 28, 2015","A futuristic-sounding medical treatment is paired with a bold claim of survival benefit in this news release. But the release is missing basic information to back up the headline’s claims and put the treatment’s efficacy into perspective. And an important conflict of interest is not disclosed. Such omissions could help instill false hope in sufferers of pancreatic cancer and their families. [Editor’s note: At the top of this review, we’ve left blank the area where we’d normally put the logo for the organization that issued this new release. This reflects our uncertainty as to who should be considered the source of this news. As we’ve discussed in a blog post, the release is worded to suggest that it originated with the University of Louisville, and it includes a University of Louisville media contact. However, that contact has told us, via email and a comment on this review, that the release originated with MCS Healthcare Public Relations, which was working with a member of the University of Louisville faculty. That faculty member, in turn, suggested to us that the release was in fact cleared and sanctioned by the University. The University of Louisville media contact has refused to provide any further clarification. We’re unsure whom to believe, so we’ve deliberately left blank the area where we’d normally indicate the news release source. The fact that we can’t even tell where this news came from should raise questions about the process that produced it.] Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer, killing nearly three-quarters of victims within a year of diagnosis and about 94 percent within five years. One reason, according to the CDC, is that nearly 80 percent of patients are diagnosed too late for surgery (which can extend median survival by about 10 months). Thus any treatment shown to be effective in treating the disease–especially a minimally invasive, non-surgical method–could possibly reduce patients’ suffering and provide them significantly more quality time with their loved ones.","Dave Mosher,Doug Campos-Outcalt, MD, MPA,Kevin Lomangino","Costs aren’t discussed, but secondary sources suggest each NanoKnife machine (which can be used over and over again) costs between $200,000–$300,000. The one-use needles, which are used to zap or ablate cancerous pancreatic tissue, cost about $2,000 each–but it’s not said how many sessions are required. Nor is the cost of doctors, hospital stay, etc. discussed. Plus, it’s unknown if insurance will cover this. The release clearly states that nearly three-quarters of pancreatic cancer patients die within a year of diagnosis and 94 percent die within 5 years. It then goes on to say the NanoKnife IRE treatment doubles overall survival to 24 months. But the release never provides the absolute numbers from either the treatment or control group to substantiate this. The percentage of patients alive at 24 months may be higher in one group or the other, but the data are not there to tell. In addition, the release states that existing treatment “will only stabilize the disease and not destroy the tumor,” whereas the new treatment “overcomes rapid growth of the tumor by killing all malignant cells at once so they cannot continue to grow and spread.” But it’s not clear that the new treatment does, in fact, do more than “stabilize the disease” or that the cancer won’t “grow and spread” with the new treatment, since a chart in the abstract suggests that the disease unfortunately remains uniformly fatal even with the new treatment. Harms are alluded to, e.g. “[19] percent sustained complications with a median grade of 2 (range 1-3),” but they’re not discussed or explained in sufficient detail. What’s a “median grade 2” complication? It would have helped this release to cite, for example, the American Cancer Society on the side effects of ablative therapies for pancreatic cancer. Generally, according the ACS, those harms can “include abdominal pain, fever, nausea, infection, and blood clots in nearby blood vessels” with a potential for serious complications. We’re told the study results were “compared to standard of care data for Stage III [locally advanced pancreatic cancer],” but the release doesn’t provide any numbers or context with the control group. There are many factors that can affect cancer survival, and so it’s important to know how these control group patients were selected and whether their disease and treatment were truly comparable to those who received electroporation. But details on that issue are missing. It’s also worth noting that, while a median survival of nearly 2 years sounds promising, there’s a chance this claim might be overstated. Four known variations in pancreatic cancer tissue were recently and significantly shown to predict a pancreatic cancer patient’s survival. Those with three or four of the variations showed a median survival of about 9 months; those with only 1-2 survived about 23 months. Although it’s unlikely most of the 200 patients in the study presented by this release fell into the latter category, it’s just one example of how the benefits aren’t put into context and adequately explained. There’s no exaggeration of pancreatic cancer here. Pancreatic cancer is uniformly fatal with or without this new treatment. At great expense it appears survival might be extended (it is not clear for how long) . Adding the number of people who are diagnosed and/or die from the disease every year in the U.S.–about 49,000 and 40,000, respectively–would have made this release stronger. We aren’t told what the funding sources are, nor whether there’s any conflict of interest. This information is also missing from the abstract itself. But by digging just a little bit, we learned that the lead author of the study and the primary source for this release (Dr. Martin) is a paid consultant to Angiodynamics (scroll to the bottom for disclosure info), which makes the NanoKnife system. This is critical information to disclose with these results. A quote from the lead author mentions the alternatives for pancreatic cancer patients, “whose only treatment options until now were chemotherapy or a combination of chemo-radiation therapy” and that–with the NanoKnife IRE treatment’–“these patients now have a surgical treatment option to augment their treatment plan.” We’re told the NanoKnife system “is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the surgical ablation of soft tissue” and that it “is not approved for use in specific cancers.” So does that mean a pancreatic cancer patient could ask for this treatment? It’s unclear. It’s also unclear if insurance will pay for it. Ablative therapy is not new to pancreatic cancer treatment, but if true, extending 1-year survival to nearly 2 years could be a large and significant improvement. The release asserts the NanoKnife IRE treatment can double the survival for pancreatic cancer patients, but it doesn’t lay out potential caveats, nor how this only applies to the 1-year survival category (and not the 5-year survival category). However, since we’ve already dinged them for that deficiency, and there are no other examples of hyperbole, we’ll call this Satisfactory.",false,"NanoKnife,pancreatic cancer,University of Louisville"

What's false: Nancy Pelosi did not unilaterally declare that Congress would be out of session during a pandemic ""unless there is an emergency.""",David Mikkelson,"In April 2020, as much of the U.S. economy was at a standstill while the federal and state governments scrambled to deal with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, a meme circulated via social media held that U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had declared Congress would be out of session until the following month unless an “emergency” arose:  This meme was a gross distortion of what actually took place, which was not that Pelosi took it upon herself to decide no current emergency required lawmakers’ attention and to adjourn Congress until the following month (a power she does not possess). Rather, bipartisan statements from the majority leaders of both houses of Congress — Republican Mitch McConnell for the Senate and Democrat Steny Hoyer for the House of Representatives — announced that Congress would be extending its current recess by an additional two weeks due to the COVID-19 outbreak, but legislators would continue to work remotely until May 4 unless they needed to return to Washington, D.C., earlier than that to pass emergency measures related to the pandemic. For example, CNBC reported the following of the House Majority Leader’s statement on scheduling: The House will not come back to Washington until at least May 4 unless it needs to pass emergency measures to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer’s office told representatives. The chamber previously expected lawmakers to return on April 20 after an extended absence. House members, most of whom have been in their districts for all of April as Covid-19 spreads, will not have to travel to Washington before May 4 “absent an emergency,” the Maryland Democrat’s office said. It added that lawmakers would get “sufficient notice” if they have to travel to Washington to vote on coronavirus legislation. Similarly, NPR reported the following of the Senate Majority Leader’s statement on scheduling: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the full Senate will not plan to return to the Capitol before May 4 — a delay from a planned return [on April 20]. McConnell said the decision to change the schedule was made “following the advice of health experts” and in consultation with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. McConnell, R-Ky., stressed that Congress continues to work remotely to respond to the economic impact of the coronavirus. “As Senators continue working together from our home states, we must stay totally focused on fighting this pandemic and strengthening our nation. The coronavirus does not take days off and the United States Senate must not either, wherever we are,” McConnell said in a written statement. The move follows a similar announcement a day earlier from House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., informing members the House would not return until May 4. Both leaders indicated that if Congress needed to act quickly on something, members would be given at least 24 hours’ notice. Here is the full announcement issued by U.S. Senate Majority Leader McConnell on April 14, 2020, regarding scheduling: Since the Senate passed the historic CARES Act in late March, Senators have been working around the country to monitor its implementation and help our states and nation attack this pandemic. As the country continues working together to flatten the curve, following the advice of health experts, the full Senate is not expected to travel back to Washington D.C. sooner than Monday, May 4th. All members will receive at least 24 hours’ notice if this changes. This bipartisan decision reflects consultation with Leader Schumer and my colleagues in Senate leadership. As Senators continue working together from our home states, we must stay totally focused on fighting this pandemic and strengthening our nation. The coronavirus does not take days off and the United States Senate must not either, wherever we are. For example, the crucial Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which is literally saving millions of American jobs, will run dry this week if we do not pass more funding. While other CARES Act programs such as hospital funding and assistance for state governments are just beginning to push out money, 70% of the PPP’s funding has been already allotted in just a week and a half. President Trump, Secretary Mnuchin, and Senate and House Republicans simply want to add more funding for this job-saving program that both parties designed together. There is no time to insist on sweeping renegotiations or ultimatums about other policies that passed both houses unanimously. Clean funding for worker pay in a crisis should not be controversial. I hope our Democratic colleagues will let Congress act this week. American workers deserve paychecks, not pink slips caused by political games. And here is the scheduling announcement issued by U.S. House Majority Leader Hoyer: Members are advised that absent an emergency, the House is not expected to meet prior to Monday, May 4, 2020. Members are further advised that if the House is required to take action on critical legislation related to the coronavirus response or other legislative priorities, Members will be given sufficient notice to return to Washington, DC.

1140,8963,Testosterone replacement therapy may slow the progression of COPD,"September 17, 2018","This release summarizes an observational study noting a relationship with two groups of men (middle aged and older), their consumption of testosterone replacement therapy and whether they are hospitalized for respiratory problems. It found that testosterone replacement therapy users had a decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users. While observational studies such as these are useful and hypothesis generating, they do not have the strength of a randomized, blinded trial and hence one cannot conclude that such associations are causal. Better information about the harms, costs and conflicts of interests of the researchers would have made this a better news release. If testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) slows the progression of COPD in men by producing a positive lung function, this could indeed be a public health advance. Observational studies, however, are problematic in that the two cohorts of men observed (those who take TRT and those who don’t) may be different in other fundamental ways. There could, for example, be a “healthy user bias” in that the TRT cohort of men may be naturally healthier at the start, and that any improvements in COPD function may just be a function of their basic overall health. Studies like these allow us to draw conclusions, but only that there is an association — not that TRT caused a reduction in COPD.","Alan Cassels,Saurabh Jha, MBBS,Kathlyn Stone","There was no discussion of costs. The benefits were reported in quantitative terms:  “middle-aged testosterone replacement therapy users had a 4.2 percent greater decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users and older testosterone replacement therapy users had a 9.1 percent greater decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users.”  Even though this suggests that testosterone replacement therapy may slow the progression of disease in men with COPD, one is still left wondering how often that occurs. We aren’t given any baseline numbers so the 4.2% and the 9.1% relative risk numbers lack context. There are known dangers to TRT including raising the risk of prostate cancer but none of the risks are mentioned in the news release. We are told that the study is based on a database of “450 men aged 40 to 63 with COPD who began testosterone replacement therapy between 2005 and 2014,” as well as “253 men with COPD aged 66 and older who initiated testosterone replacement therapy between 2008 and 2013.” It is hard to say whether the size of these study groups are large enough to draw conclusions. As the published study pointed out, the research had several limitations, none of which are pointed out in the news release: The results of our study may have been influenced by several limitations. First, all diagnoses were based on ICD-9-CM codes, which may be inaccurate or incomplete. It is possible that some of the cases we identified may have been based on misclassified data. Second, the pharmacy plans used by both study cohorts did not cover over-the-counter medications. Our database, therefore, did not include information on coadministration of these drugs; some of them, such as n-acetylcysteine, may influence the risk of respiratory outcomes. Third, the claims data used in this study did not permit examination of certain potential confounding factors such as diet, alcohol use, and other health-related behaviors. Fourth, our study cohorts were relatively small and may have lacked adequate statistical power and precision. Finally, our data included the date the prescription was filled but not the date it was obtained by the patient. In view of this, some of the drug exposure periods may have been misclassified. There is no disease mongering here. The release provides context on how many people could be affected globally by COPD. The funders of the study are not named in the release. The lead author, we learn in the full paper, “has received payment, for consulting, from AbbVie, Endo Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, and Auxilium Pharmaceuticals.” Some of these companies manufacture testosterone replacement therapy. This was not mentioned in the news release. There are a range of treatments for COPD, none of which are mentioned in this release. It is pretty obvious that TRT is available to men, so the fact it wasn’t mentioned as available is a moot point. The release notes that there are some previous hypothetical links between TRT and lung function in men and that this is the first “large scale nationally representative study on this association.” There are no examples of egregious and unjustified language here.",false,"COPD,SAGE,testosterone replacement therapy"

Rates of women dying as a result of pregnancy complications were already on the decline when the Supreme Court decided Roe vs. Wade. But experts told us that a primary reason behind this trend was legalizing abortion nationwide, which took place over a decade, with Roe as a focal point. So Roe solidified this improvement in maternal mortality rates.",Lauren Carroll,"Hillary Clinton says her opponent Donald Trump wants to take the country back to a time that was bad for women’s reproductive health. ""When Donald Trump says ‘let’s make America great again,’ that is code for ‘let’s take America backward.’ Back to a time when opportunity and dignity were reserved for some, not all,"" she said in June 10 remarks at a Planned Parenthood event. ""Back to the days when abortion was illegal, women had far fewer options, and life for too many women and girls was limited. Well, Donald, those days are over."" Clinton went on to note significant moments in history for women’s health, notably the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, Roe vs. Wade. ""So young women were no longer dying in emergency rooms and back alleys from botched, illegal abortions,"" she said. ""And this is a fact that is not often heard, but I hope you will repeat it: America’s maternal mortality rate dropped dramatically."" We decided to look into Clinton’s factoid: that Roe vs. Wade resulted in a decreased number of women dying as a result of pregnancy complications. Maternal mortality rates, which are the number of deaths per 100,000 live births, were already declining rapidly in the years prior to the January 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, according to the Vital Statistics of the United States, maintained by the Centers for Disease Control. This is also true looking just at mortality rates related to abortion. In 1965, about 32 women for every 100,000 live births died as a result of pregnancy complications, including abortions. It fell steadily every year leading up to Roe in 1973, when the rate was 15.2. The rate continued to decrease in the years after, to 9.6 in 1979. You can see in the graph that there is a slightly bigger drop than previous years in maternal mortality rates between 1972 and 1973, during which the Supreme Court decided Roe. The same pattern is visible for abortion-related deaths, with a rate of 6.3 in 1965, falling to fewer than 1 in the years after Roe. Both overall maternal mortality and abortion mortality were declining in the years leading up to Roe due to better antibiotics, blood banks and other medical advancements, said David Grimes, a clinical professor in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. However, the decline in abortion related-deaths accelerated when abortion started to become legal. It’s also worth noting that before abortion became legal, the number of abortions — and thus the number of abortion-related deaths — were likely underreported. While Roe is a focal point, the decline in maternal mortality as a result of legalized abortion took place over about a decade — from the time states began to legalize abortion on their own in 1966 to when the rest transitioned to complying with the Supreme Court ruling in the late 1970s, said Johanna Schoen, an expert in reproductive rights history and professor at Rutgers University. By the time the court decided Roe in 1973, New York, Alaska, Hawaii and Washington legalized abortion in nearly all cases, while about 13 other states legalized it in some cases, such as in the case of rape or incest. Legalizing abortion gave medical professionals the okay to conduct the procedure out in the open and to research safer methods, which helped bring overall maternal mortality rates down. So not only were women moving from less-safe illegal abortions to legal ones, the legal abortions were becoming safer. In fact, receiving an abortion now carries a lower mortality risk than moving forward with a pregnancy. ""With the legalization of abortion and the simultaneous introduction of medical equipment to perform first trimester abortions with vacuum aspiration machines, a previously clandestine and dangerous procedure became safe, quick, and inexpensive almost overnight,"" Schoen wrote in her book, Abortion after Roe. The fact that legalizing abortion was able to affect overall maternal mortality rates is a testament to how many women were having abortions at the time, Schoen told PolitiFact. In a stark turn of events, maternal mortality rates are currently on the rise in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control. This sets the United States apart from its peer countries, which have generally seen continued declines. Researchers hypothesize that the increase has to do with women getting pregnant while suffering from a chronic illness like diabetes, more women giving birth via higher-risk cesarean sections, or hospitals are getting better at reporting maternal deaths. Our ruling As a result of Roe vs. Wade, ""America’s maternal mortality rate dropped dramatically."" Rates of women dying as a result of pregnancy complications were already on the decline when the Supreme Court decided Roe vs. Wade. But experts told us that a primary reason behind this trend was legalizing abortion nationwide, which took place over a decade, with Roe as a focal point. So Roe solidified this improvement in maternal mortality rates.",true,"Abortion, National, Public Health, Supreme Court, Women, Hillary Clinton, "
1143,22454,Alan Grayson Says Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s cuts to education are the same as his proposed corporate income tax rate reduction.,"March 8, 2011","Alan Grayson returns to MSNBC stage, criticizes Gov. Rick Scott's corporate tax cut plan",Aaron Sharockman,"Minutes after Florida Gov. Rick Scott finished delivering his first State of the State address, a trio of Democrats took turns rebuffing the new governor on everything he just said. Senate Minority Leader Nan Rich and House Minority Leader Ron Saunders came first in brief televised remarks, attacking Scott’s plans to cut education funding and make teachers, firefighters and police officers take de facto pay cuts in order to contribute to their own retirement. They were, in many ways, a warm-up act for former Florida U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, who used a national cable platform offered by MSNBC to excoriate Scott's plans. Grayson opened the interview on March 8, 2011, by answering a question about how Scott -- whose former hospital company Columbia/HCA pleaded guilty to 14 corporate felonies and paid $1.7 billion in fines -- could be elected governor in the first place. He said it was par for the course for Florida Republicans. ""The last head of the Republican Party of Florida was literally led away in chains and indicted,"" Grayson said, referring to deposed RPOF chairman Jim Greer. Then Grayson cracked a joke, saying Scott once refused to answer questions during a deposition by invoking his 5th Amendment constitutional rights 75 times. ""That’s like pleading the 375th."" Grayson closed the interview by criticizing Scott’s plan to cut and eventually eliminate the state’s 5.5 percent corporate income tax, suggesting education spending reductions are funding the corporate tax cut. ""He wants to eliminate the corporate income tax and cut corporate taxes in Florida by $1.5 billion,"" Grayson said. ""He wants to cut funding for the schools by $1.5 billion. ""He’s taking money out of children’s pockets dollar for dollar so he can stuff it in his own."" We knew we’d find a fact check among all the one-liners. We wanted to see if Grayson’s shrewd ledger work is right: Does Scott’s budget reduce education funding by the same amount he would cut corporate taxes? The numbers are fairly easy to find, it turns out. Scott’s budget proposal for 2011-12 reduces the total amount of state K-12 education funding from $18.2 billion, to $16.5 billion -- a total cut of $1.7 billion. That number includes local property taxes the state mandates school boards collect (the required local effort), the state contribution from sales tax revenues and trust funds, and money passing through the state from the federal government. The cuts break down this way (we’re rounding a bit, so everything might not add up exactly):  * The state’s contribution would decrease by about $11 million, but remain largely the same, about $8.9 billion. * Required local education taxes would shrink by about $660 million, and discretionary local taxes would shrink an additional $200 million -- shrinking the local contribution from about $8.4 billion to nearly $7.5 billion. * And the state also would not replace about $873 million in federal stimulus funds. On the other side of the ledger is Scott’s proposed cut to the 5.5 percent corporate income tax. The tax is exactly what it sounds like -- it’s paid as a percentage of the incomes of Florida businesses. Florida already has one of the lower corporate tax rates in the country, but Scott has made eliminating the tax a priority. As part of his 2011-12 budget, Scott proposes reducing the tax rate to 3 percent. His office says the reduction will save corporations $460 million. Put another way, the cut will trim state revenues as part of the 2011-12 budget by $460 million. It doesn’t take an Ivy League mathematics degree to figure out that the numbers don’t begin to line up the way Grayson suggests. The tax cuts represent $460 million, which is less than one third of the $1.7 billion education cut. Part of the issue might be Scott’s budget proposal is actually for two years -- 2011-12 and 2012-13. Over two years -- after factoring in a second reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 3 to 2.5 percent -- corporations would save a total of $1.5 billion, according to the governor’s office. But that’s not being fair -- $1.5 billion over two years doesn’t exactly compare to $1.7 billion over one year. In reviewing Scott’s tax-cutting proposals, it appears Grayson’s error also could have been singling out the corporate income tax as a way to cast Scott as a greedy CEO-type looking out only for his buddies. As we said in a previous item, Scott is proposing a total of $1.7 billion in tax and fee cuts as part of his 2011-12 budget. Scott’s proposal includes cuts to the corporate income tax, a cut to required school district property taxes, and a cut to unemployment taxes. PolitiFact Florida has previously ruled that roughly half of those cuts apply only to businesses, while half apply to homeowners and typical Floridians. Look at the numbers -- a total of $1.7 billion in tax and fee cuts in 2011-12 versus a proposed total education funding cut of $1.7 billion. They match (well, they’re not identical, because of rounding). And there’s one final way to look at this. The corporate income tax is estimated to collect about $2 billion in the current budget year. If it’s eliminated, a goal of Scott’s, that would be $2 billion less the state would receive. That’s on the order of the $1.7 billion K-12 education Scott is proposing for 2011-12. But again, that’s comparing additional budget years beyond even 2012-13 to cuts coming this year. On MSNBC, Grayson targeted Scott’s proposal to cut the corporate income tax, suggesting the cuts for corporate CEOs are being paid for on the back of students. While he’s right that any tax cut results in money not available to be spent on programs like education, he gets his numbers wrong. If Grayson had said the tax cuts and fees being proposed by Scott are being paid for by education cuts, he’d have more of a point. But sticking to what he said.",false,"Education, State Budget, Taxes, Florida, Alan Grayson, "
1144,21739,Lois Kolkhorst Says $500 billion in Medicare cuts are coming.,"July 17, 2011",Lois Kolkhorst says $500 billion in Medicare cuts are coming,W. Gardner Selby,"Defending her own health care measure, state Rep. Lois Kolkhorst answered a colleague’s query about preserving insurance for the elderly of Texas by warning that national cuts loom. The Brenham Republican, who chairs the House Public Health Committee, said during June 15 floor debate: ""We know they are reducing the entitlement to Medicare."" She added: ""We know that we have these cuts coming our way of over half a trillion to Medicare."" We do? Some background: PolitiFact teams in Washington and other states have pointed out that it’s incorrect to deem reductions in the growth of Medicare spending, written into the federal health care overhaul signed into law last year by President Barack Obama, as cuts. These reductions are being counted as projected savings compared to what would have happened without the change in law. The program’s overall costs are projected to increase to $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in 2009, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Also, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, tagged Obamacare by critics, doesn’t eliminate benefits. Indeed, portions of the law improve benefits and coverage, according to Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit health care research organization. Medicare will cover more preventive health care services, such as wellness visits, and recipients won't face the ""doughnut hole"" gap in prescription coverage imposed under an existing Medicare program. Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending by helping the program operate more efficiently and fund other coverage expansions to the uninsured. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care, Neuman has said. To back up Kolkhorst's claim, which was brought to our attention by Democratic activist Phillip Martin, her office passed along a September 2010 Wall Street Journal opinion piece quoting Richard S. Foster, Medicare's chief actuary, outlining intended cuts in payments to medical providers and hospitals as well as reductions in payments for Medicare Advantage, an optional program where the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare recipients. It was hoped that competition between private insurers for Medicare Advantage programs would drive down costs and make the system more efficient, ultimately saving the federal government money. But it has not worked out that way. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said the Advantage programs cost taxpayers an average of 14 percent more than traditional Medicare. The 2010 health care law will phase out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare. The law also calls for slowing increases in payment rates to hospitals and other service providers each year. Also, the law directs a new national board to identify $15.5 billion in savings, though the board — the Independent Payment Advisory Board — is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. Kolkhorst’s office pointed us to the Medicare actuary’s April 2010 analysis, which includes a chart suggesting that through 2019, the new law will net Medicare ""savings"" of $575.1 billion. It also says that 60.5 million Americans will be covered by Medicare in 2019, the same number that would have been covered without a change in law. Foster’s memo says the Medicare savings are to be achieved largely through reduced payments to medical providers including hospitals, tied to raised productivity expectations. It warns, though, that those gains are unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent basis and would also probably prove unworkable and less than projected in some health-care sectors during the law’s roll-out. Moreover, his memo says, health care providers ""for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive portion of their business could find it difficult to remain profitable and, absent legislative intervention, might end their participation in the program (possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries)."" It says its own simulations suggest that about 15 percent of providers in the Medicare program specific to inpatient care in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as well as hospice care and home health services would become unprofitable by 2019 due to the productivity provisions. Kolkhorst’s chief of staff, Chris Steinbach, suggested the projected reductions in rates are tantamount to cuts in Medicare. He said by email: ""If there is an entitlement for everyone eligible to receive a pizza, and we are cutting the rate paid to pizza kitchens by x percent, then there will be less of that entitlement for pizza."" Similarly, Kolkhorst told us the changes built into the 2010 law will reduce access to Medicare. ""You’re splitting hairs to say those are savings; they’re cuts,"" she said, adding: ""Things are going to change ... To say that everything is going to remain as it is today, that’s erroneous."" That last point seems reasonable, but it’s not exactly what she told her House colleagues. The referenced $500 billion figure depends on a slowing in the pace of Medicare cost increases. That’s not the same as cutting back. Medicare spending will still grow; benefits will expand. Still, there remains the prospect of some providers quitting Medicare, possibly making it harder for patients to get care. Kolkhorst’s statement has an element of truth, making it Barely True.",false,"Medicare, Texas, Lois Kolkhorst, "

Experts in data presentation said this was an egregious example of using a chart to mislead.",Linda Qiu,"Congress may have avoided a government shutdown related to Planned Parenthood funding — at least so far — but the controversy over the women’s health organization looks like it’s here to stay. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, sparred with Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards during a high-profile hearing on Sept. 29. One of their face-offs originated with a chart Chaffetz flashed, indicating that Planned Parenthood performed more abortions than ""life-saving procedures"" in 2013, a complete reversal from just seven years ago. The chart features a pair of lines crossing — one headed upward (abortions) and the other headed downward (cancer screening and prevention services). When referring to the chart in the hearing, Chaffetz said, ""In pink, that's the reduction in the breast exams, and the red is the increase in the abortions. That's what's going on in your organization."" ""This is a slide that has never been shown to me before,"" Richards responded. ""Excuse me, my lawyer is informing me that the source of this is actually Americans United for Life, which is an anti-abortion group. So, I would check your source."" ""Then we will get to the bottom of the truth of that,"" Chaffetz agreed. Many news outlets characterized the chart as misleading, so we too wanted to get to the bottom of the truth. As it turns out, Richards’ lawyer was correct about the source of the chart -- it comes from an Americans United for Life web post from June 2015. The chart, we found, gives a misleading impression. The numbers listed on the chart are based on actual statistics, but they are small and were hard to read during the televised hearings. The chart’s most prominent feature — the much larger crossed arrows — suggests a conclusion that’s flat wrong. We reached out to Chaffetz’s office but did not hear back. A spokesperson for Americans United for Life told PolitiFact that the graphic is accurate and honest. Experts, however, begged to differ. ""That graphic is a damn lie,"" said Alberto Cairo, who researches visual communication at the University of Miami. ""Regardless of whatever people think of this issue, this distortion is ethically wrong."" Dueling axes Chaffetz’s chart falls into a category known as a dual-axis chart. On the left side, cancer screenings and prevention services are plotted in the millions. On the right side, abortions are plotted in the hundreds of thousands. But the way the chart was assembled is problematic. For starters, dual-axis charts are particularly susceptible to showing spurious correlations. With two axes, trend lines can be exaggerated and manipulated, as most people ignore the axis labels that put the numbers in context. ""It forces your brain to see a relationship that isn’t there,"" Cairo said. ""As economist Gary Smith once said, ‘If you double the axes, you can double the mischief.’ "" Second, it’s even more inappropriate to use a dual-axis chart when comparing equivalent measures (in this case, the number of services performed by Planned Parenthood) using different scales, said Enrico Bertini, a professor at New York University who studies data visualization and who called the chart ""scandalous."" Typically, dual-axis charts are used to compare lines that represent different things — ""for instance, abortion rates and cost,"" said Bertini. ""But in this case the unit is the same."" ""You cannot put two measures, one in the millions and one in the hundreds, without making it explicit,"" Cairo said. ""We map data into visual properties — height, length, color — but we need to keep the proportions. We cannot force the data to adopt a shape we like."" Finally, perhaps the most egregious decision was to not label the axes. Experts told us that, given this decision, they cannot rule out purposeful deception. ""By claiming to combine these two lines into one graph and then omitting the y-axis, we are being misled into to making a false comparison of two non-equivalent contexts,"" said Noah Iliinsky, a visualization and information designer based in Seattle. ""The graph is absolutely misleading, and intentionally so."" Iliinsky also said he saw ""propagandized design choices"" in the choice of the arrowheads, which suggest a ""strong continuation of these trends, which we don’t know to be true."" Corrected charts With guidance from the experts, we compiled the number of abortions and cancer screenings/prevention services from Planned Parenthood’s annual reports from 2006 to 2013 (we could not find a report from 2008). Here’s what the chart should look like:  As you can see from the chart, the number of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood has essentially held steady, with marginal increases and a modest peak in 2009. It is true, however, that the organization now provides fewer cancer screenings and preventive services, though medical experts said that’s more likely due to changing health guidelines than the organization prioritizing abortions. Spokespersons for Planned Parenthood and for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both pointed to changing guidelines for Pap smears, the screening test for cervical cancer. Medical groups used to recommend an annual Pap, but now suggests the test every three or five years for most women. Planned Parenthood also provides an array of other services such as STI/STD testing and treatment — services that have gone up by 50 percent since 2006 — as well as pregnancy tests. Here’s how all of the services have changed from 2006 to 2013: < A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood told PolitiFact that the number of services provided in each category tend to fluctuate from year to year for myriad reasons, ranging from changes in laws and medical practices to the opening or closure of Planned Parenthood clinics. Megan Christin, a spokesperson for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, speculated that the decline in contraception could be due to a growth in the use of IUDs, which last for five to eight years. Overall, if we compare abortions and non-abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood — and if we use standard scales on the axes, we see largely consistent trend lines for both:  Our ruling At the hearing, Chaffetz presented a chart that showed the number of abortions at Planned Parenthood rising higher than the number of preventive services and cancer screenings between 2006 and 2013. But that’s inaccurate, disputed by the chart’s own, hard to read numerical labels. In fact, there were three times as many cancer screenings and prevention services as abortions in 2013.

The claim has an element of truth but is misleading. https://www",Allison Graves,"Donald Trump is ""too dangerous"" to have access to the nuclear codes, Hillary Clinton emphasizes in a new ad. The ad features soundbites from pundits voicing concern about whether Trump is ready for the responsibilities of the presidency. Speakers include Michael Hayden, former CIA director under George W. Bush; Max Boot, a conservative foreign policy analyst; and Charles Krauthammer, a conservative columnist. (All have criticized Trump on some occasions.) One clip features Gillian Turner, who worked at the White House National Security Council under George W. Bush and Barack Obama, talking on Fox News. Trump ""has been talking about the option of using a nuclear weapon against our Western European allies,"" the ad shows Turner saying. We wanted to fact-check whether the Clinton campaign accurately portrayed Trump’s comments about nuclear weapons and western Europe. In our view, even though Turner made the statement, it was the Clinton campaign’s decision to pull the clip and advance its ""unfit"" argument. Is Clinton’s campaign correct in saying Trump has considered using nuclear weapons against America’s western European allies? Not exactly. What Trump has said The comment in question stems from an MSNBC town hall interview in March. Trump was asked by host Chris Matthews if he might use nuclear weapons. Trump: ""I’d be the last one to use the nuclear weapons, because that’s sort of like the end of the ballgame."" Matthews: ""So, can you take it off the table now? Can you tell the Middle East we are not using the nuclear weapon on anybody?"" Trump: ""I would never say that. I would never take any of my cards off the table."" Matthews: ""How about Europe? We won’t use it in Europe."" Trump: ""I’m not going to take it off the table for anybody."" Matthews: ""You might use it in Europe?"" Trump: ""No. I don’t think so, but — I am not taking cards off the table. I’m not going to use nukes, but I’m not taking cards off the table."" In the same breath, Trump said he would not use nuclear weapons, but he went on to say he wouldn't take it off the table for ""anybody,"" include Europe. He stuck by this phrasing in another interview on The O’Reilly Factor when Eric Bolling asked the same question. ""Europe’s a big place,"" he said. ""I’m not going to take cards off the the table. We have nuclear capability. Now, our capability is going down rapidly because of what we're doing. It's in bad shape. The equipment is not properly maintained. There are all lot of talk about that. And that's a bad thing, not a good thing.The last person to use nuclear would be Donald Trump. That’s the way I feel. I think it’s a horrible thing. The thought of it is horrible, but I don’t want to take anything off the table."" In these two interviews, each held within a day of one another, Trump’s position on nuclear weapons overall and in Europe is convoluted. Yes, he hates the idea, but he doesn’t want to take the option off the table. Experts weigh in Experts we spoke to said Trump’s comments were a departure from previous rhetoric because they’re imprecise, but they noted his refusal to ""take options off the table"" is vaguely in line with U.S. policy. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referred to the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review Report, which focuses on preventing nuclear proliferation, ""Indeed, as long as nuclear weapons exist, the United States will sustain safe, secure, and effective nuclear forces,"" reads the report. ""These nuclear forces will continue to play an essential role in deterring potential adversaries and reassuring allies and partners around the world."" Point being, there are some instances where the United States does not rule out using nuclear weapons, he said, which is why Trump’s ""cards on the table"" policy is somewhat in line with U.S. policy. Jim Walsh, an international security and research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he’s ""seen nothing"" suggesting Trump would use nuclear weapons against America’s European allies. ""What Trump may be trying to say is actually consistent with traditional U.S. doctrine, that is, we are prepared to use (nuclear weapons) to counter a Russian/Soviet invasion of Western Europe with conventional forces,"" Walsh, who is not a fan of Trump, said. ""That's a NATO commitment."" The usual rhetoric -- that America would use nuclear weapons against Soviets to protect our allies -- is in line with what previous presidents have said, said Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University. It should be noted that Nephew said he is ""repelled by Trump and his rhetoric, including around nuclear weapons."" ""Previous presidents have spoken about the use of nuclear weapons to threaten the Soviets and others that might attack our allies,"" Nephew said. ""They have talked about battlefield uses only in an extreme crisis and rarely spoken about tactical nuclear weapons at all (which would be what a normal president would be referring to: using nuclear weapons to attack enemy forces invading our Allies)."" After speaking to experts, we can conclude that Trump’s comments are vague, but do not translate directly into using weapons against our European allies.

And a US audience was given no perspective on how/whether it’s being analyzed here.","William Heisel,Gary Schwitzer","The story says that the procedure “costs about $2,000, takes about an hour, and the patient is typically kept overnight in the hospital for observation.” That’s good information. Whether most insurance companies cover the therapy would have been good additional context. And the story could have included the costs for complications from the procedure – with 8 of the patients experiencing partial lung collapse with respiratory symptoms, this drives up the cost substantially. Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion. The story says that microwave ablation “eliminated lung tumors in 19 of 28 patients. Eight months later, none of the tumors had come back.” It also paraphrases one of the study’s authors saying “Tumors shrank or stopped growing in the other nine patients”. We were glad to see additional comments later in the story pointing out that eight months is not enough time to determine whether cancer is going to return. Taken as a whole, the story shows readers that the results of this therapy — while dramatic at first glance — require further research. The story explains the short term harms associated with the therapy, noting that there were no “major complications” and that eight of the 28 patients “had temporary trouble breathing due to a partially collapsed lung, but all got better on their own within a week.”  It would help to provide further information about whether those collapsed lungs required additional monitoring or hospitalization days. The information about the quality of the evidence was a bit scattered, but we think most readers would see that far more work needs to be done to establish microwave ablation as the first choice for cancer patients. The story calls it a “preliminary study” and notes that findings were presented at a Radiological Society of North America conference. The story included boilerplate language at the end about why these findings should be considered preliminary for that reason. The story also notes a key limitation in the study, which is how long patients were followed. It says that patients should be followed for at least five years before declaring that the therapy has adequately eliminated any tumors. We have a problem in this category. The story lists the total numbers of patients in the US living with lung cancer, when in fact the therapy is only being tested/applicable to patients with inoperable lung tumors. This greatly overestimates the number of people for whom this therapy might be applicable. It would have been possible to provide an estimate of the number of inoperable tumors. The story quotes one independent source: American Society of Clinical Oncology spokesman Gregory Masters, MD, a medical oncologist at the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center. More sources could have deepened our understanding of the technique. The story spells out both the current treatment options and potential new therapies. It says, “Standard treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Researchers are looking at a number of ways of destroying tumors with heat from radiofrequency waves or by freezing it, for example.” But the story could have given even a little information about how the tumor reduction rates in this preliminary study stack up against chemotherapy and radiation. Readers are really only told that this was a study in Italy and that “US researchers say the technique certainly shows promise.” The story does not make it clear whether a patient could expect to have this technique performed in a typical hospital or how many clinical trials are currently ongoing involving microwave ablation. As with the “availability” criterion, the novelty of the technique is a bit of a mystery, although the story does say that “microwave ablation is being studied for the treatment of liver, kidney, and bone cancers.”  How long has it been studied or in use? We’re not given a clue. It does not appear that the story relied solely on a press release.",true,lung disease

As a representative of all of the Missouri Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers, McGinty said Missouri is currently working with law enforcement and developing a statewide system to better address behavioral health crises. ""It’s hard to really say which state, if any, is leading the country for providing services for mental and behavioral health,"" said Ronald Honberg, senior policy advisor for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Honberg points out that there is no system in place for measuring this. ""It’s fair to say that Missouri has been innovative,"" said Honberg, pointing to Senator Blunt and Joe Parks as champions in the cause in improving coordination between mental and behavioral health. Parks is the Medicaid director for the Missouri Department of Social Services and a member of the National Council for Behavioral Health. Some of the innovative work Missouri has been doing is with Emergency Departments and Mental Health First Aid, which are considered cutting edge across the country. Future of mental and behavioral health Currently there are no statistics to show where Missouri stands in improving services for mental and behavioral health as part of the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic demonstration, but measures are to be reported to the federal government according to McGinty, president of the Missouri Coalition. ""Under the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic demonstration, sponsored by Senator Blunt, we will finally start reporting to the federal government real behavioral health measures,"" McGinty said. Recently, Sens. Blunt and Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, along with Reps. Leonard Lance, R-New Jersey, and Doris Matsui, D-California, announced this would be expanded to 11 more states. With the inclusion of more states it will more likely create distinctions in who is and is not leading the nation in regard to improving services for mental and behavioral health. As of now, Missouri is implementing new measures to address whole-person care. Some of these initiatives include a partnership for Hope Waiver for Developmental Disabilities and the construction of a new, state-of-the-art, high security facility at Fulton State Hospital. ""The state that actually is moving ahead fastest, gets the most done, where access and quality are both being addressed, the state that not only comes to my mind but everyone in the field’s mind, is Missouri,"" said Linda Rosenberg, CEO of the National Council for Behavioral Health in a 2016 press release. Our ruling Blunt said Missouri ""is leading the country when it comes to improving services for mental and behavioral health."" Under the demonstration program sponsored by Blunt, Missouri will start reporting real behavioral health measures to the federal government. The reports will include information regarding time between request for treatment and treatment, hospital follow-up and medication adherence. Experts agree that Missouri has started several new initiatives to improve and innovate when it comes to services for mental and behavioral health.

1157,29286,"Manuka honey, as a topical treatment, is better than all known antibiotics.","October 20, 2017","While there is growing evidence to suggest an important role for manuka honey for wound care and recalcitrant infections, the research is too preliminary and largely untested on humans to truly know its complete potential, and it is certainly too preliminary to suggest it is “better than all known antibiotics.” As such, we rank this claim as mostly false.",Alex Kasprak,"Despite celebrity endorsements from Gwyneth Paltrow and other actresses-turned-lifestyle brands, humans have used honey as a treatment for skin ailments and infections for thousands of years. Early practitioners may not have known why, but, later scientific discoveries elucidated one of the primary reasons behind honey’s success as an antiseptic — it naturally produces hydrogen peroxide when diluted, per a 2014 review paper: All undiluted raw honeys restrict microbial growth due to their osmolarity and acidity. On dilution many honeys produce low, sustained levels of hydrogen peroxide by the oxidation of glucose by glucose oxidase. Since 1989, however, a growing body of work has suggested that one particular kind of honey called manuka honey, found in New Zealand and Australia and derived from bees that feed on the manuka bush (Leptospermum scoparium), appears to have additional antiseptic and antibiotic properties likely attributed to something beyond the hydrogen peroxide. Later research, beginning in 2008, determined that the main compound responsible for this increased antimicrobial activity is a chemical called methylglyoxal (MGO), a byproduct of the bee’s honey production. Some manuka honey contains up to 100 times more MGO than other honeys. It is against this backdrop of scientific research that viral news stories and specialty honey distributors frequently extol the virtues of manuka honey. Yet, exaggerations are frequent. In viral post from January 2017, the website Healthy Holistic Living made this claim of the honey: Not all honey is created equal. While the benefits of raw, unprocessed honey have been well-documented over the centuries, Australian researchers have found one type of honey, called Manuka honey, to be better than all known antibiotics. That story, as well as a similar post on the missed-bee-pun-opportunity website bewellhub.com from October 2017, highlights research from October 2010 and January 2015 (not exactly breaking science news) to suggest manuka honey has potential to avoid antibiotic resistance. They claim it could fight some strains of Staphylococcus aureus, which can develop marked resistance to antibiotics in the form of MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: In the aforementioned studies, Australian researchers found that the honey killed every bacteria or pathogen it was tested on […]. The honey can be applied topically to help fight against infections of the skin, cuts and insect bites, or taken internally. The most exciting difference with the manuka honey that was tested is that none of superbugs killed by the honey were able to build up immunity, a common problem with today’s antibiotics. The older 2010 study, published in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, is a preliminary, but not definitive, suggestion that treating wounds with honey does not result in honey-resistant bacteria, but this research was not performed on human test subjects, and was instead performed using the tightly controlled conditions of a petri dish: Two cultures of bacteria from reference collections […] and four cultures isolated from wounds […] were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of manuka honey in continuous and stepwise training experiments to determine whether the susceptibility to honey diminished. Reduced susceptibilities to manuka honey in the test organisms during long-term stepwise resistance training were found, but these changes were not permanent and honey-resistant mutants were not detected. The risk of bacteria acquiring resistance to honey will be low if high concentrations are maintained clinically. While it is accurate to suggest this study showed that manuka honey “killed every bacteria or pathogen it was tested” on, it would be inaccurate to suggest that evidence from two specific strains of bacteria and four heterogenous samples taken from wounds suggest broad superiority over antibiotics in all cases. In fact, much of the current research on manuka honey is focused on the possibility that, medically, it could be used in combination with other antibiotics, primarily for hard to fight infections like MRSA. The more recent 2015 study highlighted in the bewellhub.com post and published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology, primarily addressed that issue looking at a variety of Staphylococcus infections: We demonstrate that manuka-type honey combined with [one of four tested] antibiotics frequently produces a synergistic effect. In some cases when synergism was not observed, there was a significant enhancement in antibiotic susceptibility. Some strains that were highly resistant to an antibiotic when present alone become sensitive to clinically achievable concentrations when combined with honey. However, not all of the S. aureus strains tested responded in the same way to these combinational treatments. Our findings support the use of NZ manuka-type honeys in clinical treatment against S. aureus-related infections and extend their potential use as an antibiotic adjuvant in combinational therapy. This study, like the one discussed before, was done using cultures, and was not performed on actual human subjects, as well. In a 2014 paper reviewing the available science for manuka honey as a topical treatment for infections, the authors suggest that there is certainly potential for manuka honey, but more human trials will need to be conducted to get a clearer picture and gain widespread acceptance: Despite accumulating evidence of the efficacy of manuka honey in inhibiting wound pathogens in vitro, substantive in vivo data are required because practitioners influenced by evidence-based medicine are likely to need objective clinical evidence before they risk adding manuka honey to their armament as a first-choice topical treatment. Since laboratory studies carry little weight in the hierarchy of evidence, suitable funds must be found to support clinical investigation. An effective topical antimicrobial could have a significant impact on the fight to limit the spread of MRSA in healthcare establishments.",false,"Medical, antibiotic resistance, honey, manuka honey"

This footage racked up millions of views when it was shared on Facebook along with the caption: “So Wrong: A student puts laxative in the school’s lemonade”: This video does not capture real students at a high school suffering bouts of diarrhea after a student spiked their lemonade with laxatives. This footage was taken from the Netflix mockumentary television series American Vandal and depicts a staged incident involving a group of actors. American Vandal plays like a true crime documentary, but instead of focusing on villainous acts such as murder, the mockumentary takes place in a high school and features juvenile pranks and acts of vandalism. The second season of the show, which made its debut just a few days before this video went viral, opened with an episode entitled “Brown Out.” The New Yorker described the opening sequence of that episode thusly: I got a queasy feeling watching the opening sequence of the new season of “American Vandal,” and not only because it showed a lunchroom full of teenagers soiling themselves. The scene is certainly disgusting: in an event known afterward as “the Brownout,” students at the fictional St. Bernardine prep school in tony Bellevue, Washington, having been poisoned by laxative-tainted lemonade, suffer together in a grisly act of mass defecation, all of it memorialized in real time and shared on social media.

We didn't find a factual path to this figure and, in fact, spotted no state-posted information specifying a relevant count of criminal arrests or convictions for the six-plus years singled out by Patrick. The DPS has said that more than 638,000 charges and over 286,000 convictions were accumulated through their ""criminal careers"" by more than 240,000 ""criminal aliens"" booked into Texas jails in the six-plus years. Unsaid: Some of those people were living in the U.S. with legal authorization. We find Patrick’s statement inaccurate and ridiculous. The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. ",W. Gardner Selby,"Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, seeking re-election, entered 2018 by warning on his campaign’s Facebook page that ""criminal aliens"" committed more than 500,000 Texas crimes in recent years. We wondered about Patrick’s declaration in part because we’d just found scant data about Texas crimes committed by individuals living illegally in the United States. Also, research rooted in U.S. Census Bureau data suggests that nationally, unauthorized immigrants commit few crimes. For that other fact-check, we calculated from annual state-posted crime reports that the 170,000 arrests of ""criminal immigrants"" proclaimed by a Texas House member at a 2015 hearing represented about 4 percent of all the adult arrests in the state from 2011 through 2015. But absent expert analysis, we wouldn't brandish that percentage as a fact. Here’s Patrick’s statement on Facebook, which he presented against the backdrop of a wire fence: ""566,000 crimes made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last 6 years."" We took that to mean that ""criminal aliens"" were found guilty of 566,000 crimes over six years. Then again, text in smaller print to the right of Patrick’s fence-backdropped statement offers a different interpretation. That text says: ""In the past six years, criminal aliens have been charged with more than 566,000 crimes in Texas including kidnapping, homicide, burglary, and much more. There is no excuse for endangering our communities by allowing criminal aliens who have committed a crime to go free."" Some perspective: We estimate, starting from Texas Department of Public Safety annual crime reports for 2011 through 2016, that there were 5,513,663 adult criminal arrests in the state in the six-plus years referenced by Patrick. If the 566,000 figure offered by Patrick solely reflects arrests, he was referring to about 10 percent of adult arrests in the state. Patrick points to state-posted figures We asked Patrick, a Houston Republican who touts his support for a secure U.S.-Mexico border in a fresh video ad, about the basis of his 566,000 ""crimes made"" statement. A spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, replied by email: ""We have answered this question many times."" Garcia provided a link to a familiar DPS web page, ""Historical Arrest and Conviction Data for Select Offenses Associated with Criminal Aliens:""        SOURCE: Web page, ""Historical Arrest and Conviction Data for Select Offenses Associated with Criminal Aliens,"" Texas Department of Public Safety, undated (accessed Jan. 23, 2018) Adding up the chart’s tallied arrests, covering 11 crime categories, gets you to 638,411 arrests ""associated with criminal aliens."" And did all those arrests occur in the six-plus years noted by Patrick on Facebook? Not so. A related DPS web page noted by Garcia, ""Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,"" says that according to Department of Homeland Security ""status indicators, over 240,000 criminal aliens have been booked into local Texas jails between June 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017. During their criminal careers,"" it says, ""these criminal aliens were charged with more than 638,000 criminal offenses."" We read ""criminal careers"" to refer to the booked individuals’ lifetime rap sheets. More from the DPS page about those ""career"" arrests: ""Those arrests include 1,300 homicide charges; 76,044 assault charges; 18,126 burglary charges; 76,660 drug charges; 774 kidnapping charges; 43,591 theft charges; 49,154 obstructing police charges; 4,180 robbery charges; 6,878 sexual assault charges; and 9,561 weapon charges."" Unmentioned in that text: 352,143 of all the tallied arrests, 55 percent, were for ""all other offenses,"" according to the DPS. According to DPS criminal history records, the agency says, those 638,000-plus criminal charges ""have thus far resulted in over 286,000 convictions."" The conviction count presented on the chart offered as Patrick’s backup indicates 286,101 convictions. The DPS page says the convictions break out to 547 homicide convictions; 28,592 assault convictions; 8,915 burglary convictions; 37,581 drug convictions; 268 kidnapping convictions; 19,803 theft convictions; 24,084 obstructing police convictions; 2,153 robbery convictions; 3,164 sexual assault convictions; and 3,973 weapon convictions."" Its text on the web page doesn’t mention the 157,021 included convictions for other offenses accounting for 55 percent of the total convictions. We spotted a couple other wrinkles. DPS’s web page indirectly reminds that a ""criminal alien"" isn’t necessarily someone living in the country without documentation. ""Of the total criminal aliens arrested in that timeframe,"" the page says, ""over 160,000 or 66% were identified by DHS status as being in the U.S. illegally at the time of their last arrest."" We noticed too that the DPS doesn’t specify how many of the noted arrests or convictions through criminal careers tie to the 160,000-plus people believed to be living here illegally at the time of their latest arrest. Our requests to the DPS to corroborate Patrick’s 566,000 figure didn’t yield additional information. Our ruling Patrick said that ""566,000 crimes"" were ""made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last 6 years."" We didn't find a factual path to this figure and, in fact, spotted no state-posted information specifying a relevant count of criminal arrests or convictions for the six-plus years singled out by Patrick.

What's false: The vast majority of migrants waiting to have their asylum claims processed by the United States had nothing to do with this demand.",Bethania Palma,"On 12 December 2018, Fox News reported that a group of Central American migrants currently housed in Tijuana, Mexico, and hoping to present asylum claims to the United States had demanded $50,000 each from the Trump administration in exchange for returning home. Although the group that made the demand was relatively small (100-plus people out of a total of the roughly 3,000 housed at El Barretal migrant shelter), the outrageous-sounding headline captured most readers’ attention: “Migrant group demands Trump either let them in or pay them each $50G to turn around.” The Fox News report was aggregated from the work of the San Diego Union-Tribune, which had earlier that day reported that:  The first group demanding action, numbering about 100, arrived at the U.S. Consulate at about 11 am. The migrants said they were asking that the Trump Administration pay them $50,000 each or allow them into the U.S. When asked how the group came up with the $50,000 figure, organizer Alfonso Guerrero Ulloa of Honduras, said they chose that number as a group … [A] second letter, delivered around 1:20 p.m., came from a separate group of caravan members asking for the U.S. to speed up the asylum process. Specifically, the group asked U.S. immigration officials to admit up to 300 asylum seekers at the San Ysidro Port of Entry each day. Currently, officials admit between 40 and 100 asylum seekers. The group of migrants say the slow pace violates American and international laws that call for an immediate process, and places vulnerable migrants at risk. The Union-Tribune reported that the group demanding money in exchange for turning around and going home was organized by Alfonso Guerrero Ulloa, a 54-year-old Honduran who sought political asylum in Mexico after being accused (falsely, he maintains) by the Honduran government of planting a bomb in a Chinese restaurant that injured six U.S. soldiers and a civilian in 1987. Ulloa joined the caravan in early November 2018 and viewed it as something of a political cause, according to the Union-Tribune: [Ulloa] led a group of 100 migrants to the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana asking President Donald Trump to either let the migrants into the United States or oust [Honduran President Juan Orlando] Hernandez from office and pay each migrant $50,000 to go back to Honduras. He based that figure on what he considers reparations from the U.S. for their intervention in Central America. “The United States is directly responsible for this humanitarian crisis,” he said. “Honduras is practically colonized by the United States.”  The Trump administration has sought to require that Central American migrants apply for asylum in the “safe third country” of Mexico rather than in the U.S. According to the Union-Tribune, roughly 2,500 have already done so, but humanitarian groups — including the international medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) — maintain that Mexico (still a developing country) is not safe for many of them, with women, children, and members of the LGBT community particularly vulnerable to violence in Mexico: MSF medical data shows that a quarter of our medical consultations for migrants and refugees in Mexico are related to injuries from intentional violence. Ninety per cent of our mental health consultations are related to violence. Our patients are suffering from anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, among other conditions, which have severe consequences on their ability to function. Women, children, and members of the Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-Transgender-Queer (LGBTQ) community are more vulnerable to certain types of violence and require specific protection measures that are not effectively in place in Mexico. The migrants arrived in Tijuana roughly one month before the Fox News report. As they traveled north in a caravan that originated in northern Honduras on 12 October 2018, they were a constant target of hoaxes and misinformation, particularly in the lead-up to the 6 November 2018 midterm elections in the U.S.",true,"Politics, donald trump, fox news, honduran caravan"

Conte did not specify which factories and businesses will be considered crucial to keep the country going. The government is expected to publish an emergency decree on Sunday to make the new crackdown immediately effective. Supermarkets, pharmacies, postal and banking services will remain open and essential public services including transport will be ensured. “We are slowing down the country’s production engine but we are not stopping it,” Conte said.

On Saturday fatalities jumped by 793 to 4,825 in the largest one-day rise since the contagion emerged a month ago. Reported infections rose to 53,578 from 47,021, the Civil Protection Agency said. There were 2,857 people in intensive care, up from 2,655.

Late on Friday the EU Commission moved to formalize a deal reached by EU finance ministers on March 5 to suspend EU budget rules that limit borrowing, giving Italy and other governments a free hand to fight the disease. Italy’s failure to reduce its huge debt of 134% of gross domestic product would normally have drawn a rebuke from the EU executive, but von der Leyen said there were now other priorities. “The Italian government will be able to put as much money into the economy as needed. Normal budget rules, debt rules for example, will not be applied at this stage,” she said. Brussels is expected next week to unveil a plan for using the euro zone’s bailout fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which could unlock unlimited sovereign bond purchases by the European Central Bank. “This work is ongoing,” Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said in an interview with Reuters.

To be clear, there is no debate on the danger.”According to CBS News correspondent Weijia Jiang, the Trump administration responded by attacking news outlets; White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement on April 24, 2020:President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday’s briefing. Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines.Trump also attempted to backtrack a day later, claiming that he was being “sarcastic” and then telling reporter Jeff Mason, “I was looking at you.”“No you weren’t sir,” Mason responded. “I wasn’t there yesterday.”Huffington Post reporter Jennifer Bendery posted a transcript of the exchange:Reporter: Some doctors want you to clarify that you weren’t telling people to inject disinfectant into their veins.Trump: I was being sarcastic, obviously, based on the way the question was asked.

Lord help others to see the Truth!”Grenon’s “church” was also ordered by a federal court to stop selling its product after the US Justice Department requested a temporary injunction against the group, which had already incurred a warning letter from the FDA over its practices.“Despite a previous warning, the Genesis II Church of Healing has continued to actively place consumers at risk by peddling potentially dangerous and unapproved chlorine dioxide products,” Hahn said in a statement. “We will not stand for this, and the FDA remains fully committed to taking strong enforcement action against any sellers who place unsuspecting American consumers at risk by offering their unproven products to treat serious diseases.”Update, April 24 2020, 9:20 a.m.: Updated with comments from the Food and Drug Administration and Reckitt Benckiser as well as a note on the New York Times’ coverage of the story.Update, April 24 2020, 10:07 a.m.: Updated with response from the Times.Update, April 24 2020, 11:41 a.m.: Updated with further comments from Trump and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.Update, April 24 2020, 12:37 p.m.: Updated with notes on Trump being contacted by Mark Grenon.Comments",true,"Fact Checks, Politics"
1169,1688,Amazonian tribe study shows how human bodily bacteria is changing.,"April 17, 2015","Everyone’s body is brimming with bacteria, and these microbes do plenty of good things like building the immune system and helping digestion. But modern diets, antibiotics and hygiene seem to be reducing the range of microbes occupying our anatomy.",Will Dunham,"A study published on Friday looking at the gut, mouth and skin microbes in people from a small, isolated tribe in southern Venezuela’s Amazonian jungles shows just how much modern life may be altering humankind’s bodily bacteria. The Yanomami villagers, secluded from the outside world until 2009, possessed the most diverse collection of bacteria ever found in people including some never before detected in humans, said scientists whose research appears in the journal Science Advances. The researchers were surprised to learn the Yanomami’s microbes harbored antibiotic-resistant genes including those conferring resistance to manmade antibiotics, considering they never had exposure to commercial antibiotics. Every person hosts trillions of microbes, collectively called the microbiota, that live in and on virtually every part of the body. They contribute to functions essential to human health including immune system development, processing food and confronting invading pathogens. “Our study suggests that the pre-modern human microbiota was composed of a greater diversity of bacteria and a greater diversity of bacterial functions when compared to populations impacted by modern practices, such as processed foods and antibiotics,” said pathology and immunology professor Gautam Dantas of Washington University in St. Louis. A microbiota diversity decline may be linked to the increase in the past several decades of immunological and metabolic diseases such as asthma, allergies, diabetes and obesity, said Maria Dominguez-Bello, a professor of medicine at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. The researchers analyzed microbial samples from 34 of the 54 Yanomami villagers. They were compared to a United States group, another Venezuelan Amazonian indigenous people, the Guahibo, and residents of rural Malawi in southern Africa. Yanomami were found to have twice the number of microbe varieties of the U.S. subjects and 30 to 40 percent more diversity than the Malawians and Guahibo. Some of the bacteria found in the Yanomami but not in the others offer beneficial effects like protecting against kidney stones.

For example: Sulfur dioxide is a pollutant that can severely affect a person’s health and, in extreme cases, be fatal. Nitrogen oxide is another common and nasty pollutant that makes people sick. Scientists and non-scientists as well as Republicans and Democrats generally agree the stuff is bad for you. But how you deal with it is where agreement ends -- at least in Congress. On the House floor Sept. 23, Republicans muscled through legislation that would delay or scrap rules to reduce mercury and other harmful air emissions, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Though the bill passed, it’s highly unlikely to pass the Senate and would be vetoed by President Barack Obama if it did. Nevertheless, the House debate was lively. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., was one of the loudest critics, insisting that delaying the tougher air pollution rules would have dire results. ""Every year these protections are delayed, another 34,000 people will die prematurely,"" he said. Really? That’s a lot of dead bodies and it’s very specific. Perfect for PolitiFact. First, some background. As passed on a nearly party-line vote of 249-169, the bill would, among other things, require the president to set up a committee of Cabinet-level officials to evaluate the toll that a dozen-plus Environmental Protection Agency regulations would have on jobs, electricity, gasoline prices and competitiveness. Republicans said action was needed to slow down a runaway bureaucracy. ""While there are reasonable regulations that protect our children and help keep our environment clean, we need to stop unelected bureaucrats from imposing excessive regulations that unnecessarily increase costs for consumers and make it harder for our economy to create jobs,"" House Speaker John Boehner said. Blumenauer and other Democrats said the bill was a craven gift to business that would result in dirtier air and more death. Blumenauer’s dire prediction was directed at the bill’s delay of something called the Cross‐State Air Pollution Rule which would limit the amount of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide belching from power plants in 27 states. The pollutants react in the atmosphere to create ground-level ozone and set free tiny particulates that can damage lung capacity and cause respiratory problems. In real numbers, the EPA says the rules would reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide from the plants by 6.4 million tons a year (from 8.8 million tons in 2005) and to 1.4 million tons a year of nitrogen oxide (from 2.6 million tons annually in 2005). Those are big numbers and Blumenauer argued Sept. 22 during floor debate that lawmakers voting for the bill would be directly responsible for making people sick. ""The losers are hundreds of thousands of people (who) will die, get illness from cancer, asthma, lost school days, millions of lost work days, the lost quality of life that is documented beyond belief,"" he said. ""This is real, and these people lose."" Blumenauer’s aides said he was relying on studies conducted by the EPA to support his claim. The most authoritative of those studies is a 414-page analysis released in June. The dense title suggests it’s a product of science rather than sound-byte politicians: ""Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Federal Implementation Plans to Reduce Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone in 27 States; Correction of SIP Approvals for 22 States."" The report relied on the work of EPA scientists and a survey of independent, peer-reviewed studies by outside scientists. And there, listed among the ""key findings"" is this: ""The benefits result primarily from 13,000 to 34,000 fewer (particulate matter) and ozone-related premature mortalities."" The report repeats the number eight more times. We find that Blumenauer was on solid ground. But he also  cherry-picked the highest death number rather than using the range of 13,000 to 34,000 additional deaths. While that omission does not change the conclusion that air pollution is bad for public health, it could exaggerate the problem.

1171,13367,"Hillary Clinton ""supports unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding.","October 9, 2016",False: Ted Cruz claim that Hillary Clinton backs 'unlimited abortion' to moment of birth,W. Gardner Selby,"Ted Cruz of Texas stirred an Austin crowd by declaring that Hillary Clinton favors abortion without limit. The Republican senator characterized the Democratic presidential nominee’s position after an audience member at the September 2016 Texas Tribune Festival asked why the father of two young girls could support ""a candidate who is so openly misogynistic,"" referring to Cruz’s endorsement the day before of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Cruz stressed his concerns about entrusting Clinton with nominating Supreme Court justices who would, he said, threaten his daughters’ constitutional rights. When he paused, the audience member voiced another question: ""Like the right to choose?"" Cruz replied that the ""right to life"" needs to be protected, adding: ""I can also tell you even on the question of the right to life that the views of Hillary Clinton on abortion are radical and extreme. Her views: She supports unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding."" Unlimited to the moment of birth? Readers asked us to check this claim. For starters, it’s worth noting that abortions in the weeks leading up to birth are rare; 91 percent in 2012 occurred before the 14th week of pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based reproductive health nonprofit. That year, the institute says, 1.3 percent took place in the 21st week or later. Notably too, as of October 2016, Texas ranked among 15 states to have proscribed abortion after about 20 weeks post-fertilization, the institute says. It’s also so that abortions earlier in pregnancy aren’t always available on short notice. Twenty-eight states have statutory waiting periods for an abortion, PolitiFact Ohio noted in August 2016, and 14 states require physician counseling that necessitates two trips to a medical facility prior to an abortion. Clinton through the years And how does Clinton herself characterize her abortion position? We perused her own statements and one of her votes as a New York senator. A January 2016 ""fact sheet"" on her campaign website states that as president, Clinton will ensure the right to choose an abortion is protected, a reference to the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion. Also, the sheet says, Clinton will ""repeal the Hyde amendment to ensure low-income women have access to safe reproductive health care."" That's potentially a call for more federally funded abortions in that the Hyde amendment, regularly embraced by Congress since 1976, bars government funding of abortion through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or to save the health or life of the mother. According to a 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, similar ""restrictions affect the appropriations for other federal entities, including the Department of Justice, where federal funds may not be used to perform abortions in the federal prison system, except in cases of rape or if the life of the mother would be endangered."" Hyde acts as a rider on federal appropriations bills. As such, PolitiFact Ohio noted in August 2016, it doesn’t have to be ""repealed"" to be deactivated. Bills on federal spending could just cease to include it. Some states have Hyde-like restrictions on their Medicaid dollars, and would have to change their guidelines to open an avenue to fund abortions if Hyde disappeared at the federal level. Clinton has long said that she’d support a late-term limit on abortion--provided it has exceptions. In 2003, as a senator for New York, Clinton was on the losing end of a 64-33 floor vote to advance the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 later signed into law by President George W. Bush. That change--barring physicians from knowingly performing intact dilation and extraction on a living fetus--had no exception to preserve the health or life of the woman. ""Clearly, the administration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle see this as an opportunity to begin to eliminate Roe v. Wade,"" Clinton said at the time, according to an NPR news report, ""and the possibility of safe, legal and rare abortions in this country. And many young women don't seem to understand that this is not an option that they can take for granted."" Earlier, in an Oct. 8, 2000, candidate debate, Clinton said: ""I have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected. I’ve met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it’s a horrible procedure. No one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman’s choice."" In March 2016, more recently, Bret Baier of Fox News asked Clinton during a Democratic presidential town hal whether she favors legal restrictions on abortion at any stage of pregnancy. That exchange: BAIER: ""Do you think a child should have any legal rights or protections before it’s born? Or do you think there should not be any restrictions on any abortions at any stage in a pregnancy?""",false,"Abortion, Texas, Ted Cruz, "

So-called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against HIV can cut the risk of getting the virus during sex by more than 90 percent, according to clinical studies. NHS (National Health Service) England had argued it was not in a position to fund the medicine because PrEP was a preventative service and therefore the responsibility of local authorities. The NHS lost that argument in an initial court case in August, prompting the appeal. “We are delighted to have been vindicated by the court a second time,” said Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust (NAT), which brought the case. The NAT argues that PrEP is a potential game-changer and is urgently needed in Britain, where more than 4,000 people acquire HIV annually. NHS England said it would now formally consider whether to fund PrEP. It noted the court ruling established that the NHS had the ability but not the obligation to pay for the medicine. Gilead Sciences’ Truvada is currently the only drug approved in Europe for PrEP, although several generic companies in India make cut-price versions of the product. The original Gilead drug costs around 400 pounds ($500) for a month’s supply and its unavailability on the state health service has prompted some people to turn to online “buyers clubs” to get cheaper copies delivered from India. NHS England said it would ask Gilead to reconsider its current “excessively high pricing” and would also explore options for using generics. “We expect to be able to update on these developments shortly,” it said in a statement. Gilead said it welcomed the appeal court decision and hoped NHS England would make PrEP available as soon as possible. It had no comment on the call for lower Truvada prices. Use of PrEP is rising fast in the United States, where tens of thousands of people are now taking it to prevent infection. It is also being rolled out in other parts of Europe. Truvada is a combination of two antiretroviral drugs that work to keep HIV, which causes AIDS, from replicating in the body.",true,Health News

1174,27406,A Fresno man turned up at a local emergency room carrying a 5-foot-long tapeworm he pulled out of his own intestine.,"January 19, 2018","If you’re not confident your favorite sushi restaurant sources and handles its fish in accordance with the law, we trust our little cautionary tale will inspire you to seek out one that does.",David Emery,"In January 2018, readers notified us that a number of news outlets had reported that a man in Fresno, California, had walked into a local emergency room carrying a 5-foot-long tapeworm he said he had pulled out of his own body after experiencing symptoms that included cramping and bloody diarrhea. According to the reports, the patient, a frequent sushi eater, extracted the parasite as best he could after feeling it “wiggling” in his intestines and wrapped it around a toilet paper tube for transport. He presented it to doctors at Fresno’s Community Regional Medical Center and requested immediate treatment for “worms.” We decided to check the story out for ourselves by contacting the person named as the attending physician, Dr. Kenny Banh. It’s all true, Dr. Banh told us, right down to the toilet paper roll. “I have seen and treated intestinal worms and parasites before, but never had a patient bring in a giant tapeworm,” he said in an e-mail. By “giant” he means five-and-a-half feet long. The tapeworm had a flat, skinny body, tan in color, with narrow, dark brown lines down its back and “a big, flat head.” Tapeworms are a type of parasitic flatworm (also called cestode) most often taken into the body by eating contaminated raw meat or fish. They reside in the digestive tracts of infected human beings or nonhuman animals, where they hold themselves in place using the suckers on their heads, and they may or may not cause noticeable symptoms ranging from abdominal discomfort to intestinal blockage. They can grow to more than 30 feet in length. What was Banh’s first thought when he saw the creature? “Very cool,” he said. “People asked if it was disgusting, but as an EM physician I see much worse. This was more geeky scientifically interesting — though funny, as it was wrapped around a toilet paper roll.” Treatment for tapeworms in humans is fairly simple: usually a single dose of an oral antihelminthic, a drug that kills the worms, “similar to the deworming medication you give your pet dog,” Banh says. Of greater concern to the patient was figuring out how he contracted the tapeworm in the first place. He hadn’t been exposed to parasitic infection by travel, or by drinking contaminated liquids, or by eating raw meat, he was sure — which really only left one possibility: sushi. The patient said he eats a lot of sushi — daily, in fact — and his favorite dish is salmon sashimi. A bit of Googling confirmed that he was probably right. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a research letter in January 2017 noting that the Japanese broad tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense) has been detected in wild salmon caught along the U.S. and Asian Pacific coasts and that it therefore poses “potential dangers for persons who eat these fish raw.” For any salmon sashimi addicts reading this, that doesn’t mean you have give up your habit on pain of contracting a tapeworm infection, but it does mean you need to make sure the raw salmon you consume has been handled properly. Freezing kills parasites, which is why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that all fish be frozen before it can be served raw anywhere in the United States.",true,"Medical, Emergency Room, sushi, tapeworms"

But if mitigation strategies are implemented that are able to shield the elderly via a 60% reduction in social contacts, and slow but not interrupt transmission of the disease with a 40% reduction in social contacts for the wider population, that disease burden could be cut in half, saving 20 million lives. “But we predict that even in this scenario, health systems in all countries will be quickly overwhelmed,” said the report, the 12th study by this research team since the new coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, China in December. “This effect is likely to be most severe in lower income settings where (health service) capacity is lowest.”  The researchers, led by Neil Ferguson, a professor of mathematical biology, said their analysis suggests healthcare demand worldwide can only be kept within manageable levels with  “the rapid adoption of public health measures ... similar to those being adopted in many countries” - including testing and isolation of cases and wider social distancing measures. Ferguson’s 10th study, published earlier this month, was seen as a key influencing factor on moves governments in Britain and Europe took to increase social distancing measures and tighten lockdowns in an effort to slow the expansion of the pandemic. The study, a mathematical modeling analysis which uses data and estimates to predict potential outcomes, found that in a best case scenario, if countries around the world implement suppression strategies early and sustain them, some 38.7 million lives could be saved. “Suppression strategies will need to be maintained in some manner until vaccines or effective treatments become available to avoid the risk of later epidemics,” Ferguson’s team wrote in a summary of their study’s findings. “Delays in implementing strategies to suppress transmission will lead to worse outcomes and fewer lives saved,” they added.",true,Health News

SB 239 is supported by a massive public health coalition, including almost every HIV advocacy organization, including the Black Coalition on AIDS, Positive Women’s Network, APLA Health, the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and many others.",Arturo Garcia,"On 13 September 2017, YourNewsWire.com posted a story regarding a state legislative bill in California that contradicted itself within the first two paragraphs: California Governor Jerry Brown is expected to give a green light to a bill allowing HIV positive people to knowingly expose their blood to others. The bill, SB 239, will reduce the penalties for knowingly exposing someone to HIV without telling them, allowing HIV positive people to donate their blood to others. Lawmakers claim the current felony charge for the crime is ‘discriminatory.’ The measure, which was approved by the state Senate on 11 September 2017, does indeed reduce the penalties for HIV-positive people who knowingly expose others to the virus or donate blood. But as the state legislature’s website stated, doing so is still illegal: The bill would instead make the intentional transmission of an infectious or communicable disease, as defined, a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 6 months if certain circumstances apply, including that the defendant knows he or she or a 3rd party is afflicted with the disease, that the defendant acts with the specific intent to transmit or cause an afflicted 3rd party to transmit the disease to another person, that the defendant or the afflicted 3rd party engages in conduct that poses a substantial risk of transmission, as defined, that the defendant or the afflicted 3rd party transmits the disease to the other person, and if the exposure occurs through interaction with the defendant and not a 3rd party, that the person exposed to the disease during voluntary interaction with the defendant did not know that the defendant was afflicted with the disease. The bill would also make it a misdemeanor to attempt to intentionally transmit an infectious and communicable disease, as specified, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 90 days. This bill would make willful exposure to an infectious or communicable disease, as defined, a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 6 months, and would prohibit a health officer, or a health officer’s designee, from issuing a maximum of 2 instructions to a defendant that would result in a violation of this provision. The bill would impose various requirements upon the court in order to prevent the public disclosure of the identifying characteristics, as defined, of the complaining witness and the defendant. By creating new crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Brown signed the bill into law on 6 October 2017. Before then, knowingly exposing a person to the virus via sexual contact was a felony punishable by either three, five, or eight years in prison. It was also a felony for an HIV-positive person to knowingly “donate blood, tissue, or, under specified circumstances, semen or breast milk.” Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener, who introduced the bill, told us in an e-mail on 18 September 2017: Sexual assault will remain a felony, regardless of HIV status. So if someone with HIV sexually assaults someone, that will be continue to be a felony. In addition, SB 239 does not repeal the HIV-related sentencing enhancement for sexual assaults. The goal of the bill, Wiener said, was to end HIV infections: SB 239 will make it more likely that people will get tested for HIV and seek treatment, by removing stigma. Criminalizing health conditions harms public health. Criminalizing HIV makes it less likely people will get tested. If an HIV infection occurs, we need to make sure that people have access to healthcare. The bill passed in the state Senate by a margin of 24-12 (with four lawmakers abstaining) four days after the state assembly approved it in a 52-19 vote (with eight members abstaining). One of the bill’s critics, Republican Sen. Joel Anderson said: I’m of the mind that if you purposefully inflict another with a disease that alters their lifestyle the rest of their life, puts them on a regiment of medications to maintain any kind of normalcy, it should be a felony. It’s absolutely crazy to me that we should go light on this. However, a 28 June 2017 editorial by two Alameda County Public Health Department officials argued that intentional exposure to the virus is rare. J. Phoenix Smith (interim head of the department’s HIV care unit) and Nicholas J. Moss (director of its HIV STD Section) wrote: Of note, a careful examination of hundreds cases revealed only two cases of actual intentional HIV transmission — nationwide, over more than 30 years. Wiener and the bill’s sponsor in the Assembly, Democratic lawmaker Todd Gloria, said in a statement that the bill is supported by several LGBTQ and HIV-related advocacy groups, including the Center for HIV Law & Policy, the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, and the San Francisco AIDS Foundation among others. But another HIV activist, Deondre B. Moore, said in a March 2017 post for the group HIV Equal that the bill should be revised. In his piece, Moore reveals that a partner infected him with the virus after lying to him about testing negative. While he does not feel having HIV is a “death sentence,” he said, his peace of mind was stolen by his former partner’s behavior: No one deserves a pass. It’s one thing to be positive and be in control of your health by engaging in care and maintaining an undetectable viral load. It’s another thing to just not care and intentionally aim to infect others with HIV. Something should be done and justice should always be served. I believe that SB 239 should be revised to note that, a person with a proven undetectable viral load should not be penalized or have to face consequences for having unprotected sex and not disclosing their status. However, a person who is positive and is proven to be intentionally infecting or aiming to infect others should face felony charges and brought to justice.

However, under the new policy, schools need not make more progress toward those goals for another three years. In addition, the current standards don’t allow flavored 1 percent milk, and the new policy states that the department wants to change that through an interim rule. So the standards might not have changed yet, but Perdue said he plans to do so.",Jon Greenberg,"Agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue went to an elementary school lunchroom in Virginia to announce new rules for the food schools serve. Under the banner of trimming the childhood obesity rate, combatting rising levels of diabetes and other health problems, Congress passed and the Obama administration implemented new targets for schools. Perdue gave schools more time to comply in two areas -- whole grains and sodium levels -- and expanded the rules for milk. ""We're giving these food service professionals the flexibility to move as we get a healthier generation,"" Perdue said May 1. ""This is not reducing nutritional standards whatsoever. It's pausing here to evaluate whether or not the progressive standards of moving even further are appropriate or not."" Perdue argued that if kids don’t like what they’re offered, they simply won’t eat it, and giving schools more time to comply would help children get more of the nutrition they need. We focus here on Perdue’s claim that his move does not reduce nutritional standards. Is it true that they do no reduce nutritional standards set by the department in 2012 ""whatsoever?"" While Perdue is technically correct about not reducing the standards, his department will not be enforcing them. ""He is not changing the standards per se, but he is allowing schools to not follow them,"" said nutrition policy researcher David Pelletier at Cornell University. ""It’s a bit like saying the posted speed limits on the roads remain the same, but you can go as fast as you want."" The starting point Washington’s school lunch program reaches about 30 million kids every day at a yearly cost of about $11 billion. To qualify for federal support, schools must meet a number of dietary regulations. In 2012, the Agriculture Department announced the final version of Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. For milk, schools could provide ""flavor in fat-free milk only."" By 2015, all grain products, such as bread, oatmeal and noodles had to be ""whole grain-rich."" That term meant that at least half was whole grain and the rest could be processed but enriched with vitamins and minerals. The rule for reducing sodium, or salt, was more complicated and set increasingly lower targets that varied slightly by age group. So for example, by July 2014, a lunch for an elementary student couldn’t contain more than 1,230 mg of sodium, which is about 65 percent of the upper limit for a full day as set in the Federal Dietary Guidelines. By July 2017, the target became 50 percent of the daily limit, and by July 2022, the target went down to about 33 percent. Making 'school meals great again' Perdue’s office sent out a press release entitled ""Ag Secretary Perdue Moves to Make School Meals Great Again."" It said the department would start the process to allow schools to start serving 1 percent flavored milk. At the elementary school event, Perdue said, ""I wouldn't be as big as I am today without chocolate milk."" For grains, schools could apply for exemptions to the whole grain-rich content rule through 2020. On sodium, any school meeting the first target for lunches of about 65 percent of the daily limit would be considered in compliance through 2020. In a statement, the department said this was similar to a 2016 memo from the Obama Agriculture Department. That memo said it recognized that manufacturers had lagged in cutting down the salt in food, and so schools ""that are working toward compliance"" would not suffer if they hadn’t yet made the grade. Perdue’s policy is more lenient, declaring that no school need push beyond the first target while, as Perdue said, the department pauses ""to evaluate whether or not the progressive standards of moving even further are appropriate or not."" Were nutrition standards reduced? For whole grains and sodium, the new policy extends the timeline for achieving those standards, but so far, the overall goals remain -- with the option to reassess later. Pelletier of Cornell and nutrition policy researcher Joann Slavin at the University of Minnesota both said the underlying nutrition standards are unchanged. But Pelletier called Perdue's statement a ""semantic trick."" The situation with milk is a little trickier. The 2012 rules, which match the recommendations from a 2009 National Academy of Sciences panel, said flavored milk had to be non-fat. Perdue hasn’t officially changed that yet, but he said ""USDA will seek to publish an interim rule as soon as possible to effect the change in milk policy,"" to allow flavored 1 percent milk. Slavin said the federal rules on milk went too far. That said, they were published as nutritional standards and followed the guidance from an independent research group. Our ruling Perdue said his changes to the school lunch requirements did not reduce nutritional standards. The plain facts and the assessment of experts confirm that the long term goals for whole grains and sodium remain in place for now. However, under the new policy, schools need not make more progress toward those goals for another three years.

They honked their horns and held up signs in their car windows, footage on social media seen by Reuters showed. Polish women’s rights groups also called for Poles to protest on their balconies, in shopping queues and by putting posters in their windows. Police, using loud speakers, warned demonstrators they could be held criminally liable if they flouted lockdown rules. Abortion rights are a contentious issue in Poland, with the conservative ruling Law and Justice (PiS) keen to curb the nation’s already restricted access further, despite significant public opposition. Parliament is set to decide later this week whether to debate a proposal submitted for its consideration by anti-abortion activists. It is unclear whether the PiS, which controls the legislature, will back it, however. The party, which campaigns on introducing more religious values into public life, has previously retreated from proposals to nearly ban abortion after a massive public outcry. Campaigners say it would face renewed criticism if it pushed through legislation when restrictions on public life because of the coronavirus pandemic prohibit large-scale demonstrations. “The chaos and anxiety surrounding COVID-19 shouldn’t be used as a distraction from harmful attempts to push through dangerous legislation,” Hillary Margolis, senior women’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, one of the world’s largest human rights groupings, said on Tuesday. “The Polish government’s focus during the pandemic should be to protect people’s health and rights, not diminish them.”  For the PiS, a tough stance against abortion could bolster its support among the conservative electorate ahead of a presidential election scheduled for May 10. Its incumbent, Andrzej Duda, is leading in opinion polls. Under current rules, abortion is allowed in Poland in the case of rape, incest and risks to maternal health or if prenatal tests show serious, irreversible damage to the foetus. The new proposal would eliminate foetal health as an exception, which accounts for the vast majority of legal abortions conducted in Poland. “I believe that killing disabled children is simply murder,” Duda, a PiS ally, told Catholic news outlet Niedziela, earlier this month when asked about the proposal. “If legislation about this crosses my desk, I will certainly sign it into law,” he said. The abortion imitative, alongside a proposal to criminalise sex education in schools, was submitted during parliament’s previous term, before the October 2015 general election, which the PiS won. It must be reviewed by May, according to parliamentary rules. The Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights Dunja Mijatovic on Tuesday also urged parliament to reject the two bills, saying they could restrict women’s rights to safe and legal abortions and children’s rights to sex education. A spokesman as well as PiS members of parliament contacted by Reuters did not respond to requests for comment. #RatujmyKobiety, which translates as #Rescue Women, was one of the trending hashtags on Twitter in Poland on Tuesday.",true,Health News
1185,615,"'You have stolen my dreams,' an angry Thunberg tells U.N. climate summit.","March 17, 2015","Teenage activist Greta Thunberg angrily denounced world leaders on Monday for failing to tackle climate change, unleashing the outrage felt by millions of her peers in the heart of the United Nations by demanding: “How dare you?”","Valerie  Volcovici, Matthew Green","The Swedish campaigner’s brief address electrified the start of a summit aimed at mobilising government and business to break international paralysis over carbon emissions, which hit record highs last year despite decades of warnings from scientists. “This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?” said Thunberg, 16, her voice quavering with emotion. “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,” she said. Inspired by Thunberg’s solitary weekly protest outside the Swedish parliament a year ago, millions of young people poured onto the streets around the globe last Friday to demand governments attending the summit take emergency action. “I was very struck by the emotion in the room when some of the young people spoke earlier,” French President Emmanuel Macron told the U.N. Climate Action Summit. “I also want to play my role in listening to them. I think that no political decision maker can remain deaf to this call for justice between generations.”  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who organised the one-day event to boost the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming, had warned leaders only to turn up if they came armed with concrete action plans, not empty speeches. “Nature is angry. And we fool ourselves if we think we can fool nature, because nature always strikes back, and around the world nature is striking back with fury,” said Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister. “There is a cost to everything. But the biggest cost is doing nothing. The biggest cost is subsidising a dying fossil fuel industry, building more and more coal plants, and denying what is plain as day: that we are in a deep climate hole, and to get out we must first stop digging,” he said. Nevertheless, there were few new proposals from governments for the kind of rapid change climate scientists say is now needed to avert devastating impacts from warming. The summit has, by contrast, been marked by a flurry of pledges from business, pension funds, insurers and banks to do more. “We have broken the cycle of life,” said Emmanuel Faber, chief executive of French food group Danone (DANO.PA), who announced a “One Planet” initiative with a group of 19 major food companies to transition towards more sustainable farming. “We need your support for shifting agricultural subsidies from killing life into supporting biodiversity,” Faber said. U.S. President Donald Trump, who questions climate science and has challenged every major U.S. regulation aimed at combating climate change, made a brief appearance in the audience of the summit along with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He did not speak but he listened to remarks by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who serves as a U.N. special envoy on climate action, called out Trump’s low-key appearance before he spoke on Monday: “Hopefully our deliberations will be helpful to you as you formulate climate policy,” he said to audience laughter. Merkel announced Germany would double its contribution to a U.N. fund to support less developed countries to combat climate change to 4 billion euros from 2 billion euros. Among the day’s other initial announcements was one from the Marshall Islands, whose president Hilda Heine said she would seek parliamentary approval to declare a climate crisis on the low-lying atoll, already grappling with sea level rise. Heine said her country and New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and others who form the “High Ambition” bloc at U.N. climate negotiations, will commit to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. With climate impacts such as extreme weather, thawing permafrost and sea-level rise unfolding much faster than expected, scientists say the urgency of the crisis has intensified since the Paris accord was agreed. The agreement will enter a crucial implementation phase next year after another round of negotiations in Chile in December. Existing pledges to curb emissions are nowhere near enough to avert catastrophic warming, say scientists, who warn that failing to change course could ultimately put the survival of industrial societies at risk. Laurence Tubiana, a former French diplomat and an architect of the Paris accord, said she drew some comfort from more ambitious pledges by a nucleus of political and business leaders. “When you look at the emergency and you see the level of the response, of course I cannot be happy,” Tubiana told reporters. “The golden nugget I see is this group of countries, companies and cities.”  Over the past year, Guterres has called for no new coal plants to be built after 2020, urged a phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies and asked countries to map out how to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. While some countries have made progress, some of the biggest emitting countries remain far behind, even as wildfires, heat waves and record temperatures have provided glimpses of the devastation that could lie in store in a warmer world. In a measure of the gap between government action and the ever-louder alarms sounded by climate scientists, the United Nations Development Programme said that 14 nations representing a quarter of global emissions have signalled that they do not intend to revise current climate plans by 2020. Pope Francis, in a message broadcast to the conference,  called for honesty, responsibility and courage to face “one of the most serious and worrying phenomena of our time”.",true,Environment
1188,33885,"David Attenborough said that ""I am unaware of any animal that is as cruel as Israelis"" as part of a scathing attack on the country's treatment of the Palestinian people.","September 19, 2018","Sir David Attenborough is a household name in the U.K. and a hugely-respected broadcaster whose pronouncements are closely followed and widely reported in the news media. If he had weighed in on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially in a way which asserted that Israelis were worse than animals, such comments would certainly have made headline news. No such news coverage exists, though, because Attenborough never made any such comments.",Dan MacGuill,"Between 2014 and 2018, a quotation emerged online which purported to show the English broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough comparing Israeli people to ‘animals’ for their alleged treatment of the Palestinians. Attenborough’s alleged statement was turned into a meme which read as follows: I am not aware of any animal that is so cruel as the Israelis — not even crocodiles. They bomb schools, hospitals, refugee camps, orphanages, UN feeding stations, water works, power plants, ambulances, kids playing on the beach. They put millions of people in siege. They shoot children going to school. They kidnap kids and harvest their organs. They inject prisoners with disease pathogens before releasing them. They murder by land sea and air. And worst of all, they slander their defenceless victims as “terrorists”. David Attenborough, July 21st 2014. These words also appear on lists of “David Attenborough quotes” and were prominently cited by the Indian journalist Aijaz Zaka Syed in an August 2014 column he wrote for the Saudi newspaper Arab News on the subject of Israel’s then ongoing “Operation Protective Edge” in Gaza. Syed prefaced the quotation with “As an agitated David Attenborough, the celebrated British environmentalist, noted …” The quotation has almost always appeared with a specific date attached to it: “July 21st, 2014.” It’s possible the date was used to add to the statement’s appearance of authenticity — not only did Attenborough say these things, the logic goes, but we know exactly when he said them. However, the inclusion of this date actually allows us to conclude that the quotation is not a genuine one. On 21 July 2014, a user with the pseudonym “David Attenborough” commented under an article on the Iranian news web site PressTV. That article has since been removed, but an archived version shows that the headline proclaimed “Israel drops white phosphorus bombs on Gazans,” and in the comments section of that article a “David Attenborough” wrote: I am unaware of any animal that is as cruel as Israelis — not even crocodiles. They bomb schools, hospitals, refugee camps, orphanages, UN feeding stations, water works, power plants, ambulances, kids playing on the beach. They put millions of people in a siege. They shoot children going to school. They kidnap kids and harvest their organs. They inject prisoners with disease pathogens before releasing them. They murder by land sea and air. And worst of all, they slander their defenceless victims as “terrorists”. The distinctive date and time format from this comment (“5:8 PM”) was carried over into some later versions of the meme, which establishes that the 2014 PressTV article was the original source of this quotation. One version of the meme even falsely described Attenborough as an MP (member of parliament), further undermining its credibility:  Attenborough did not say those things about Israel. The date and time included with the quotation since its emergence online establishes that it originated with a comment made by an unknown person using the moniker “David Attenborough” on an Iranian news web site.",false,"Politics, David Attenborough, israel, middle east"
1189,9751,Testing for more breast cancer genes offers useful information,"August 18, 2015","This story does a nice job of describing a recent study that looked at the clinical validity of several cancer genetic test panels. The study looked at a group of women who were very high risk for breast cancer but tested negative for the BRCA1/2 genes and who were tested for other, potentially high-risk genes. It describes the potential harms associated with such test panels, touches on the authors’ reported conflicts of interest, and avoids disease mongering. It could have done better by specifying costs, interviewing independent experts, and by putting this evidence in context — explaining some general issues with genetic testing and their analytical as well as clinical validity. About 5-10% of breast cancer cases in the US are linked to hereditary genetic mutations, the two best-known mutations being BRCA1 and BRCA2. Mutations in dozens of other genes have been studied and identified as possible risk factors for breast cancer. Myriad Genetics owned a patent on these two tests until 2013, when the Supreme Court ruled that genes couldn’t be patented, thus invalidating their patents and their status as the only company that could offer BRCA1/2 genetic testing. Since this ruling, other companies have begun to offer multiple genetic test panels that are now marketed to doctors and to patients alike. The main question behind these, and other (including non-cancer), genetic tests is what to do with the information generated by them. Are identified genetic mutations “clinically actionable”? Are the results meaningful enough to allow the medical team to alter or tailor clinical management? The availability of various panels of genetic tests, for cancer as well as for other diseases, has been controversial in the medical community. At issue are the “analytical validity” of the test (Can the test accurately detect whether a specific genetic variant is present or absent? ), as well as the “clinical validity” of the test (Can the test provide information about diagnosis, treatment, management, or prevention of a disease that will be helpful to a patient or to a consumer?)","Ranit Mishori, MD, MHS, FAAFP,Deanna Attai, MD, FACS,Kevin Lomangino","The article mentions that the tests themselves “are not more expensive than testing for the BRCA mutations alone,” but it doesn’t state what those BRCA-only panels cost. In addition, insurance coverage for panel testing is not as uniform as it is for BRCA 1/2 testing. There are established guidelines for BRCA 1/2 testing from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network that most insurance companies honor. There are not yet established guidelines for panel testing. We appreciate the nod to cost, but we thought a little bit more detail was needed here for a Satisfactory rating. The story relays the benefits described in the study for the study population. It notes that 63 (about 4%) out of more than 1,000 women who test negative for BRCA mutations tested positive for non-BRCA mutations. “Of those, the researchers decided that 33 would have been considered for additional screening or prevention measures based on their results.” That description earns to the story a Satisfactory rating. Additional details on what screening and prevention measures might be recommended for which women — and some statement about whether those results are likely to apply to people outside of the study — would have been welcome. Potential harms, including having uncertain results leading to psychological difficulties, were mentioned in a quote from the lead author, who also discussed the complexity of interpreting the results. The article also quoted him as saying that misinterpretation could potentially lead to “a drastic, unnecessary surgical procedure”. The story describes the evidence as presented in the original article and includes some restraining comments from the researchers about the complexity of interpreting the tests and the fact that they are not advocating for broad-based testing. However, there are various major questions and issues related to genetic test panels themselves, including their “analytic validity”  (the degree of accuracy with which a test detects the presence or absence of a mutation), and “clinical validity” (how well the mutation is related to the presence, absence, or risk of a specific disease), which are not mentioned. We would like to have seen those terms – key issues when reporting on the utility of genetic testing — mentioned and discussed somewhere in the article. (Or if not those specific terms then the issues that they are meant to describe.) This is important because this study looked at two specific panels, but gene mutations included in some other tests may have uncertain analytic/clinical validity. Related to these issues, the story doesn’t clarify that while the management of the women with positive “panel” test results might have changed because of the result, it’s not clear from this study whether their ultimate outcome (e.g. rate of cancer diagnoses or survival) was improved or to what extent because of the additional testing. Finally, it would have been great to see mention of the CDC’s ACCE model which is a “publicly-available analytical process for evaluating scientific data on emerging genetic tests”. There was no disease mongering here. Breast cancer is a real concern to many women. The article mentions that several of the study’s authors have links to the industry and to companies that produce the genetic test panels. The story also quotes from an editorial written by an expert who wasn’t involved with the study. Conducting an interview with an outside expert might have unearthed additional useful context, but the story is pretty solid here as it stands. The piece in itself is about an investigation of the clinical usefulness of additional (alternative) genetic panels to the “routine” BRCA1/2 tests. So the story meets our standard here. But as mentioned before, there are serious concerns about the use and availability of genetic test panels and it would have been great to add some context. Although availability isn’t explicitly addressed, the story does note that women and their physicians are “ordering a wide selection of multiplex tests daily,” from which one can infer that they are available. The story could have been more specific as to which panels were tested here and what others are available from physicians and even online. A good review is included in a table in this recent article from the NEJM. The novelty of the research — the fact that there’s now some evidence that these tests may provide actionable information — is discussed. It would have been great to put this research and the tests themselves in context with recent legal and scientific advances in the field. The story references an interview with the study’s lead author, so we can be sure it went beyond this news release issued about the study.",true,"BRCA,breast cancer,genetic testing"

Do they really prefer root canals, traffic jams and colonoscopies over this branch of government? Really? That’s Arnold Schwarzenegger’s colorful claim from a February 2017 video that went viral. He repeated the allegations in an April 12, 2017 post on Facebook. In the video, he points out the deep disdain for Congress but also notes that nearly all members are re-elected due to what Schwarzenegger calls a rigged political redistricting system, or gerrymandering. Here’s his claim in its raw form: ""Here are some of the things that are more popular than Congress: hemorrhoids, Nickelback, traffic jams, cockroaches, root canals, colonoscopies, herpes. Even herpes, they couldn’t beat herpes in the polls."" The former California governor and movie star has vowed to raise awareness about gerrymandering now that’s he’s finished as host of The New Celebrity Apprentice and squashed rumors he might run for U.S. Senate. While we know approval ratings for Congress are low, we wondered if they’re really as pathetic as Schwarzenegger wants us to believe. We set out on a fact check. Our research This isn’t the first time we’ve checked Schwarzenegger’s claims on Congress and gerrymandering. In February, we rated his assertion that, ""The average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%."" He was referring to the average percentage point victory for both Democrats and Republicans in the 2016 election. We asked Schwarzenegger’s spokesman for evidence backing up his claim about Congress’ pitiful popularity. He pointed to results from surveys conducted by Public Policy Polling in January 2013 and October 2013. The polling company is known for conducting some tongue-in-cheek surveys and works with liberal clients. In the polls on Congress’ popularity, it asked hundreds of registered voters if they have a higher opinion of either Congress or a series of unpleasant or disliked things. Before we tackle those results, let’s look at Congress’ overall approval ratings in these recent PPP polls: -- January 2013: Congress’s overall favorability rating among voters was just 9 percent favorable and 85 percent unfavorable. -- October 2013: Congress’ overall favorability rating dipped slightly to 8  percent favorable with the same 85 percent unfavorable. -- March 2017: Congress’ overall favorability rating nudged up to 11 percent with only 68 percent of voters disapproving of it. Now, let’s tackle those head-to-head results: Hemorrhoids -- 53 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of hemorrhoids than Congress, which was favored by only 31 percent in this matchup, according to the October 2013 survey Nickelback -- 39 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of the rock band Nickelback than Congress, which was favored by only 32 percent Traffic jams -- 56 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of traffic jams, than Congress, which was favored by only 34 percent Root canals -- 56 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of this dental procedure than Congress, which was favored by only 32 percent Colonoscopies -- 58 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of this invasive procedure than Congress, which was favored by only 31 percent Herpes The PPP surveys didn’t ask about herpes. It did ask, however, about gonorrhea. And Congress was still less popular than that venereal disease. A spokesman for the company that produced Schwarzenegger’s video pointed to a 2011 CNN op-ed where comedian and radio show host Dean Obeidallah claimed Congress was less popular than herpes, without citing evidence.

In August 2016, someone issued a hoax “leak” of purported medical records from Dr. Bardack supposedly documenting that, contrary to what the physician had asserted in public, Hillary Clinton was experiencing “more frequent” seizures and showed signs of “advancing” dementia. Shortly afterwards, the notorious conspiracy-pushing outlet WhatDoesItMean.com  published a fabricated article reporting that Vincent Fleck, the “father of the doctor treating [Hillary Clinton] for dementia” and the “leaker” of those records, had died under mysterious circumstances: The Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is reporting today that the continuing to grow list of mysterious deaths surrounding US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has increased after the father of the doctor treating her for dementia suddenly died this past weekend — and who is believed to have been behind the leaking of her most secret medical records. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.] The SVR first became “alerted/alarmed” regarding the circumstances of this latest mysterious death associated with Hillary Clinton on 17 July, this report says, when a “known/suspected” Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) “hit team” traveled about 70 kilometers (44 miles) from their New York City “base/headquarters” to a small village named Mount Kisco, both being located in New York State. Upon arriving in Mount Kisco, this report continues, this CIA “hit team” broke into a specialized small computer security companies annex office named Right Click Solutions, located at 322 East Main Street, but were “shocked/surprised” by the unexpected arrival of an off duty employee — who immediately called the local police forces when he noticed the break in — and who were only able to obtain a single laptop computer. An “electronic interrogation” of this company and its customers to ascertain the CIA’s interest in it, this report says, revealed an anomaly where this computer security company had installed a “Snowden-like dead man’s switch” on the personal computer of man named Vincent Fleck. [Note: The “dead man’s switch” refered to by the SVR in this report relates to a software programme that will automatically distribute information should something happen to the owner.] It is true that news accounts reported the death of a Vincent Fleck of Mount Kisco, who passed away from drowning or a medical event suffered while competing in a triathalon in early August 2016. However, all the rest of the story about a CIA “hit team” finding a “dead man’s switch” on Vincent Fleck’s computer is a fabrication, as is the claim about Dr. Daniel Fleck’s treating Hillary Clinton for dementia. (It’s rather unlikely a physical therapist with a regular practice specializing in sports injuries would be furtively treating a high-profile politician campaigning throughout the country for dementia.) As reflected in the example tweets reproduced above, many readers inferred that Dr. Daniel Fleck himself had died mysteriously, but we confirmed with a beleaguered employee at his practice (beset with phone calls about the conspiracy rumors) that the physician was alive and well. Vincent Fleck was the fourth individual “connected” to Clinton by WhatDoesItMean.com as part of a series of fabrications suggesting people who posed risks to Clinton’s power were being serially murdered. Previously, the outlet falsely claimed hacker Guccifer (Marcel Lazăr Lehel) was missing and presumed dead after he purportedly hacked into Clinton’s e-mail, and claimed former UN official John Ashe was murdered on the eve of scheduled testimony against Clinton. The site also used the tragic unsolved murder of Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Rich to germinate a baseless conspiracy theory that ultimately caused the young man’s family additional sorrow in an already harrowing period of grief. Guccifer was confirmed alive and well by officials at the facility in which he was housed, and a federal prosecutor’s office affirmed Ashe’s legal troubles were in no way connected to Clinton. Rich’s murder remains unsolved, but his family has pled with the public not to engage in painful speculation about the circumstances of his killing. All four rumors were started by a blogger known by the nom de plume “Sorcha Faal.”  RationalWiki says of Faal’s “sensational” and “outrageous” WhatDoesItMean.com conspiracy site that: Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of “reports” published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don’t think much of it.

1193,1587,Beer brewers toast Australian gluten-free barley.,"April 14, 2016","Australian scientists say they have developed the world’s first WHO-approved “gluten-free” barley, a breakthrough for global beer manufacturers which have had to use alternatives to barley such as rice and sorghum to brew gluten-free beer.",Colin Packham,"Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) said on Friday it had sold 70 tonnes of the new Kebari barley to Germany’s largest brewer Radeberger, which has produced a beer to be sold in local supermarkets. “Gluten-free barley will be highly sought after, with European brewers particularly interested,” said John O’Brien, a brewer of gluten-free beer in Melbourne. Gluten-free is one of the world’s fastest growing consumer trends with the market expected to grow more than 10 percent a year until 2020 to be worth $7.59 billion, a 2015 report by MarketsandMarket estimated. European drinkers, already among the world’s largest consumers of beer per capita, have embraced gluten-free more than other regions, brewers said, with several large manufacturers releasing gluten-free brands.One of the problems brewers have faced in making gluten-free beer without barley, or barley with the gluten stripped out, is that beer drinkers often complain it doesn’t taste like traditionally brewed beer. “A true gluten-free barley variety is a true game changer, there is going to be a massive market for the product,” said Phin Ziebell, an agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank. While the new “gluten-free” Kebari barley actually contains minute amounts of gluten, the CSIRO said it had 10,000 times less gluten than traditional strains, or about 5 parts of gluten per million, well below the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 20 parts per million for classification as a gluten-free grain. Barley is primarily used for animal feed and alcohol production and the development of a “gluten-free” barley is expected to boost Australia’s ability to capitalize on the growing global gluten-free market. “As it expands, certainly some growers will benefit, this will be a premium grain,” said Phil Larkin, research manager for healthy cereals at CSIRO. The new “gluten-free” barley is part of Australia’s push to become Asia’s delicatessen, supplying premium agricultural products like finger limes, olive oil, honey, wagyu beef and organic baby food to the region’s growing middle class. While the diagnosis of gluten-related disorders such as coeliac disease has increased, the majority of consumer growth in the sector has come from non suffers. However, gluten-free beer has seen only small gains, curbed by differing global standards of what is considered gluten-free. The United States plans to tighten requirements on manufacturers of gluten-free beer to prove their claims. Kebari barley is not a product of genetically modified farming, but a decades program of breeding out the gluten by cross-breeding low gluten barley varieties, said the CSIRO. Production of the new strain of barley, which has been patented by CSIRO, will be strictly controlled within Australia, limiting farmer access to seeds, in order to prevent cross contamination, said the government-funded scientific body.",true,Science News

While there is anecdotal evidence that Zinn’s work is popular among some high-school teachers, there is zero hard evidence to support Santorum’s core statistical claim -- that Zinn’s volume is taught in more high-school history classes than any other book. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",Louis Jacobson,"A debate over high school history books doesn’t seem like the most obvious point to bring up during a speech to members of the National Rifle Association. But potential presidential candidate Rick Santorum did just that during the group’s annual convention last week. In addition to touching on gun rights issues in his speech, Santorum, a former Republican senator from Pennsylvania, criticized teachers for assigning works by the late Howard Zinn, including A People’s History of the United States, that cast a critical -- and often sharply negative -- light on the past actions of the U.S. government. ""Do you know the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America is written by a man named Howard Zinn, who is an anti-American Marxist, and that is the most common textbook?"" Santorum said in the April 10, 2015, speech. (It’s around the 10:15 mark.) We wondered whether Santorum was correct, so we took a closer look. Who was Howard Zinn? First, some background on Zinn. Zinn was born in 1922 to Eastern European immigrants and grew up in working-class Brooklyn. ""By his late teens, his reading had veered into politics, especially Marxism,"" wrote Rutgers University historian David Greenberg. Greenberg noted that historians have divided over the question of whether Zinn ever officially joined the Communist Party, but there is no doubt that his politics were -- and remained -- left-wing until his death in 2010. Zinn earned a Ph.D. in history from Columbia, taught for more than two decades at Boston University, and went on to write a number of books and plays, but A People’s History became his most famous work, selling more than 2 million copies since its publication in 1980, including various updated editions, according to Amazon.com. Zinn intended it as history from the bottom-up -- ""the Constitution from the standpoint of the slaves, of Andrew Jackson as seen by the Cherokees, of the Civil War as seen by the New York Irish ... ."" It’s a black-and-white, heroes-and-villains history of the United States in which the United States is almost always in the wrong. The book clearly hit a nerve: It became a cultural icon, name-checked on such television shows as The Sopranos and The Simpsons and receiving a prominent endorsement by Matt Damon’s character in the movie Good Will Hunting. The book also informed a number of historical documentaries and has inspired a national effort to promote his approach to history called the Zinn Education Project. So Zinn clearly has his admirers. But he also has detractors -- and they are not just conservatives. Some of Zinn’s fiercest critics have been liberals. Greenberg, writing in the liberal magazine The New Republic in 2013, called it a ""pretty lousy piece of work"" and said Zinn’s scholarly contributions were ""meager."" Zinn ""renounces the ideals of objectivity and empirical responsibility, and makes the dubious leap to the notion that a historian need only lay his ideological cards on the table and tell whatever history he chooses,"" Greenberg wrote. Even a publication of the American Federation of Teachers -- one of the nation’s two leading teachers’ unions -- ran a piece critical of Zinn by Stanford education and history professor Sam Wineburg. ""It seems that once (Zinn) made up his mind, nothing—not new evidence, not new scholarship, not the discovery of previously unknown documents, not the revelations of historical actors on their deathbeds—could shake it,"" Wineburg wrote. He added that ""history as truth, issued from the left or from the right, abhors shades of gray. It seeks to stamp out the democratic insight that people of good will can see the same thing and come to different conclusions."" What’s the evidence? We won’t take a position on the merits of Zinn’s historiography, but we will look at the evidence for whether Santorum is correct that Zinn is the author of ""the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America."" We’ll start by noting that, contrary to Santorum’s wording, A People’s History is ""not a textbook but a trade book,"" said Gilbert T. Sewall, director of the New York City-based American Textbook Council. While A People’s History might serve as supplementary material in a high school history class, ""its choices are highly idiosyncratic and it really wouldn’t do as your main text for a U.S. history survey class,"" Greenberg of Rutgers told PolitiFact. Beyond this, though, is there hard evidence that Zinn is the ""most popular"" book in high-school history classes? The short answer is no. When we asked Matt Beynon, a spokesman for Santorum, for supporting evidence, he referred us to two articles that mentioned the book but didn’t provide any hard evidence that it was the ""most popular."" Other experts also came up empty in the search for hard data. ""I have never heard anyone in our organization suggest that it is the most popular by any stretch of the definition of ‘most,’ "" said Susan Griffin, executive director of the National Council for the Social Studies, which represents high school history teachers. Peter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars, said that while he believes anecdotally that Zinn’s books are ""widely used"" in American high schools, he is unaware ""of any hard data on how often it is assigned relative to other textbooks or how popular it is compared to other historical surveys."" Sewall, of the American Textbook Council, concurred. While Zinn’s impact on social studies teachers ""is prodigious and possibly unparalleled,"" he said, ""there is no way to determine the most popular base history instructional materials used in U.S. high schools."" In an interview, Wineburg of Stanford added that ""not a single state in the union"" has put Zinn’s books on an ""approved adoption list for middle or high school. Three big companies, including the biggest, Holt-McDougal, control about 90 percent of the market. They issue conventional, 1,000-page behemoths. … Find me one instance in which Zinn appears on any one of 50 state adoption lists, and I'll find you a unicorn."" Not even Zinn’s supporters agree with the claims that his influence in high school classrooms is unmatched. Alison Kysia, who has taught history at Northern Virginia Community College and has served as a fellow with the group that co-sponsors the Zinn Education Project, has written that ""for as much as I wish"" it were true that A People’s History was the most popular history textbook used in classrooms today, ""it isn’t."" Not only is there no comprehensive study, she wrote, but the evidence of the volume’s use in college classes shows that it’s not used especially widely. Specifically, a study by Dan Cohen, the founding executive director of the Digital Public Library of America and a former historian at George Mason University, found that of 258 undergraduate U.S. history survey courses in spring 2004, only three assigned Zinn’s book. The most commonly assigned volumes were The American Promise, by Roark, Johnson, Cohen, Stage and Hartmann, and The American People: Creating a Nation and a Society, by Nash, Jeffrey, Howe Frederick, Davis, Winkler, Mires and Pestana. ""I doubt that high school is much different,"" Cohen told PolitiFact. ""There are a lot of textbooks out there, and Zinn's is a tiny fraction of the assigned books."" Anecdotal evidence So we find no evidence to support the statistical claim that Zinn’s is ""the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America."" But we do think it’s worth paying at least some attention to the broader question of whether Zinn remains influential. For starters, Zinn’s sales are still strong, even five years after his death. He ranks about 30th on Amazon.com’s list of best-selling history authors. (The ranking changes constantly based on new sales, so it’s impossible to pinpoint a specific number.) While this bit of evidence should be taken with a grain of salt -- Fox News host Bill O’Reilly ranks about 10th on the same list -- it does suggest a continuing interest in his works. Indeed, Wood of the National Association of Scholars said it’s possible to interpret Santorum’s use of the word ""popular"" as meaning best-liked, rather than most widely used. While he acknowledges that this would be impossible to test empirically, he said it’s not implausible to think that Zinn’s supporters have an unmatched level of passion for his writings. ""There really is no other history textbook that enjoys the level of enthusiasm among students as Zinn’s book enjoys,"" he said. There’s anecdotal evidence for this. Wineburg of Stanford noted in his article that ""in 2008, the National Council for the Social Studies invited Zinn to address its annual conference—the largest gathering of social studies teachers in the country. Zinn's speech met with raucous applause."" Greenberg of Rutgers, while he called Santorum’s claim ""hyperbole,"" agreed that Zinn’s works are ""influential."" ""It’s very simplistic and appeals to the high school mind,"" he said. ""I think there is a germ of truth in the conservative complaint that the academy is captive to left-wing ideas."" Our ruling Santorum said that Zinn wrote ""the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America."" While there is anecdotal evidence that Zinn’s work is popular among some high-school teachers, there is zero hard evidence to support Santorum’s core statistical claim -- that Zinn’s volume is taught in more high-school history classes than any other book. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",false,"National, Education, History, Rick Santorum, "
1198,1981,"30 years on, AIDS fight may tilt more to treatment.","June 3, 2011","After 30 years of AIDS prevention efforts, global leaders may now need to shift their focus to spending more on drugs used to treat the disease as new data show this is also the best way to prevent the virus from spreading.","Julie Steenhuysen, Barbara Lewis","People light candles for AIDS victims during an AIDS awareness event marking the World AIDS Day at Sergels Torg square in Stockholm December 1, 2010. REUTERS/Janerik Henriksson/Scanpix The U.N. General Assembly will take up the issue next week as it assesses progress in fighting the disease — first reported on June 5, 1981 — that has infected more than 60 million people and claimed nearly 30 million lives. Guiding the meeting is groundbreaking new data that shows early treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, can cut its transmission to a sexual partner by 96 percent. “There had been for a long time this artificial dichotomy or artificial tension between treatment versus prevention. Now it is very clear that treatment is prevention and treatment is an important part of a multifaceted combination strategy,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), told Reuters. Fauci, who has made AIDS research his life’s work, has a big role to play in the discussion of the NIH-funded study made public on May 12. “A month ago, we didn’t have that data. People were still arguing. ‘Well, we are not so sure if you treat people you are really going to prevent infection,’” Fauci said. “The policy makers need to sit down and say, ‘Now that we know this, is this going to be enough incentive to change around our policy?’”   That could mean redirecting, or adding to, global spending on fighting AIDS, particularly how much is spent on education or other research versus antiretroviral drugs that allow patients to live with the suppressed disease for many years. In 2010, nearly $16 billion was spent on HIV response in low and middle-income countries, according to the U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS. UNAIDS says at least $22 billion will be needed to combat the disease by 2015, helping avert 12 million new infections and 7.4 million more deaths in the next decade. Globally, the number of people living with HIV rose to 34 million by the end of 2010, from 33.3 million a year earlier. But in poorer countries, a majority of eligible patients were not receiving antiretroviral treatment, according to UNAIDS. Fauci says he has already discussed this with policymakers and may make public his views on needed policy changes at the International AIDS Society meeting in Rome. “I don’t think it’s going to be one-size-fits all,” Fauci said of the policy approach. “There is going to be certainly a difference between how things are looked at in the developing world and the developed world. And within the developed world, I think it will be a country-by-country issue.”   UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibe noted that AIDS remained “a metaphor for inequality” as the vast majority of patients live in Africa, where every year nearly 400,000 babies are born with HIV. “If you’re privileged to be born in the North, you will not die from HIV. It you’re privileged to be born in the North, you will not have a baby born with HIV,” Sidibe said. “Countries need to start looking at innovative financing. We need to have drugs which are not just for the rich market.”",true,Health News
1200,33802,Those who go swimming less than one hour after eating will be taken by a cramp and drown.,"August 14, 2001","Sightings:   Reference to this belief appears in the 1968 film Star! when one of the characters remarks that “It hasn’t been an hour since lunch” as she passes on a swimming invitation. We mention this sighting in particular solely because of its age: it shows the belief was widespread even in 1968. Also, in a episode of television sitcom Cybill (“Cybill Sheridan’s Day Off,” original air date 18 March 1998), the lead character commands a hunky pool boy whom she loves to see strip down and dive into the pool, “You know, it’s been over an hour since I ate. You can swim again.”",Snopes Staff,"One of the greatest bogeymen needlessly inflicted upon countless youngsters is the unshakable belief that if they go swimming too soon after eating, they will be seized by cramps and drown. Unless that hour is waited out — all sixty minutes of it, and no cheating — they will surely sink like stones, leaving barely a ripple on the surface. Example:  I was a kid in the 1960s, and I used to hear the “Don’t go swimming for an hour after you eat or you’ll get cramps” exhortation from my mother. I had no idea what these “cramps” were, but they sounded bad. Being literal-minded even as a kid, I was puzzled by the whole idea. I understood “cramps” to be something that would afflict a person who entered the water too soon after eating (rather than who swam too soon after eating); that somehow this bad thing happened if water came in contact with your skin within an hour of your last meal. This raised all sorts of questions in my young mind — How did the “cramps” know you were in a swimming pool? (You could get wet from a hose, for example, but nobody’s parent ever warned us about running through sprinklers after eating.) How did the “cramps” know when the hour was up? (What would happen if you waded into the pool only fifty minutes after eating lunch, for example?) Did the “cramps” know the difference between someone who had eaten a full meal and someone who had merely snacked on a Slurpee? The whole thing was very mysterious. No other outcome was possible, according to this caution. The warning made no allowance for those who would develop cramps but would manage to unkink themselves in time or who would make it to safety in a still-cramped state, let alone for those who wouldn’t develop cramps in the first place. If you dared go into the water less than an hour after eating, you would — with 100% certainty — get cramps, and you would then — also with 100% certainty — drown. Kids who had eaten so little as a sandwich and a popsicle were routinely forced to sit out the full hour by the water’s side, forlornly watching their friends splash about. No doting mother would have sentenced her young’un to the certain death that awaited those fool enough to ignore this time-tested truism, and some went so far as to forbid wading. One hour was the rule, so one hour it was. And never mind that an hour to a kid is approximately as long as four are to an adult. Caution is a good thing when it comes to youngsters and water, because drowning is a leading cause of accidental death for infants and children nationwide. Yet in this case, the caution was far from warranted. No one knows how long the belief about the dangers of swimming after eating has been with us, but it does appear in Scouting for Boys, which was published in 1908:  First, there is the danger of cramp. If you bathe within an hour and a half after taking a meal, that is, before your food is digested, you are very likely to get cramp. Cramp doubles you up in extreme pain so that you cannot move your arms or legs — and down you go. You may drown — and it will be your own fault. In 1961 exercise physiologist Arthur Steinhaus took a position against this belief in the Journal of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation. He labeled the very idea of stomach cramps “questionable.”  Although muscle cramps in the calves, feet, and hands while swimming are not unknown, they are certainly not life threatening provided the swimmer does not panic. The sharpest charley horse can be tamed by tensing and relaxing the afflicted muscle, a treatment any swimmer can manage to perform. Even if the cramp is left untreated, it will not cause the swimmer to slip beneath the waves. One can simply float until help arrives. All of the above applies to ordinary muscle cramps of the sort brought on by overexertion, not the dread stomach cramps this admonition warns against. Many believe this fearsome condition does not exist, although those who tout the dangers of premature swimming will go into great detail when describing the presumed mechanics behind the threat:  [Engel & Malloy, 1993] A form of muscle cramp, stitches are caused by the blood supply to the diaphragm being shut off by pressure from the lungs above and the abdomen below, like a bomb and a submarine attack at the same time. So what does this have to do with food? Well, if you have food in your stomach you are likely to develop stomach cramps. Here’s why: To aid digestion the heart pumps a large volume of blood to the stomach. During exercise, the heart pumps blood to the muscles, and the flow of the blood to the stomach is greatly diminished. Without the blood supply, the stomach muscles suffer from lack of oxygen and, like any muscle without oxygen, develop cramps. Whether oxygen-deprivation stomach cramps are real or not is open to debate, as is whether they can be brought on by eating right before engaging in strenuous activity. What’s not in doubt, however, are the lack of deaths associated with swimming right after eating — there hasn’t been so much as one drowning attributed to this, not even a near drowning. For something that was supposed to be fatal if you so much as dipped a toe, this particular old wives’ tale proved to be a dud. So what to do with this information? Those who are very careful about not taking any risks that are avoidable might want to put off striking out for the other side of the lake right after having tucked into a large meal. However, ordinary levels of swimming or just general horsing around in the water need not be eschewed, even if a whole turkey has just been consumed, feathers and all. Likewise, strenuous sidestroking can still be safely undertaken after a snack or a light to moderate-sized meal. As for those kids who will continue to be sidelined for an hour after eating (deeply internalized cautions are very hard to dislodge, especially those inculcated into the legions of moms and dads already convinced everything their youngsters get up to will end in disaster), they can at least take comfort in the knowledge that they’re not being raised in Cuba where the parental belief runs to three hours.",false,Old Wives' Tales
1201,1629,Paralyzed California man recounts re-learning to walk via computer.,"September 24, 2015","For paraplegic Adam Fritz, the thrill of the computer-assisted first steps he took five years after being paralyzed in a motorcycle crash came only after he was unhooked from the system that enabled him to walk briefly in a bioengineering lab.",Steve Gorman,"During the experiment itself, Fritz recounted, he had to keep his mind focused entirely on placing one foot in front of the other as his brain waves were translated by a computer algorithm into impulses that bypassed his severed spinal cord and activated his legs. “If you break your concentration, it wouldn’t work anymore,” he told Reuters shortly after scientists from the University of California, Irvine, reported the feat in the British open-access Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation. “Once I finished, I had that ‘Oh my God, this thing worked,’ kind of a moment,” the 28-year-old religious studies graduate said. “It was very exhilarating.”  The “proof-of-concept” study published late Wednesday documented how brain-to-computer technology, which converts thoughts to body motion, enabled Fritz to become the first person paralyzed from the waist down by spinal cord injury to walk without the use of robotics. As captured in a YouTube video of that pioneering moment last October, it was hardly a casual stroll. (www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBAeR-Z0EHg)  Fritz is seen slowly shuffling with painstaking effort across the floor of UC Irvine’s iMove Lab. His weight was partially supported by an overhead suspension harness and a walker he grasped to keep his body upright. But researchers said he propelled himself entirely by his own leg muscles, controlled by his own brain, over a distance of 12 feet (3.66 meters). The weight support was necessary because he lacks sensation in his legs or feet, said Dr. An Do, a neurologist and study co-author. The outcome marked a promising though incremental achievement in the development of brain-computer interfaces that may in the future help stroke and spinal injury patients regain day-to-day mobility, but clinical applications remain years away, Do said. Fritz, who now works full time as a disability claims administrator, recounted that his computer-assisted walk posed a rather unexpected challenge. “The hardest part, honestly, wasn’t taking the steps - it was stopping, because at that point, you’re focusing so hard on getting yourself to walk that to instantly stop, that was actually difficult to do,” he said. Fritz said it took nearly a year of rigorous physical and mental training to prepare for the experiment, using a specially designed virtual-reality simulator where he learned to control a video-animated character using his own brain waves. “I spent months sitting in front of a computer just trying to make that little avatar move, and there were times I felt like, ‘What’s the point? I’m never going to get it.’”  But he eventually caught on. Once ready to take computer-assisted steps of his own, he did so initially suspended a few inches off the ground and ultimately with his feet on the floor. Neural signals produced as he concentrated on moving his legs were detected by an electroencephalogram (EEG) worn over his head, processed through a computer algorithm and relayed to electrodes placed around his knees to stimulate his muscles. Fritz said he already has volunteered to take part in later research stages in which scientists hope to miniaturize the system with brain implants allowing greater control and perhaps even to deliver the sensation of foot pressure back to the brain for balance and weight support. “Seeing this experiment and what this research has done, I think within my lifetime we will see a cure for spinal cord injury, or a treatment to fix it,” Fritz said.",true,Health News
1203,35289,"Under U.S. President Donald Trump, federal authorities are confiscating orders of personal protective equipment (PPE) from local governments amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","April 24, 2020","What's true: Numerous health care officials and state leaders have reported instances in which federal authorities have intervened on local agencies' agreements with PPE vendors. In several cases, state officials reported the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) confiscated supplies within the last minute of deals with no explanation, while others reported the agency outbid them for the equipment. What's false: However, FEMA does not appear to have an organized effort for commandeering equipment at the local level. Agency representatives said they are working under a broad distribution plan to get supplies to areas in highest need.",Jessica Lee,"As the U.S. federal government and states clashed over how to respond to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020, workers on the frontlines of helping virus patients reported widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 masks and gowns. Hospital and state leaders described a chaotic and highly competitive market for securing supplies from vendors — disarray that critics of President Donald Trump blamed on his ad-hoc approach to addressing the shortfall. Meanwhile, several news reports surfaced, claiming federal officials seized PPE shipments from local agencies or stopped the deals between vendors and states by offering higher bids. Snopes received numerous inquiries from readers about the validity of the assertion. To get to the root of the claim, we first researched from where the news reports originated. From The New York Times to the Boston Globe to The Intelligencer (a blog within New York magazine), several media outlets highlighted the experience of Dr. Andrew W. Artenstein, an infectious disease physician in Springfield, Massachusetts, who said the pandemic has forced him into PPE supply-chain work. On April 17, 2020, he published a letter in a peer-reviewed medical journal, The New England Journal of Medicine, about his apparent travails of getting a large shipment of face masks and respirators from a warehouse in a mid-Atlantic state. (He told The New York Times he would not publicize the location of the transaction out of fear of jeopardizing his relationship with the supply vendor.) The letter read: Before we could send the funds by wire transfer, two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrived, showed their badges, and started questioning me. No, this shipment was not headed for resale or the black market. The agents checked my credentials, and I tried to convince them that the shipment of PPE was bound for hospitals. After receiving my assurances and hearing about our health system’s urgent needs, the agents let the boxes of equipment be released and loaded into the trucks. But I was soon shocked to learn that the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting our PPE. Only some quick calls leading to intervention by our congressional representative prevented its seizure. It is unclear why federal officials may have targeted the Massachusetts delivery or where they would have allegedly redirected the supplies. Citing a policy of not confirming or denying specific investigations, the FBI declined to comment on Artenstein’s account in an April 20 New York Times story, saying only that the agency had been working to ensure that PPE “is not being unlawfully distributed or hoarded” during the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, the Boston Globe could not reach the Department of Homeland Security, which encompasses FEMA, to comment on the doctor’s story. Though widely circulated online, Artenstein’s story was not the only report of federal interference in the procurement of PPE in spring 2020. On April 7, the Los Angeles Times reported health care officials in seven states said the federal government seized their shipments and did not give guidance on how or if the local agencies would someday get the supplies they ordered. “Are they stockpiling this stuff? Are they distributing it? We don’t know,” one unidentified official told the LA Times. “And are we going to ever get any of it back if we need supplies? It would be nice to know these things.” Additionally, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told The New York Times that FEMA stepped in at the last minute of a deal the city had with “one of its usual suppliers” to buy 1 million masks; a New Jersey county official told local media an order of 35,000 N95 and other masks were “commandeered” by the federal government; and a leader of the private health care company Kaiser Permanente told staff members that the company had found 20 million masks to purchase, “but the feds actually seized that shipment before we were able to acquire it,” the Times reported. The same news story said: In Massachusetts, state leaders said they had confirmed a vast order of personal protective equipment for their health workers; then the Trump administration took control of the shipments. In Kentucky, the head of a hospital system told members of Congress that his broker had pulled out of an agreement to deliver four shipments of desperately needed medical gear after the supplies were commandeered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado thought his state had secured 500 ventilators before they were “swept up by FEMA.” Adding to those reports are worries by Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker that if he publicly discusses how he’s obtaining masks and gloves for his state, federal officials may catch wind and seize the materials, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. “The supply chain has been likened to the wild West, and once you have purchased supplies, ensuring they get to the state is another herculean feat,” a spokesperson for the governor told the news outlet.",true,"Politics, COVID-19"
1206,27854,The Newfoundland town of Gander played host to thousands of airline passengers stranded there when American airspace was closed after the September 11 terrorist attacks.,"November 19, 2001",The Newfoundland town of Gander played host to thousands of airline passengers stranded there after 9/11.,David Mikkelson,"Gander, a town of about 10,000 people (and 550 hotel rooms) in Newfoundland, Canada, lies in the northeastern tip of North America and has long served as a refueling stop for trans-Atlantic flights and a temporary haven for flights diverted from their destinations. Shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001, the town become famous through a widely shared message extolling the hospitality of the town’s residents in helping stranded travelers: My Mom, who, as most of you know, works for Air Canada, got this from a pal. It is written by a member of a Delta Flight crew called Nazim:         We were about 5 hours out of Frankfurt flying over the North Atlantic and I was in my crew rest seat taking my scheduled rest break. All of a sudden the curtains parted violently and I was told to go to the cockpit, right now, to see the captain. As soon as I got there I noticed  the crew had one of those “All Business” looks on their faces. The captain handed me a printed message. I quickly read the message and realized the importance of it. The message was from Atlanta, addressed to our flight, and simply said, “All airways over the Continental US are closed. Land ASAP at the nearest airport, advise your destination.” Now, when a dispatcher tells you to land immediately without suggesting which airport, one can assume that the dispatcher has reluctantly given up control of the flight to the captain. We knew it was a serious situation and we needed to find terra firma quickly. It was quickly decided that the nearest airport was 400 miles away, behind our right shoulder, in Gander, on the island of New Foundland. A quick request was made to the Canadian traffic controller and a right turn, directly to Gander, was approved immediately. We found out later why there was no hesitation by the Canadian controller approving our request. We, the in-flight crew, were told to get the airplane ready for an immediate landing. While this was going on another message arrived from Atlanta telling us about some terrorist activity in the New York area. We briefed the in-flight crew about going to Gander and we went about our business ‘closing down’ the airplane for a landing. A few minutes later I went back to the cockpit to find out that some airplanes had been hijacked and were being flown into buildings all over the US. We decided to make an announcement and LIE to the passengers for the time being. We told them that an instrument problem had arisen on the airplane and that we needed to land at Gander, to have it checked. We promised to give more information after landing in Gander. There were many unhappy passengers but that is par for the course. We landed in Gander about 40 minutes after the start of this episode. There were already about 20 other airplanes on the ground from all over the world. After we parked on the ramp the captain made the following announcement. “Ladies and gentlemen, you must be wondering if all these airplanes around us have the same instrument problem as we have. But the reality is that we are here for a good reason.”  Then he went on to explain the little bit we knew about the situation in the US. There were loud gasps and stares of disbelief. Local time at Gander was 12:30 pm. (11:00 AM EST)     Gander control told us to stay put. No one was allowed to get off the aircraft. No one on the ground was allowed to come near the aircrafts. Only a car from the airport police would come around once in a while, look us over and go on to the next airplane. In the next hour or so all the airways over the North Atlantic were vacated and Gander alone ended up with 53 airplanes from all over the world, out of which 27 were flying US flags. We were told that each and every plane was to be offloaded, one at a time, with the foreign carriers given the priority. We were No. 14 in the US category. We were further told that we would be given a tentative time to deplane at 6 pm. Meanwhile bits of news started to come in over the aircraft radio and for the first time we learned that airplanes were flown into the World Trade Center in New York and into the Pentagon in DC. People were trying to use their cell phones but were unable to connect due to a different cell system in Canada. Some did get through but were only able to get to the Canadian operator who would tell them that the lines to the US were either blocked or jammed and to try again. Some time late in the evening the news filtered to us that the World Trade Center buildings had collapsed and that a fourth hijacking had resulted in a crash. Now the passengers were totally bewildered and emotionally exhausted but stayed calm as we kept reminding them to look around to see that we were not the only ones in this predicament. There were 52 other planes with people on them in the same situation. We also told them that the Canadian Government was in charge and we were at their mercy. True to their word, at 6 PM, Gander airport told us that our turn to deplane would come at 11 AM, the next morning. That took the last wind out of the passengers and they simply resigned and accepted this news without much noise and really started to get into a mode of spending the night on the airplane. Gander had promised us any and all medical attention if needed; medicine, water, and lavatory servicing. And they were true to their word. Fortunately we had no medical situation during the night. We did have a young lady who was 33 weeks into her pregnancy. We took REALLY good care of her. The night passed without any further complications on our airplane despite the uncomfortable sleeping arrangements. About 10:30 on the morning of the 12th we were told to get ready to leave the aircraft. A convoy of school buses showed up at the side of the airplane, the stairway was hooked up and the passengers were taken to the terminal for “processing” We, the crew, were taken to the same terminal but were told to go to a different section, where we were processed through Immigration and customs and then had to register with the Red Cross. After that we were isolated from our passengers and were taken in a caravan of vans to a very small hotel in the town of Gander. We had no idea where our passengers were going. The town of Gander has a population of 10,400 people. Red Cross told us that they were going to process about 10,500 passengers from all the airplanes that were forced into Gander. We were told to just relax at the hotel and wait for a call to go back to the airport, but not to expect that call for a while. We found out the total scope of the terror back home only after getting to our hotel and turning on the TV, 24 hours after it all started. Meanwhile we enjoyed ourselves going around town discovering things and enjoying the hospitality. The people were so friendly and they just knew that we were the “Plane people”. We all had a great time until we got that call, 2 days later, on the 14th at 7 AM. We made it to the airport by 8:30 AM and left for Atlanta at 12:30 PM arriving in Atlanta at about 4:30 PM. (Gander is 1 hour and 30 minutes ahead of EST, yes!, 1 hour and 30 minutes.) But that’s not what I wanted to tell you. What passengers told us was so uplifting and incredible and the timing couldn’t have been better. We found out that Gander and the surrounding small communities, within a 75 Kilometer radius, had closed all the high schools, meeting halls, lodges, and any other large gathering places. They converted all these facilities to a mass lodging area. Some had cots set up, some had mats with sleeping bags and pillows set up. ALL the high school students HAD to volunteer taking care of the “GUESTS”. Our 218 passengers ended up in a town called Lewisporte, about 45 Kilometers from Gander. There they were put in a high school. If any women wanted to be in a women only facility, that was arranged. Families were kept together. All the elderly passengers were given no choice and were taken to private homes. Remember that young pregnant lady, she was put up in a private home right across the street from a 24 hour Urgent Care type facility. There were DDS on call and they had both male and female nurses available and stayed with the crowd for the duration. Phone calls and emails to US and Europe were available for every one once a day. During the days the passengers were given a choice of “Excursion” trips. Some people went on boat cruises of the lakes and harbors. Some went to see the local forests. Local bakeries stayed open to make fresh bread for the guests. Food was prepared by all the residents and brought to the school for those who elected to stay put. Others were driven to the eatery of their choice and fed. They were given tokens to go to the local Laundromat to wash their clothes, since their luggage was still on the aircraft. In other words every single need was met for those unfortunate travelers. Passengers were crying while telling us these stories. After all that, they were delivered to the airport right on time and without a single one missing or late. All because the local Red Cross had all the information about the goings on back at Gander and knew which group needed to leave for the airport at what time. Absolutely incredible. When passengers came on board, it was like they had been on a cruise. Everybody knew everybody else by their name. They were swapping stories of their stay, impressing each other with who had the better time. It was mind boggling. Our flight back to Atlanta looked like a party flight. We simply stayed out of their way. The passengers had totally bonded and they were calling each other by their first names, exchanging phone numbers, addresses, and email addresses. And then a strange thing happened. One of our business class passengers approached me and asked if he could speak over the PA to his fellow passengers. We never, never, allow that. But something told me to get out of his way. I said “of course”. The gentleman picked up the PA and reminded everyone about what they had just gone through in the last few days. He reminded them of the hospitality they had received at the hands of total strangers. He further stated that he would like to do something in return for the good folks of the town of Lewisporte. He said he was going to set up a Trust Fund under the name of DELTA 15 (our flight number). The purpose of the trust fund is to provide a scholarship for high school student(s) of Lewisporte to help them go to college. He asked for donations of any amount from his fellow travelers. When the paper with donations got back to us with the amounts, names, phone numbers and addresses, it totaled to $14.5K or about $20K Canadian. The gentleman who started all this turned out to be an MD from Virginia. He promised to match the donations and to start the administrative work on the scholarship. He also said that he would forward this proposal to Delta Corporate and ask them to donate as well. Why, all of this? Just because some people in far away places were kind to some strangers, who happened to literally drop in among them? WHY NOT? On 11 September  2001, a total of 240 flights were rerouted to Canada when American airspace was closed after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, and 39 of those flights ended up in Gander. The townspeople of Gander (and surrounding areas) came through magnificently in the crisis, as 6,579 marooned passengers and crew members swelled their population by two-thirds:  Responding to radio announcements, the residents and businesses of Gander and other towns supplied toothbrushes, deodorant, soap, blankets and even spare underwear, along with offers of hot showers and guest rooms. Newtel Communications, the telephone company, set up phone banks for passengers to call home. Local television cable companies wired schools and church halls, where passengers watched events unfolding in New York and realized how lucky they were. There were some with special needs. Carl and Ethna Smith found kosher food through an airport caterer and a new set of kitchenware for an orthodox Jewish family from New York. At the Gander Baptist Church, Gary and Donna House dealt with the needs of four Moldovan refugee families, members of a religious sect who spoke no English and were bewildered by events. Plenty of grateful Americans who passed through Gander that day took the opportunity to pen appreciative letters similar to the one quoted above when they returned home, such as the following letter to the editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette:   We’re writing to express our appreciation for the people in Canada who so generously assisted the people on US Airways Flight 3 returning to the United States on Sept. 11. We were grounded in Gander, Newfoundland, at 1:30 p.m. on that day and then informed of the events that had taken place in New York, at the Pentagon and “outside of Pittsburgh.”  We spent the next 23 hours locked on the plane until we could be safely cleared to leave the plane, and then we were transported to the Salvation Army in Lewisporte, 45 minutes away. The people of Lewisporte and the Salvation Army fed us three meals a day and provided countless blankets, toothbrushes and toiletries for the passengers on that flight. The elementary school next to the Salvation Army building canceled classes for its children to provide us with access to the much-needed shower stall and the computer classroom for us to e-mail home. During that time when all of us were frantic to find out what had happened, make sure our loved ones were safe and contact those who would be missing us in the next few days, our hosts were endlessly cheerful, giving and kind. They dropped everything to cook for us and make us feel less isolated and abandoned during those five days of uncertainty. When we finally received word of the plane’s clearance for leaving, we said goodbye with bittersweet memories of a group of people of unlimited generosity. This experience will stay with us during this time and continue to remind us that we have more friends than enemies in this world, and we are grateful for the proximity to our country of some of them. And this letter from the Cleveland Plain Dealer:  We were flying home from a wonderful vacation in Paris and were about an hour from Newark when an announcement was made that terrorists had attacked New York and Washington and our flight was being diverted to Gander, Newfoundland. We were the fourth of 37 planes to land in Gander and were kept on the plane for seven hours. Then we proceeded to immigration, where many compassionate people met us. An unidentified woman approached and put her arm around us and wanted to know if there was anything she could do to help us. At this point we were greatly concerned about our two sons who work in Manhattan. She took us to a phone, where we called our oldest son, who assured us that he and his brother were safe. From there we were put on school buses and taken to the College of the North Atlantic. Many ordinary, caring people met us and made all 300 passengers feel welcome. We were given blankets and pillows from their homes. We stayed for two nights and three days. We slept on the floor, as cots could not be rounded up fast enough. We shared our classroom with 18 others and a dog. Everyone was extraordinarily thoughtful of each other. One woman must have put her life on hold and was constantly checking on us. She even came to the airport when we finally left to make sure we all were fine. I never saw her without a smile. The lady who ran the cafeteria along with many neighbors made hot meals and brought in casseroles each day. Students helped us to use e-mail, and we were able to use the phone to call our family. No organization with financial backing was behind this – this was a call to neighbors and friends to come and help those of us in need. We will never be able to think of Gander, Newfoundland, without remembering all the goodness and kindness that was showered upon us by our neighbors and friends from Canada. And yes, a Gander Flight 15 college scholarship fund was established for high school students in Lewisporte, Newfoundland, by passengers, crew members and friends of Delta Flight 15. Other towns in Newfoundland and Labrador (and across Canada) also took in temporarily displaced passengers with hospitality that day and are equally deserving of our gratitude. A variant of this item circulated in 2012 identified Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney as the Delta Flight 15 passenger who established a scholarship trust fund for Lewisporte high school students. Romney was not a passenger on that flight, nor did he establish a scholarship trust fund for Lewisporte students.",true,"September 11th, 9/11"
1207,2360,"Jaws, the prequel: Scientists find the 'Model T Ford' of sharks.","April 16, 2014","You’ve heard of the Model T Ford, the famed early 20th-century automobile that was the forerunner of the modern car. But how about the Model T shark?",Will Dunham,"Scientists on Wednesday announced the discovery of the impeccably preserved fossilized remains of a shark that lived 325 million years ago in what is now Arkansas, complete with a series of cartilage arches that supported its gills and jaws. Because shark skeletons are made of soft cartilage, not hard bone, finding anything more than scrappy fossilized remains of teeth and vertebrae is rare. Finding a fossil shark in an almost three-dimensional state of preservation, boasting important skeletal structures, is exceptional. This primitive shark, named Ozarcus mapesae, may lead scientists to rethink shark evolution, erasing the notion that these beasts of the deep have remained little changed since they first appeared at least 420 million years ago. “These things have been very successful, among the top predators in the Earth’s oceans, for over 400 million years,” said paleontologist John Maisey of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, one of the researchers. “The best analogy I can come up with is this: It’s like comparing a Model T Ford with a modern automobile. They are both recognizably the same kind of thing. But they are completely different under the hood. We found the Model T of sharks,” added Maisey, whose research was published in the journal Nature. Those cartilage arches, for example, are quite different from those in modern sharks, the scientists said. This suggests that while their general outward appearance has stayed roughly the same, important changes have occurred over time that have helped make sharks the perfect eating machines of the sea. Maisey said Ozarcus mapesae was small by shark standards - about 2 to 3 feet long, with relatively big eyes. It swam in the murky waters of a shallow inland sea teeming with life including other fish and squid-like creatures in shells. It is not the oldest shark fossil, but it is the oldest to reveal all of the anatomy of the skeleton supporting the gill arches, a vitally important element of a fish. Employing sophisticated equipment at the European Synchrotron in France, the scientists used high-resolution X-rays to obtain a detailed view of the shape and organization of the arches and associated structures. They found that the arrangement was unlike that of modern sharks but was very much like that of bony fishes like today’s tuna or swordfish. Maisey said that scientists had viewed today’s sharks as very primitive creatures while seeing bony fish as more advanced. “Modern sharks cannot be considered anymore as living fossils that did not evolve since their origin. They are actually very derived compared to early cartilaginous fishes,” said American Museum of Natural History paleontologist Alan Pradel, another of the researchers. Sharks have undergone many other changes since the time of Ozarcus mapesae, the researchers said. Their jaws are no longer firmly bound to the cranium, giving them greater biting freedom. Specializations in their inner ear enable them to hear very low frequency sounds, improving their hunting ability. They are better at replacing teeth. And there have been changes in their scales, among other things. “There’s lots of ways in which modern sharks are quite highly evolved and different from the Model T,” Maisey said. The shark’s genus name, Ozarcus, comes from the Ozark Mountain region where it was found. Its species name, mapesae, honors Ohio University scientist Gene Mapes, who found it.",true,Science News
1214,36215,"A social media post correctly contextualizes the 30,000 approximate gun deaths each year in the United States.","September 4, 2019","‘There are 30,000 Gun Related Deaths Per Year by Firearms’",  Kim LaCapria  ,"In August 2019, a Facebook post about the United States’ purported 30,000 gun deaths per year circulated, typically copied and pasted into individual posts which themselves were each shared a handful of times.One particular version coupled with a “mass shooters 2019” meme (a meme that is riddled with flaws, and which we debunked in early August 2019) was shared by one user in mid-August 2019. A version was also published to the blog of the agenda-driven Heartland Institute on August 26 2019, purportedly “written by Nancy Thorner.”Thorner clearly did not write the copypasta commentary for which she took credit, as a near-verbatim version was shared by Ted Nugent via Facebook in June 2017. In October 2017, the same text was shared to Reddit’s r/DebunkThis:Debunk This: Gun Control Doesn’t Matter Because It’s Not A Leading Killer of Americans from DebunkThisThat post’s title (“Debunk This: Gun Control Doesn’t Matter Because It’s Not A Leading Killer of Americans”) alluded to the general gist of the forwarded message — that through a series of calculations and statistics, the clear takeaway should be that guns do not warrant classification as the danger the media made them out to be. A search of Twitter revealed the text of the post was regularly shared as seemingly original content by individuals dating back to at least June 2017.Right off the bat, the post could be characterized as a “gish gallop.” Named for creationist Duane Gish and also described as “proof by verbosity,” RationalWiki defines a “gish gallop” as follows:“The Gish Gallop is the fallacious debate tactic of drowning your opponent in a flood of individually-weak arguments in order to prevent rebuttal of the whole argument collection without great effort. The Gish Gallop is a conveyor belt-fed version of the on the spot fallacy, as it’s unreasonable for anyone to have a well-composed answer immediately available to every argument present in the Gallop. The Gish Gallop is named after creationist Duane Gish, who often abused it … Gish Galloping is frequently employed (with particularly devastating results) in timed debates. The same is true for any time- or character-limited debate medium, including Twitter and newspaper editorials.“Examples of Gish Gallops are commonly found online, in crank “list” articles that claim to show “X hundred reasons for (or against) Y”. At the highest levels of verbosity, with dozens upon dozens or even hundreds of minor arguments interlocking, each individual “reason” is — upon closer inspection — likely to consist of a few sentences at best.”With that in mind, the “30,000 gun deaths in America” forward is certainly a mixture of statistics, assertions, and opinions, the latter of which often cannot be fact-checked. Its various claims were voluminous as befits a gish gallop, and many were cobbled together from long-circulating claims of many types. The Ted Nugent iteration began:There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. U.S. population 324,059,091 as of Wednesday, June 22, 2016. Do the math: 0.000000925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:Even “this is not disputed” is an iffy start, because no evidence of whether the number cited is or is not disputed was included. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight averaged gun deaths across several years, estimating 33,000 approximate deaths by firearm each year in the United States — making the number reasonably accurate, but not exact. Other figures referenced in the forward appeared to come from the FiveThirtyEight piece on gun deaths linked above, presumably accurate as of 2016.In the next sentence, the forward urges readers to “do the math,” citing a population of 324,059,091 as of June 2016. (The United States population had climbed by four million in 2019, so we’ll use 2016 statistics wherever possible.) The post asserts that the 33,000 gun deaths — misstated as 30,000 — amounted to 0.000000925 percent of all Americans in any given year.Using the accurate figure of 33,000 gun deaths and the population provided of 324,059,091, the actual “math” works out to 0.01 percent — not “0.000000925 percent.” That section subsequently holds that the purportedly small number of gun deaths is “insignificant,” which is purely subjective opinion.A final note on that section is that readers might be duped into believing that the mortality rate from guns is less than one percent. However, mortality rate is not calculated by contrasting a cause of death with the entire population. It is actually “a measure of the number of deaths (in general, or due to a specific cause) in a particular population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit of time,” and “expressed in units of deaths per 1,000 individuals per year.”We are typically accustomed to understanding mortality percentages in the context of mortality rate. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Wonder data, the actual mortality rate for any firearm-related deaths from 1999 through 2017 is 10.6 per 100,000 Americans. Consequently, the percentage as presented could constitute the logical fallacy of a “biased sample.”Moving on:• 65% of those deaths are by suicide which would never be prevented by gun laws • 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified • 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons —gun violence • 3% are accidental discharge deathsSo technically, “gun violence” is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100.Next up the post claims that 65 percent of gun deaths are suicide, and “would never be prevented by gun laws.” No attempt is made to substantiate the claim. A 2017 study (“Handgun waiting periods reduce gun deaths“) published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences observed that waiting periods alone can reduce gun-related suicides by up to 11 percent — and waiting periods are just one gun control measure.An undated Johns Hopkins/Bloomberg American Health Initiative paper notes several ways in which gun control measures are known to affect rates of suicide:“Restricting access to lethal means, at least temporarily, during a time of crisis can prevent suicide. Even if one wishing to attempt suicide were to substitute a different method, he or she is far more likely to survive that attempt because firearms are the most lethal means available. And the vast majority of individuals who survive a suicide attempt do not go on to die from suicide in the future.”According to research on the availability of firearms and suicide, gun control measures do in fact lower rates of suicide, making that claim flatly false.The post also claims that another 15 percent of gun deaths are officer-involved shootings and thus “justified,” once again an opinion clearly not espoused by all — and certainly not a fact. It goes on to state that a further 17 percent are under the umbrella of “gun violence,” and three percent are accidental discharge-related deaths, or firearm accidents.From there, the original author, whomever that actually was, eliminates the purported 15 percent of officer-involved deaths, and three percent of accidental deaths (along with suicide) are automatically excluded from the number or rate of gun deaths, going on to redefine “gun deaths” as “deaths solely from gun violence.”Tracking the math in the upcoming section is simple, as the rate of “gun violence” is provided as 17 percent of all gun deaths, and the original erroneous figure of all gun deaths was provided as 30,000. Seventeen percent of 30,000 is 5,100 (approximately), and 17 percent of 33,000 is 5,610. But as gish gallops are prone to doing, the missive at that point unilaterally decides that the only gun deaths that truly count are what the writer defines as “gun violence,” and all other gun-related deaths do not “count” towards meaningful statistics.It appears many of the numbers are at least crudely based on the FiveThirtyEight post, and according to that item, approximately 12,000 of the 33,000 deaths cited annually are “homicides,” which would fall under the same umbrella as gun violence by all but the most creative accounting. We could not determine how the author identified that number as 17 percent, but homicides alone using those two numbers represented 36 percent of gun deaths in FiveThirtyEight’s data.From that point, the post goes into supposed city hotbeds for gun violence, claiming that a quarter of all gun crime occurs in just four cities:Still too many? Well, first, how are those deaths spanned across the nation? • 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago • 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore • 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit • 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)So basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.This basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.Again, while the numbers look authoritative, no citations or frames of reference are included in the post or its iterations on blogs and Facebook, so hunting down possible sources for the claims is a needle-in-a-haystack proposition. But the base claim — that four cities (Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and Washington D.C.) have massive rates of gun crime and essentially skew the country’s curve — is both old and long debunked. We examined the claim in 2015 and rated it mostly false, as did PolitiFact in 2018.Even if those claims were accurate (they were not), they would constitute cherry picking, another fallacy. Typically, the origin meme holds that excluding those four cities from overall gun homicide rates drastically alters that rate, a claim repeatedly proven false:“The cities cited in the [four cities] meme accounted for 1,568 of 17,250, or 9.1 percent, of all homicides reported to the FBI in 2016, Tom Kovandzic, a criminologist at the University of Texas, Dallas, calculated for us. And without those cities, the homicide rate (per capita) would only decline by 7.73 percent, or from 5.34 to 4.93.”Its subsequent claim that the exclusion of those four cities “leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state” is based on prior false conclusions, and thus irrelevant to the overall credibility of the post as a whole. The post then states — correctly — that California has the strictest gun laws, before launching into a lengthy, barely intelligible rant about other causes of death, former United States President Barack Obama, and cheeseburgers.Incidentally, states with stricter gun laws maintain higher rates of gun-related homicide when they share borders with states that have looser restrictions. Another aside is that in 2017, the most recent year for which gun statistics were available, 39,773 Americans died from gun-related injuries in the United States. Basing any of these calculations on that number versus the original inaccurate 30,000 figure would greatly alter the percentages involved in breakdowns.No portion of the following segment of the circulating post constitutes a piece of checkable data, nor does it seem to make sense as an editorial opinion:Now, who has the strictest gun laws by far? California, of course, but understand, so it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. So if all cities and states are not created equally, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.Are 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault all is done by criminals and thinking that criminals will obey laws is ludicrous. That’s why they are criminals.But what about other deaths each year? • 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT! • 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths • 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide)Now it gets good: • 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! So what is the point? If Obama and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides……Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions!So you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? It’s pretty simple. : Taking away guns gives control to governments.The founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the British did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. It is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.Thus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the U.S. Constitution. It must be preserved at all costs.So the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster: “Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword, because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force at the command of Congress can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power.”Remember, when it comes to “gun control,” the important word is “control,” not “gun.”The claims presented in this long-circulating “30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed” forward are a mixture of cherry picked or misrepresented statistics, extensive opinion, distortions, and a sprinkling of numbers that occasionally bear a passing resemblance to evidence-based factual reality. A 2016 article by FiveThirtyEight approximated 33,000 (not 30,000) gun deaths per year, 12,000 (not 5,100) of which were homicides — roughly 36 percent. The author of the post repeatedly passes on their opinions of what excludes portions of the data while presenting no citations or basis to do so, and frequently misrepresents or falsifies numbers to make a point. It concludes with a largely incoherent rant about “a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states” and an entreaty that “all death is sad,” assertions which provide little support to the “math” espoused in the commentary’s opening paragraph.On multiple counts, the entire claim is false.",false,"Disinformation, Fact Checks"
1217,15793,"The state of Florida has seen ""double-digit drops"" in alcohol use among teens.","March 18, 2015","Pitman said Florida has seen ""double-digit drops"" in alcohol use among teens. A survey conducted by the state does show double-digit drops for both middle- and high-schoolers over the last decade, though the decline for high schoolers in a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a decline of about 8 percentage points. The statement is accurate but needs additional information.",Joshua Gillin,"As the Legislature considers changing rules for Florida’s burgeoning craft beer industry, one advocacy group is saying it’s important to maintain the state’s downward trend in teen alcohol abuse. During debate at the Senate commerce and tourism committee about whether to let breweries sell 64-ounce growlers, Susan Pitman, a board member for a collection of drug abuse prevention groups called the Florida Coalition Alliance, urged lawmakers to consider limiting pour sizes in beer-tasting rooms. Pitman said that preventing alcohol abuse demands regulation of these tasting rooms. ""While the country as a whole has seen a decline in youth drinking, the state of Florida is a leader, with double-digit drops in 30-day teen alcohol use,"" she said. Pitman’s arguments may have had some impact; sponsor Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, agreed to revisit his bill. But in the meantime, we wondered: Has the declining drinking rate of Florida’s minors really dropped as much as Pitman said? (We considered checking whether Florida’s decline made it a ""leader"" among states, but we backed off after we learned that the state and national numbers -- which also are on the decline -- aren’t precisely comparable.) Pitman, who also serves as executive director of Jacksonville-based Drug Free Duval, told PolitiFact Florida that she got her talking point from the Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey. That’s an annual questionnaire given to middle and high school students in order to collect data about risky behaviors, such as smoking and drug use. The survey is coordinated by the state departments of Children and Families, Education, Health, Juvenile Justice and the Governor's Office of Drug Control. The 2014 report is drawn from answers from almost 70,000 Florida students from all 67 counties. There are several questions measuring alcohol use, including binge drinking and whether kids have ever tried alcohol. But in the category Pitman cites -- the percentage of children who had used alcohol during the past 30 days -- the data show a distinct decrease over the last decade. Grade 2004 2014 Decline, 2004-2014 Middle schoolers 20.3 percent 10.1 percent 10.2 points High schoolers 42.0 percent 28.4 percent 13.6 points That’s a double-digit drop for both categories, providing strong evidence for Pitman’s claim. The only caveat is that there’s a different data set that leads to slightly different results. Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention undertakes a survey for the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. It’s conducted every odd-numbered year during the spring semester for grades 9-12 and for middle schoolers. The 2013 data was culled from more than 13,000 forms filled out in schools across the United States. The CDC survey doesn’t offer 30-day alcohol data for middle schoolers, but it does for high schoolers. For Florida, the survey found that between 2003 and 2013, alcohol use by high schoolers during the previous 30 days dropped from 42.7 percent to 34.8 percent.
